1,Jessica Gonzalez,1,15-Jan-17,179 people found this helpful,I never thought that I would find the right moisturizer for my skin. I have combination skin with large pores that get gunked up if I neglect them and I ve struggled for some time to find a product that would provide sufficient moisture without breaking me out or turning my face into an oil-slick. This is truly a holy grail moisturizer for me and has a nice face feel and natural herbal scent. Will definitely repurchase!  I m a 30 something multi-ethnic muxer and a recent convert to korean beauty. This is my new routine and my skin has never felt or looked bettter!  1) Banila Co Clean It Zero Reservatrol 2) Neogen Green Tea Real Fresh Foam Cleanser 3) MISSHA Time Revolution First Treatment Essence (Morning) or MISSHA Time Revolution Night Repair New Science Ampoule (Night) 4) Cosrx Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion (Morning and ever OTHER night) or Cosrx Ultimate Nourishing Rice Overnight Mask
2,Bichenbrunette,1,13-Jun-17,48 people found this helpful,I started using Kbeauty products after becoming frustrated last year with my increasingly expensive American products that seemed to become less effect as time went on. I found quite a few products that work extremely well by Cosrx  this being one of them. Now as hard as it may be to find the right skincare finding the right moisturizer seems to be a never ending battle no matter what other miracle products may be sitting in your bathroom. I was hesitant to purchase this at first due to the price  & described scent. However the size which is pretty large helps the price & the birch sap smell (not fragrance) that was worrying me actually became a huge bonus! I get horrible headaches/ breakouts if I use anything with a scent  but I do miss being able to use those products so this is the perfect balance for me. As for application I started out using 4-5 pumps  way too much! Less is more  it can lead to a greasy look  however the product isn t actually greasy just concentrated. Now that it s summer I use one pump on my middle finger & rub it between my fingers and then tap it into my face. I ve also applied it with a silicone brush with great results. The bottle again is not tiny so keep that in mind when looking at the price  this is going to last you quite a while. Another Cosrx product that knocks it out of the park  no frills/ misleading marketing messages  just conscious packaging & ingredients. Try the rice mask for night as well  however try & order in the tube it s more hygienic. I ve attached a photo for scale.
3,R. Roberts,1,04-Aug-17,21 people found this helpful,I am new to Asian Beauty and this product is considered one of the best lotions. For a while I have been using rose hip oil to undo a lot of damage done to my skin via sun and over use of drying products. I realized I needed a decent moisturizer that was light weight for my routine morning and night. Now I use this product in the AM/PM and only use the rose hip oil in the PM with the lotion. This lotion is truly light weight. I am very particular about lotions on my face as I cannot stand lotions having any sort of  feel  on my face; too greasy  too drying  too oily  etc. This lotion goes on fairly thick at first but dries quickly. It leaves my skin feeling really smooth and plump. I also like the smell. It is very refreshing. I have only been using this one week but so far everything is good. I have no breakouts or irritation from this product. In fact  I believe it has helped my skin heal and stay hydrated.  For reference I have hormonal acne and dry skin.
4,Jade R,1,03-Apr-17,22 people found this helpful,Exactly what I was looking for! I m in my late 30s  sensitive skin  oily  large pores. This lotion is light and absorbs quickly  doesn t irritate or break out my skin. It also has a nice cooling sensation and lovely clean scent - citrusy-herbal. I apply this at night after BHA + AHA (Cosrx)  then apply a thicker night cream over it. I also use it in the morning but do need to use a matte finishing powder or it gets a bit oily later in the day. I ve been really happy with every Cosrx product I ve tried so far. :)
5,Melinda L.,1,08-Apr-17,36 people found this helpful,This smells amazing. I love citrus smells  this is a combination of the lemon peel and tea tree aroma  a very small hint of herbal/medicinal. It’s white opaque in color and somewhat gel-like  if you lightly tap the product  the way it clings back is somewhat stretchy and bouncy in texture. Reminds me of the Beauty of Joseon Dynasty Cream’s texture but less creamy and lighter. Definitely not oily even though it’s got a little bit of oils in its ingredient list. I have sensitive/combo/ance prone skin  so I like creams that are more water based  less creamy but still moisturizes and this fits the bill. I only use about a pea sized amount and it’s enough to get good coverage. Quick absorption  leaves the skin feeling very hydrated and supple.  Ingredients || Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice  Butylene Glycol  Glycerin  Dimethicone  Betaine  Cetearyl Alcohol 1 2-Hexanediol  Cetearyl Olivate  Sorbitan Olivate  Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer  Sodium Lactate  Ethylhexylglycerin  Sodium Hyaluronate  Allantoin  Panthenol  Xanthan Gum  Ethyl Hexanediol  Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Oil  Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil
6,Niki,1,20-Jul-17,10 people found this helpful,I ve always have dry  sensitive skin. Moderate acne and redness in adulthood have lead me down the Korean beauty track.  NEEDED: Lightweight moisturizer that quenched my skins thirst  but sat under sunscreen well and didn t feel heavy during summer.  Usually I use very heavy moisturizers  Olay  Ponds  Clinique. But switching to Korean beauty routine and products  my skin has gotten amazingly hydrated and adding sunscreen to my daily routine was starting to feel like too much thickness. These are my new moisturizing products after double-cleansing and exfoliating:  - Cosrx Snail Mucin Serum (!! Amazing) - Cosrx Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion  - Corsx Aloe Soothing Suncream (so thick and lovely  AM only)  - Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream (PM only) - Corsx Ultimate Moisturizing Honey overnight Mask (PM only)  I have found all of these products  including this moisturizer  to be of GREAT value for the price point. My skin is clearer than ever and more hydrated  I ve been getting compliments almost every day!  Maybe in winter I will need a heavier cream again  but honestly this routine makes me doubt it. I finally feel like I don t need moisturizer all the time.
7,Emily,0,27-Mar-18,10 people found this helpful,I had read in a blog that this moisturizer was good for combination/oily skin  I have to disagree. My skin became much more oily throughout the day and I broke immediately with little tiny hard bumps almost all over my face after using this product . I continued to use it for 3 weeks in order to give it a decent try  but I could not stand it anymore and went back to my old moisturizer. My skin has improved significantly but I am STILL trying to get rid of these bumps on my forehead like a month later! AND on top of that you can t get a refund. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone who is oily/sensitive/acne prone.
8,Ritz,1,14-Feb-18,7 people found this helpful,What perfection in a daily skin moisturizing cream. This is step 3 in my daily skin care morning practice. Step one is?[ Pyunkang Yul ] Essence Toner 200ml / 6.7 Fl. oz.?to tone my skin  especially nice and hydrating after a hot shower. After that base layer I do a thin layer of?BENTON Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel  100ml?which dries quickly and feels fantastic. Then this beauty is the final step. I use this in the morning and usually at night too if I m lazy and only feel like doing one thing. It last all day and will last all night. Supple skin is my new standard
9,Kevin Duong,0,11-May-18,13 people found this helpful,The one I got says  Formulated with 70.8% Birch sap  and it s supposed to say  Contains...  according to my research of the real product label. It is even on the Amazon images of the product. I believe the one I got is a fake and not only that  my face has got a couple deep big red bumps under the skin that started appearing since I used the product. My skin has also felt more sensitive  with the feeling of stinginess after 3-4 days of use. Be wary of fake sellers.
10,AKLewis,1,26-Jul-18,3 people found this helpful,I have oily skin and this product like many other products leaves a sticky residue on my skin. I still highly recommend this cream for use in the evening to calm your skin after a day of being out and about. It helps to heal breakouts and evens out sebum secretion. After initial night use  you will see a difference the next morning. Unfortunately  it s too heavy for me to feel comfortable using as part of my morning routine. Having oily skin and living in the south can be a challenge! I still recommend this product for its overall calming effect on my skin.
11,Patric H.,1,10-Mar-18,2 people found this helpful,Skin type: oily  acne prone skin.  So within 2 days of using this  the 2 red acne bumps on my chin went away completely. In less than a week  the open acne wound on my forehead stopped being flaky and visibly reduced in size. My skin stays hydrated without being oily. One pump is pea sized and enough for my entire face. I use 1 1/2 pumps to cover my neck as well.  One con~ that others might not like is that there s a slight fragrance smell. I quite like it; smells like hard candy to me. It s there when I first put it on but goes away almost immediately.  I look forward to putting it on in the morning and at night. It s affordable and gonna last forever.  UPDATE: there is also another con. I was using a vitamin C serum  and I find that this moisturizer leaves my skin too greasy as a last step at night. I opted for another lighter moisturizer. Also  as the weather becomes warmer  it also feels heavier and greasier and no longer just hydrating. So I think it works best during the winter or if you live in a cold environment. Or if you have dry skin.
12,Leah,0,19-May-17,4 people found this helpful,Update: Pretty sure this product breaks. Nothing major. Just caused tiny white bumps on my face.  Original review: I love this product. It s definitely a lighter moisturizer  but in the mornings that s what I need. This and sunscreen layered on top works perfectly. You don t have to use much. I expect this bottle to last at least 3 months  probably longer  now that I m no longer using it in the evenings. It has a very nice light fragrance. Great stuff.
13,Catherine K,1,02-Sep-17,5 people found this helpful,This lotion is great! It s light  a small amount spreads easily and sinks in quickly. It almost seems to form a barrier between the skin and the makeup. It s the first lotion in 45 years that doesn t cause me irritation or breakouts  it doesn t seem to have any BHA/BHT or coconut oil in the ingredients which has irritated me for years  I just found out that I was sensitive to these things. I m so happy I found something that works  finally.
14,Kelsey,1,31-Dec-17,2 people found this helpful,I have oily skin which is sometimes acne-prone/sensitive and this was sooooo close to being the perfect moisturizer. Except  for some weird reason  it stings my face and makes it a bit oilier than normal. It doesn t burn  just a little stinging when I first put it on  and the oiliness is taken care of with powder  but please be aware if you have sensitive skin  it could bother you too.  Pros: -didn t cause any breakouts -sanitary dispenser which works really well  no leaking and dispenses the perfect amount -bottle lasts a long time - lasted about 3 months using morning & night -Texture is very nice  not sticky  but feels very hydrating & plays well when layering other products/makeup  Cons: -I experienced some slight stinging when applying. Be careful if you have sensitive skin/any allergies.
15,Amazon Customer,1,03-Jun-17,5 people found this helpful,This wonderful moisturizer has truly delivered for my dehydrated  acne-prone skin! I used the Clinique Moisturizing Gel for years before I switched to this  and where the Clinique gel seemed to evaporate within 20 minutes after application and left my skin still wanting  this moisturizer is wonderfully occlusive  and keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day! This product has helped me restore my skin s natural moisture barrier  which had been severely compromised after years of harsh acne treatments. I like to layer this over my toner/oils/serums at night to seal all the goodies in place. During the day  I pat sunscreen over the moisturizer.
16,Sarah Sinclair,0,29-Jun-18,3 people found this helpful,The REAL product is amazing  it gives me moisture no matter what my skin state is without being too heavy. It is the perfect year-round moisturizer. I ve tried to explore other products  but no matter what I always come back to this one. The SAD thing is  I received a COUNTERFEIT item. I only know because I have bought this product from other sellers multiple times. The description is different  bottle is cheaper quality  and general graphic qualities of the print on the bottle is completely different. BE CAREFUL!
17,Pockyman,1,07-Feb-18,2 people found this helpful,This moisturizer is amazing. For people with normal- oily skin  like myself  this alone will suffice as a moisturizer. I need only 1 and 1/2 pumps to cover my face  under my chin and neck. If you have dry skin  this may work if you use 2-3 pumps. Right after I cleanse and tone  I pat the lotion onto my skin before my face starts to feel dry. I think that is the key to using this product effectively. It also has a clean refreshing scent... almost like the smell of sprite/ seven up when you open a new bottle. However  the scent disappears almost immediately. One bottle lasts me 4-6 months depending on the season and I use it twice a day.
18,AB,1,08-Apr-17,3 people found this helpful,This is my Holy Grail moisturizer for extremely lazy days when I don t feel like slathering heavy cream on my face. I love the hygenic dispenser  the scent  and texture of this product. I was taken aback by how hydrating this light moisturizer was but then I remembered this is a product from Cosrx. Cosrx is such a solid skincare brand tbh. I highly recommend that everyone checks their other stuff out (such as the Snail Mucin Essence and Pimple Pads). Your skin and wallet will thank you.
19,AK,1,07-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,I have combination (37 yr old)  sensitive  acne-prone skin. Mostly have cleared my acne-prone skin in the last couple years with the exception of hormonal breakouts during that time of the month  sometimes minimal  other time more troublesome. This product is wonderful whether you practice 10-step k-beauty regimen  something similar  or just looking for a solid moisturizer to lock in/imorove your skin s hydration. Has a beautiful light lotion consistency that absorbs quickly which provides heavy moisture without any greasy  heavy feeling. Highly recommended for those with similar skin  would buy again.
20,Herbie W.,1,23-Feb-18,2 people found this helpful,Been using this COSRX Oil Free Ultra Moisturizing lotion for a couple days now. I was using Dermalogica Oil Control lotion previously  which I like  but by the end of the day  the oil tends to prevail. I normally have pretty oily/sheeny skin (Asian)  but this product seems to keep the oil at bay and keeps my face feeling moisturized and fresh all day! After three days  I m very pleased. I ll give an update if anything changes.
21,Madison White,1,07-Mar-17,5 people found this helpful,I only ever need one pump of this as an emulsion (before I put on a thicker cream and sunscreen)  and my skin has had so much improvement since I ve used it in terms of staying moisturized and keeping water in my skin. It does have a bit of a strange scent  but it s more herbal/earthy smelling than chemical  so I don t mind. Came here before the time Amazon projected so I m more than happy with that! I think I m going to make this my go-to emulsion for my skin care routine. <3  (For reference  I am dry/combo  so you could maybe get away with using this as your only moisturizer if you lean more oily.)
22,Lydia Cook,1,05-Mar-19,2 people found this helpful,Great  light  moisturizer! Not enough for my dehydrated combo skin in the winter  but it will work well in the summer. I ve been mixing Rosehip seed and Squalane oil in with it to give it some extra moisturizing factors.
23,Angel,1,05-Apr-17,4 people found this helpful,This stuff stinks like chinese herbal medicine but it seems to be moisturizing my face really well. I have really oily acne prone skin and this hasn t caused any breakouts yet so that s a plus. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a super moisturizing lotion for their face !!!
24,AA,1,16-Jul-17,2 people found this helpful,I ve only been using this product for two days so I can t say much about its long-term effect  however  this smells amazing  like lemon candy. I had to come back to this page and read the ingredients to make sure there wasn t any added fragrance  and there doesn t seem to be. On top of the amazing smell  the product is super light weight and seems to absorb quickly without leaving a tacky film on my skin. I layer another lightweight moisturizer on top of this and that seems to do the trick.
25,Julia DeVoe,1,11-May-19,,I have an oily t-zone and dry patches and have a hard time with moisturizers balancing both. This stuff however is the best I ve come across yet. Its kinda like a gel-lotion and it smells like Mt. Dew oddly. I work 12 hr shifts and have tested this moisturizer for 3 days now and it has kept my oils at bey without drying me out! You also get a generous amount of product for a decent price. I will be repurchasing.  *I also purchased the COSRX Shield Fit All Green Comfort Sun SPF 50 and have been using it in conjunction with this moisturizer. I LOOOVE it as well!
26,E&J BAX,1,05-Oct-18,One person found this helpful,Another K beauty favorite I use with the 7 layer skincare regimen. I use a small amount and press it in just as Gothamista on youtube recommends. I wait a few minutes and then put a final layer on top with something a bit richer for overnight- Is a little tacky on its own. Definitely needs another layer over it  but is a fantastic natural humectant. Has a natural smell of birch to it but is not irritating at all
27,Melissa,1,16-Feb-19,,I freaking LOVED this lotion the second I put it on my skin. It has a really gentle smell and is perfect for a light daytime lotion. The only problem was that it makes my rosacea flare a little bit. I’m guessing from the tea tree or lemon. So I had to pass it on to my sister who is oily and acne prone which it’s perfect for. I honestly kept using it longer than I should have because I liked it so much. I was sad to have to pass it on. Basically if your skin is oily and can tolerate light scents you’ll love this lotion.
28,Kindle Customer,0,20-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I used this product for a couple of days and by the end of it I had a rough bumpy texture on my face. When I looked in the mirror up close I could see a bunch of tiny red bumps and the texture couldnt be hidden with makeup. I was very disappointed because I liked the feel of the product because it absorbed nicely but the reaction I got was basically a rash of some sort. Before I realized the damage it was doing I had rubbed some of the excess profuct I had on my hands onto my arm and it immediately itched and became red and inflamed. It s a full week later and my face and arm are still not completely back to normal. I have sensitive acne prone skin and don t recommend this product for people who share the same skin type.
29,Brittney,1,28-Jun-19,,Im really glad I decided to purchase this. It has such a nice feel on your skin  almost cooling  and it makes my face feel fresh and moisturized  without any of the thickness that other moisturizers have given me in the past. I don t like that semi-tacky feeling of heavy creams  so the texture of this is perfect to me. Plus  it doesn t have any strong or artificial smelling fragrance. Highly recommend for people who have oily skin  or people who just want a no hassel  quick absorbing moisturizer.
30,Alexandra,1,14-Sep-17,2 people found this helpful,This stuff is amazing! I was looking for a new light moisturizer for the summer and I never expected to love this so much! It hydrates the face very nicely and sinks into my skin perfectly and my skin feels so soft whenever I use this. I typically use 3-4 pumps on my face since I have oily skin but this lotion is light enough to where 3-4 pumps seem perfectly fine for my skin type. It layers well with my essences/ serums/sunscreen as well! AND WORKS AWESOME UNDER MAKEUP! The lotion has a very fresh scent due to having a high amount of birch sap in the ingredients but the smell is so refreshing. I always look forward to using this every morning! 10/10 would buy again!
31,Thala,1,24-May-18,,Absolutely recommend. My skin is very sensitive. I also have combination skin  so anything too heavy makes me oily  but anything too light just doesn t do the job and I get dry patches. It might be a combination of my new essence and toner that I got with this  but on days I ve used this all by itself I ve noticed that my skin absorbs it very quickly. It s very light but moisturizes very well without feeling oily or sticky. The scent is very faint. Slightly  woodsy  but not overwhelming like cologne or something. It s actually very natural and refreshing in my opinion. I love this stuff. Definitely will buy again.
32,Nathan Dew,1,27-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,I m on my 2nd bottle of the Oil Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion by COSRX. First off  while Korean products are generally better quality ingredients than the U.S. and gentle on the skin  COSRX products are ESPECIALLY gentle and good for sensitive skin.  This lotion is a thicker  more viscous consistency than an essence for example  but is still very light and doesn t feel overbearing. It only takes 2-3 pumps to get some good application and I find my skin feels very calm  soft and moisturized after this. Sun cream layers perfectly fine on top of this lotion.  I d recommend for anyone who s looking for a gentle and simple  but still good quality moisturizer.
33,citlali,1,10-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,I have oily  acne prone  sensitive skin. Have been using this for about 3 weeks and its really good. I just got into talking care of my skin. This is the fist moisturizer I have used. Its great when my skin is irritated for whatever reason it helps so much. Love everything it does. The only reason I m not giving it five stars is because I don t like how it leaves a film over my skin is almost unnoticeable but I can feel it. In not sure if others notice it. Other then that its great. Will not re punches again because its the first moisturizer I ve had. Have to look around and see what is out there.
34,Artemis,1,17-Oct-17,2 people found this helpful,Very moisturizing  I use it under makeup and it hasn t broken me out even with my acne prone skin. I was only using it at night when it was still warm outside but now that it s cold  I use it after washing my face in the morning and night. Smells somewhat minty and similar to Vaporub.
35,zoey,1,20-Aug-17,One person found this helpful,I m 40 and have dry sensitive skin. I use this in the morning and something heavier at night. Product is working well for me. I m not in love with the smell  it s like tree sap but it goes away quickly. Currently using Cetaphil face wash  Tatcha oil make up remover  CosRx galactmyces toner and essence  this lotion in day  SK-II anti aging eye cream (stem cell) and SK-ii anti aging cream at night. Sometime I spritz some Whamisa mist on.
36,Crystal Y.,0,14-Jul-18,2 people found this helpful,I’ve read some reviews about this lotion being fake by the  formulated with 70.8%....  printed on it instead of  contains with.... . I also looked up multiple reviews off of videos and images but most of the bottles show  contains  instead of  formulated . Im bit disappointed and afraid to use it if it will potentially cause a bad reaction. If it is actually a fake product beware (I got it from the seller MR.RX).
37,Maya,1,02-Jan-17,4 people found this helpful,This is the best facial lotion I have tried so far that doesn t overdry my skin  lead to breakouts or leave my skin super oily. Absorbs quite nicely on application but I feel like it doesn t moisturize enough so I only use this at night. For day wear I would recommend a more heavy duty moisturizer. Overall  love the scent (smells a bit like coca cola gummies) and feeling of this light moisturizer.
38,Aya,1,20-Nov-17,2 people found this helpful,I ve never loved a moisturizer as much as I love this one! It s very lightweight & feels great under makeup and after my other skincare steps. If my skin is very dry  I like to double up applications before i go to bed as a sort of sleep mask.
39,Leon,0,09-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,I don t know if anyone had this problem  but for whatever reason this changed the color of my foundation. For weeks it s been just oxidizing whiter and pinker (I have a neutral to yellow undertone) than it did before and I ve been wracking my head trying to figure out what in my routine was changing it so dramatically.  As a moisturizer  it s fine. It didn t particularly wow me  though I really did like the scent  some sort of cola (sprite?). Maybe I ll use it for the days I don t put makeup on but for now this is going to the back of the shelf.
40,Jill,1,18-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,I m a big fan of Korean skincare. I ve come to love this lightweight moisturizer made with birch. The smell is distinctly birch  but doesn t linger. Lightweight-- perfect to use under your foundation for the day. Also great to use post-ampoule  but before your heavy nighttime moisturizer if you re doing a 10 step thing.
41,HeatHaze,1,14-Sep-17,2 people found this helpful,I like the way this makes my skin feel. It glides on and penetrates like an oil moisturizer leaving your skin soft and silky. My face never gets oily or greasy feeling all day. This will be good to layer with a heavier lotion during colder months.
42,S.C.,1,21-Jun-19,,It’s light and spreads well. It’s not oily. I like the scent. I feel it’s moisturizing. It’s great for a sensitive skin. It feels a bit sticky but it goes away after several minutes. I haven’t had any break outs. I’ve been using for several weeks now. I’ll purchase another one when I run out.
43,Anju,0,30-Jun-18,3 people found this helpful,It was a fake one . Made my skin feel tight and horrible had to return it.
44,Amazon Customer,0,07-Mar-18,2 people found this helpful,COSRX Oil Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion with Birch Sap  100ml  I was really excited to use this product because I heard so much about it. The moment I put it on my face  my face started reacting - my face stung and I started getting rashes. Not sure if this is fake... or my skin could be allergic to birch sap. My skin is still trying to recover from using this product. Would it be possible at all to get my money back.
45,J,1,22-Jun-17,One person found this helpful,Love this lotion  it is very light weight and moisturizing. I say this is great for a spring season. Now that it s summer  I do feel like this lotion does not provide enough moisture to keep up with the summer weather but overall  this is still a great lotion. I have dry/sensitive skin so the moisture level is not enough for me on summer days.
46,Diane,1,16-May-19,,I found this works well for my combination/oily skin. I don t have sensitive skin so I can t say whether the birch sap will irritate people or not  but it definitely moisturizes mine without causing more acne. It s unscented  but I prefer that since scented products aren t really great for your skin.
47,Amazon Customer,1,25-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,This moisturizer has a citrus-y smell. It feels really good on my skin! It s so light that it feels like nothing is there  while your face feels refreshed. This is the first moisturizer I ve used where it s light weight but effective on my skin. My brother likes it too.
48,Zee,1,30-Jun-19,,The box was open for this item when I opened my package. A bit worrying even though I bought this item from the official COSRX Amazon seller. There’s no seal on the box plus the moisturizer uses a pump so obviously a safety seal in the bottle itself is non-existent.  Still my go to moisturizer and there was no change in consistency or smell from the last time I remembered it. Just a bit worrying for the customer’s peace of mind seeing the box wide open for this item once my amazon package arrived hence 4 stars.
49,Amazon Customer,1,24-Sep-17,2 people found this helpful,This is an awesome  natural  deep and affordable moisturizer for my oily/acne prone skin! I try to use all natural or Korean/ European products as they have much stricter regulations about the kinds of ingredients that can go in their products. The cosmetics industry in the US is kind of a free-for-all in comparison... I like to stick this in the fridge a few minutes before I use it for a cooling experience.
50,Chris,1,26-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,Very light and smooth facial cream. Though it is very light  it is still moisturizing enough even in the very dry Virginia winter climate. Only thing that could be improved is the smell. Someone else on here described it as  Sprite  but I think it s just sort of sweet smelling.. It s not bad  but I would prefer a more mature scent. Certainly you won t smell it after it s gone on.
51,Rachel,1,25-May-18,,This is my first time purchasing this moisturizer and so far I am incredibly happy with it. I am in my early/mid twenties and struggle with hormonal acne  dehydrated skin  large pores  and fine lines. This is the only moisturizer so far that has been able to moisturize my skin adequately without causing more breakouts or clogging pores. My skin feels incredibly hydrated and my acne has lessened a bit (I also use the Cosrx bha blackhead serum and Epiduo). My skin looks more dewy/plumped and the fine lines look slightly less visible. The lotion also smells great (a subtle fresh lemon/tea tree oil scent). I will continue to repurchase and am impressed once again with Cosrx.
52,Tony H,0,04-Feb-18,,Did not work for my oily and acne prone skin. It did not feel heavy upon application but my skin became extra oily after only about two hours and it did not help existing breakouts at all. This product is hit or miss depending on your skin. Does not work for oily skin in general. The product also did not come with a safety seal but pump and box looked new.
53,Susana,1,07-Jul-17,One person found this helpful,This moisturizer is amazing for acne-prone skins! I searched a lot online and Youtube for the perfect moisturizer  and I came across this one. I have very dry skin in the Winter and oily in the Summer  and is so easy for me to break out (I need to use oil free make up  sunscreen  and don t eat too much junk food etc). But this product did not cause me to break out and it leaves your face super moisturized! 10/10 would recommend.
54,TO,1,18-Jun-18,,Its so light and nice. I personally love the scent. I m super dry after cleansing my face but get really oily if I use a regular cream so I prefer this since it doesn t make me look like an oily mess after putting it on. Its also cooling so its nice in the summer
55,Neur0n,1,21-Jan-18,,Has solid ingredients and it s very moisturizing. Also goes on normal without that greasy feeling or look. The only issue is that it has an herbal and tea tree type of smell to it upon initial application but it dissipates 5-10 mins after. Other than that  it s a solid lotion and I definitely recommend it.
56,Monica Patterson,1,27-Apr-19,,The scent is reminiscent of a mild essential oil. A little woodsy  but not overpowering. I enjoyed the scent every time I put it on. Very lightweight  but my skin felt amazing  and moisturized better than when I use heavier creams!
57,bdbaxter13,1,29-Oct-17,,AMAZING. I have really sensitive skin that is on the dry side  and a friend recommended that I try this. Not only is it cruelty free  like so many Korean beauty products  but it makes my skin feel brand new and doesn t burn or cause any redness or itching. I will never use anything else for my face. My husband uses it too  and it doesn t have a smell that is particularly masculine or feminine  so it s perfect for both of us.
58,Rachel,1,16-Jan-18,,This is my new favorite moisturizer. Not too oily  but not for folks who want something for super dry skin. it fully absorbs into my skin and doesnt make me feel greasy. Great under foundation or great to mix with foundation if you don t need as much coverage. The bottle is the exact maximum size to take on a carry on bag on the airplane
59,Abigail Page,1,15-Feb-17,,I didn t realize how much my skin needed this until I used a different moisturizer (Pacifica) for 2 weeks - this stuff is so hydrating for your skin. It makes everything you put over it look much more natural. I have oily but dehydrated skin and this keeps that tired look at bay. It also lasted me about 4 months with regular use. Love it.
60,MJT,0,16-Apr-17,3 people found this helpful,This combined with the low PH face wash made me break out. Has a very astringent smell. If you re allergic or sensitive to fragrance in products skip this product.
61,Kshine,1,13-Sep-17,One person found this helpful,I have oily skin so i need a moisturizer for the summer and this was awsome ! It was very hydrating but not oily and greasy. let my face smooth and soft and hydrating . would definitely buy this again .
62,DiL,1,11-Sep-18,,This is a light and gentle  non-greasy moisturizer. It pairs nicely with the AHA/BHA toner and power liquid  helping to calm down the skin afterwards. I ve only been using it for a couple of weeks  but so far so good.
63,Dr Aks,1,04-Jun-19,,I’m new to Cos RX brand. My first purchase was their good morning cleanser. Then I got this moisturizer. It’s perfect. It’s Lightweight. Hydrating. Perfect for all skin types. Absolutely love it.
64,Cloudy Skies,0,29-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,The pump broke off before I could even use it. Like seriously. I can’t even get the black pump out of the cap  and I’ve tried to break the clear cap to no avail. The only reason why I even bought this Korean moisturizer over the other brands was because it had a pump system. I was so excited to try this  too.
65,Yessica Hannon,1,24-Jun-17,One person found this helpful,I have oily acne prone skin and I hated moisturizers that left my skin feeling sticky and heavy and clogged up my pores. I was using the Clinique 3 step system from Ulta and the hydrating cream didn t really do anything for me. The first time I used Cosrx Moisturizer I was in love  it had this wonderful cooling sensation it was light but it hydrated my skin so wonderfully. I ve been using it for over 2 weeks now and I ve seen a difference in my skin it feels slot more hydrated and brighter.
66,ytk,0,19-Feb-18,5 people found this helpful,Review update: this broke me out in tiny  tiny little white bumps all over the sides of my face and cheeks. Seems to work for many other people  but it clogged my pores.  I have combination skin with slightly drier cheeks. Lotion is lightweight  skin soaks in quickly  herb-y scent. Moderate hydration. I recommend using with other skincare (essence  cream  etc.) Do not recommend for people looking for intense hydration. This is a nice lotion that works well with other skincare productions for additional moisture.
67,Zenster,1,03-Mar-18,,Best Moisturizer I have ever used. Light and not greasy and no dry skin. I use as little as possible during the day to avoid shine and then more at night. No dry skin and best of all does not clog pores. This Birch Sap may be a great new discovery!
68,Chris McCoy,1,19-Mar-19,,Love love love. My aloe lotion wasnt quite doing it for me this winter and I ve had good luck with other cosrx products so I gave this a shot. Not only did it cure my scaly  flaky skin but it didn t make me break out  or make my skin feel oily. This product is now going to be a must have for me.
69,Amazon Customer,1,19-May-19,,this is the second time i bought the cosrx ... i used as my daily moisturizer  it feels light and doesnt give me any break outs...skin feels hydrated all the time.
70,Lorax,1,16-Apr-17,One person found this helpful,Consistency is thicker/creamier than I d expected  reminds me of the texture of cetaphil. Smells lightly tea-tree and citrussy to me  which fades quickly. Spreads easily on the skin and soaks in well. Doesn t have any silicones in it which I appreciate  but that does mean that some silicone-y creams will ball up on top of it.
71,Amazon Customer,1,18-Jan-18,,I have combination/oily skin and this stuff is awesome. It hydrates my dry areas but also sinks right in to the skin. It’s a lightweight gel consistency and I love the scent. Really great stuff!
72,a.rose,1,06-Feb-18,,Best moisturizer I’ve ever used! It’s great for nighttime or morning use  it’s not too heavy under makeup. My skin has never been this soft! I use it with the Cosrx snail mucin and it’s the perfect combo for me.
73,Marie Gallardo,1,15-Dec-18,,My absolute favorite moisturizer! Super moisturizing and doesn t feel oily at all afterwards. It doesn t break out my acne prone skin which is always a pro. This is a must have for acne prone/oily skin

77,Michelle P,1,18-Apr-19,,Very gentle for my sensitive skin. Skin is naturally oily  and still tends to get that way overtime but i love the moisture level.
78,Shirley,1,26-Jun-19,,I love this COSRX moisturizer! It’s very calming and soothing on the skin because of the birch sap and tea tree oil! This moisturizer doesn’t feel heavy on the face and is non-greasy! I can’t wait to try other COSRX face products!
79,colleen connors,1,11-Aug-18,,I recently purchased a bunch of Cosrx products since following Asian Beauty on Reddit and I can’t rave enough about the product. This moisturizer is very lightweight but provides enough moisture to not make my skin dry throughout the day. Can’t beat the price either especially for the ingredients in their products.
80,S. Johnson,1,22-Jan-18,,Nice  smooth face lotion. Just two drops is enough for the whole face and neck. Good moisturizing. Doesn t make me break out. Mild  kind of woodsy scent. Cruelty-free and vegan. Love it!

82,Jessica,1,28-Oct-16,3 people found this helpful,I struggle with oily  acne-prone skin and have trouble finding a moisturizer that feels light  but throughly hydrates. This lotion leaves my skin hydrated and plump  without looking greasy. I also enjoy the fresh smell. Definitely a winner!
83,Michelle,1,29-Apr-18,,Good product! Didn’t break me out! Just I had to use another moisturizer after using this!! Since i have dry skin.
84,Luisina Rolon Luna,0,04-Jul-19,,Nunca fui quisquilloza con las fragancias  pero esta simil a mentol siento que me irrita. La uso en la zona t  en la zona de la rosacea la evito  lo cual es a veces un problema por que estq muy cerca de los poros dilatados. Si no tenes piel sensible y ademas piel oleosa es ideal  pero si sos de piel sensible evitala.
85,Tiff,1,30-Apr-18,,I appreciated that it didn t make my face feel oily. I have oily/combination skin and my T-zone gets to fried levels when I m out and about in the day. I didn t see it benefitting my skin  acne-wise.
86,Avarwen,1,17-Mar-18,,Moisturizes without leaving skin oily love this lotion as someone with extremely oily skin this has been a great boon to me and has allowed me to use lotion again.

89,Eric,1,01-Dec-17,,It s an okay moisturizer  although it does feel oily. The nozzle also fell off after a few weeks and now it s just loosely hanging on.
90,Amazon Customer,1,30-Aug-17,,Love this lotion!! Smells great & feels so light on my face. I have very oily acne prone skin. I have been using the whole cosrx system for the past 5 days all I can say is wow! No new break outs and my skin looks good and at the end of the day still feels hydrated without being so greasy. Usually I feel greasy n shiny right after I wash my face n do my makeup. Cant say enough about these products  but thank you cosrx!
91,Hannah B.,1,11-Feb-19,,I love the way this stuff smells...herbal. The consistency is good too  not too thin and not too thick. It does not moisturize enough for me in the winter but this will be great in the summer!
92,Sherri Godlin,0,19-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,this product is most DEFINITELY a counterfeit. The smell is extremely potent  smells sort of like gatorade powder. It also has blatant grammatical errors on the bottle. DO NOT PURCHASE. made me break out.
93,Mari,1,03-Jun-19,,My favorite in my skin routine. It’s light not fragrant and instantly moisturizes your skin while Not leaving a residue
94,christina,1,08-May-18,,This brand/product is amazing! This is literally the perfect daytime moisturizer  and I feel like this could be used in the summer and winter months. It has such a silky light consistency and just absorbs so easily into your skin leaving a smooth finish. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone with combination to oily skin.
95,mitz1002,1,04-Jun-18,,One of the bestselling products of CosRx as what I was told. And it remained true to its promise after using it for almost 2 months  it made my skin more supple and younger looking. I have sensitive skin and this one didn t irritate my skin a bit. Will keep buying for more CosRx products  im a big fan now!
96,Lizzy,1,05-Aug-17,,I LOVE this product. It smells good. It feels good. It s so light and it keeps my skin soft and moisturized without getting greasy. A+ recommend to everyone with dry  oil  or combination skin.
97,Madison,1,03-Jan-19,,Very lightweight and perfect for ppl like me who have oily skin. The smell is nice too.
98,Jay,1,19-Nov-18,,Hydrating without being greasy. Actually helped out my acne. Has a scent to it but not that overwhelming. Formula is a bit thicker  but once applied it smooths out and absorbs right into the skin. 10/10 recommend (basically found my new go to moisturizer and now on my second bottle).
99,Avo,1,19-Jan-18,,Very moisturizing even during the dry winter months  doesn t make me break out. This is occlusive is exactly what was missing from my routine.
100,Daniel B.,1,02-Sep-17,,I have sensitive oily combo skin (gets dry patches during winter) and this doesn t leave my skin oily. I like the substance/consistency a lot. I used it in 2 ways  after my toner and then also after my serum. It worked really well both ways for me. Certainly a very hydrating lotion!
101,4ajashley,1,30-Aug-18,,This is the only moisturizer I use that won t turn me into a glazed donut. It doesn t irritate my oily combination skin; it actually makes it feel soft and healthy. It really helped with a lot of my outbreaks  and I haven t used any other moisturizers since then.
102,SC,1,17-Jun-19,,Very moisturizing
103,Christopher,1,16-Jan-17,,A light and effective moisturizer. A delightful scent that lingers for a while  but dissipates in an hour or so. Very hydrating  quick absorbing  and long lasting product. As a COSRX fan  I m not surprised. The entire line is stellar.

It s also very affordable  and a little amount goes a long way  this has lasted me months:)

After the first day I immediately just switched over and it is the only moisturizer I use (with the exception of twice a week I ll use my aloe/night mask). I absolutely love this moisturizer and highly recommended to friends and family.  Note: I have oily tzone  nothing too crazy but I do consider my skin oily/mixed

178,Coinoperated,1,12-Sep-16,6 people found this helpful,Bought this to replace my Origins zero oil moisturizer. I needed to cut back on my skin care budget. I was getting out of hand. lol. This thing is awesome! I can t say enough good things about it. It s light  obviously  and goes on smoothly with no greasy feeling. It sinks in fairly quickly for a moisturizer. Oh  and I love the scent! It s a light  almost herb like smell that goes away quickly  but I always look forward to the application because of the scent. At first I didn t like the pump because I felt like it didn t distribute enough product  but as I got accustomed to using it  I found that one pump was all I needed! I ve had it for a few months and I haven t even gone through 1/4 of it yet  just about to get there. I only use this in the morning though  since I own a night cream already. I would re-purchase this again  but I m not even sure when I ll finish the bottle. It s going to last me a long while. Which is great if your like me and are on a budget. I have combo skin. I m not sure if I would recommend this to people with dry skin because it may not moisturize well enough for you  but for the price point  give it a try  you never know!

180,Luna E.,1,21-Mar-17,6 people found this helpful,A Holy Grail item for me. Combined with MIZON Snail Recovery Gel  it s the perfect amount of moisture for my oily skin. I have been trying to get into the Korean skincare thing but frankly am still confused by it all. In the West we usually just have very simple routines of cleanser and moisturizer and that s about it. Trying to find a Korean equivalent of a moisturizer has been really confusing because there s not really a direct equivalent  instead the Korean way is all about layering a bunch of serums and ampoules and creams after cleansing  from thinnest to heaviest. Or so I understand it. I don t want to do a complicated 10-step routine so now my daily routine is just this:  1. Oil cleanser 2. Gentle soapy cleanser (water based) 3. This product 4. MIZON Snail Recovery Gel  Basically  this product is a moisturizer in my book. The closest equivalent I ve found so far to your basic drugstore Western moisturizer  except way higher quality. Puts Western products to shame. It s a light gel-like lotion. I ve been using this for months and my skin looks great  I m definitely going to reorder when it runs out. It s usually enough hydration for my oily skin  but if you have dry skin you might want to look at something else.

Not sure what is lemon peel oil for  but it definitely delivers a STRONG citrus/lemon scent. If you are sensitive to fragrance  proceed with cautious. Tea tree oil may degrade over time so take your chance.

188,Tina W.,1,13-May-17,,This is a pretty light moisturizer. I pair it with other products and it doesn t feel too heavy as a result.
189,laura,1,24-Jun-17,,Very nice and light moister cream!
190,Angelie Morano,1,14-May-17,,This lotion is lightweight and keeps my face moisturized. I just use one pump :)
191,Shelly A Robinson,1,27-Jan-17,,Smells very nice  and moisturizes without leaving skin feel heavy or oily.
192,Amazon Customer,1,11-Dec-17,,It feels so good on the skin  doesn’t clog pores
193,whitney,1,12-Sep-17,,This is such a great everyday moisturizer. My skin soaks it up quickly in the morning before I apply makeup  which is great. My skin is normal and this moisturizer provides enough moisture for me during the day  at night I tend to use something heavier ( except in the summer). My skin has been pretty clear  due to this product in conjunction with other skincare products. Not to mention the ingredient list is so amazing  the main ingredient ( Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice) is the first ingredient  rather than at the bottom. This is great  because I find that many American products advertise a product under some grand ingredient but when you look at the ingredient list  its at the bottom. The price is great too for the amount of product you get. Would definitely repurchase.
194,klei,1,24-Jul-17,,Smells amazing. Perfect to use after a serum.
195,Zebiba Salih,1,20-Jul-17,,One of my holy grail moisturizers!
196,Emma,1,30-Jan-17,One person found this helpful,I love this so much  I use it as my daytime moisturizer  it has a nice scent  and it goes on smoothly and soaks in after a minute or two  I ve been kind of hopping from moisturizer to moisturizer but I think this one is here to stay. It s nice and light  doesn t clog your pores and is good for acne prone skin too. Love COSRX
197,Jen K.,1,31-Dec-17,,As you can see I m pretty much done with my first bottle. At the beginning I thought it was good but I HATED the smell - a little bit minty and tea tree oil. All COSRX products I ve tried have that smell (I also love their low pH cleanser). It gives me enough moisture  it doesn t feel greasy  heavy or sticky. My skin absorbs it really fast and I can feel it retains moisture the whole day. I use it during the morning after my vitamin c serum and during the night after my treatments. For your reference I have normal skin but depending on the weather it can get oily around my nose but the rest is pretty much normal to dry-ish. I never thought I would buy this product again but I freaking love it. I used to use the Clinique Dramatically Different Gel but this product is half the price and way better. I got mine on February and I get 2 to 3 uses out of it  you only need 1 or 2 pumps.  I think COSRX is cruelty-free  I read it somewhere but I m not 100% sure.
198,Em,1,29-Mar-17,One person found this helpful,The perfect day moisturizer for my combo  sensitive  dehydrated  acne-prone skin. It is light and absorbs quickly. Not a fan of the lemony pine-sol smell  but this is a permanent part of my SOKO skincare regimen.
199,Kimberly,1,07-Apr-17,,This is a lightweight yet super moisturizing lotion. I love the texture of it and how well it sits under makeup. I have rosacea  and it didn t irritate me at all. This contains tea tree oil  which is great for acne but gives the product a strong smell  which is the only thing I disliked. I bought this along side other products and started breaking out quite a bit  but I m not sure if it was this product or one of the others.
200,ACPomma,1,23-Nov-16,3 people found this helpful,This is a great moisturizer. It delivers what it promises - lightweight moisturization for your face. I have oily skin and this moisturizes my face without ever looking greasy. It takes a hot second to absorb  but it s still pretty quick. When you are rubbing it or patting it on your face  it feels like velvet. It s lovely. You only need 1 pump for your whole face  it doesn t look like much but it spreads every well. The only reason I took a star off was because there is a scent to it  that I don t personally like. I think it s because of the birch sap. It does disappear once fully absorbed  but it did take a little getting used to. To me  the benefits definitely outweigh the smell.
201,Umaru Doma,0,29-Nov-17,3 people found this helpful,I have found other sources saying that this is actually not a moisturizer it’s a toner.  I generally like this brand a lot but I do not like this product. Unless you have EXTREMELY dry skin stay away. I have combination skin so I thought it would be alright but it literally feels like putting oil on your face. Which is weird... it says oil free but I’ve never used a more oily product. I think it made me break out as well. I really wanted to return it and put the money towards belif aqua bomb which I like much better and doesn’t cause breakouts. Sadly I’m not able to return it and I honestly have no idea what to do with it.
202,Mim Plavin,0,14-Jan-17,2 people found this helpful,This caused an allergic reaction for me -- around my eyes. Super bummed because I wanted to like it and use it. I have super sensitive skin.
203,Ena,1,31-Dec-16,One person found this helpful,Fast delivery  authentic. Too bad the product didn t work for me. I ve officially given up on cosrx.
204,Student for Life,1,30-Jun-16,4 people found this helpful,It s lightly scented but the scent is pleasant. It absorbs into the skin quickly and does not leave any residue. After using this for a few days the texture of my skin is nicer and my face is definitely softer. Would definitely buy again.

208,Jessica,0,13-Nov-16,6 people found this helpful,Firstly  I have combination skin type. I was very excited to try this out after seen many good reviews. But it only bring me disappointment and not up to the hype. This seems to be gel like texture. When I applied to my skin  it feels very sticky as the lotion only stay on the surface to my skin and doesn t get absorbed...and i feel some heat after apply it. I really want to love this but I can t....Please let me know if anybody have the same experience as me.
209,Darin,0,12-May-17,2 people found this helpful,I really wanted to like this lotion because I stand by a lot of other cosrx products  but this just did not jive well with my skin. I have oily/combination skin and I was looking for a good moisturizer to put on for both day and night. To start off with the positives  I love the smell and packaging. It has a citrus scent  which I love. That s pretty much where the love ends for me.  The consistency is sticky  and while it spreads evenly  this lotion leaves a film on the surface of your skin. Even when I apply just a tiny amount after I allow the toner to absorb  the lotion feels slimy and sticky on my skin. It just didn t set into my skin well at all. I m also no skin guru  but something in this product irritated my skin and I felt a slight burning sensation and it was left pink afterward. After using this for about two weeks  I noticed I began to break out in areas I usually didn t and that my pores were congested and were very visible. I knew at the point that this lotion was not for me.  It s really unfortunate because I love the good morning wash and aha/bha toner from their line  but this was a huge disappointment. I don t see how this is good for those who have oily or combo skin. It s really heavy overall and the absorption is poor  not refined at all.
210,Jenny,0,16-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,I got this product around the Fall time. Understanding colder weather  my face will need something more moisturizer than what I used in the Summer. For a good month  I pump once or twice and dab it onto my face right before falling asleep. I woke up with great supple skin. THOUGH what I didn t realize what during this month  I had the WORST sleep. It was either trouble falling asleep or waking up at 3am and having trouble getting back to sleep. I thought it s insomnia induced by stress but after countless of supplements I started to think through the environmental factors. My first theory was that this moisturizer was new to my nighttime routine and the sleepless nights started right around the time of purchase. After not using it for a few nights  I slept like a baby. Funny enough the ingredients don t caffeine  at least to my knowledge but now I ve stopped using it.
211,NickiM,1,26-Apr-18,,I have combo skin and in my 40’s... still breakout ! This is the first moisturizer I have been able the wear ! Absolutely NO breakouts! I have been using this Day and night for over a month! So happy! I’m now trying to incorporate The Korean skin care regimen. I also use Seoul Ceutical day glow serum! A miracle in a bottle for sure! Such great products at an affordable price!
212,Rosina,1,11-Dec-17,,Best moisturizer I have ever used. I have acne prone  dry skin and this just absorbs right into my skin and leaves it feeling fresh and just wonderful. I am on my second bottle and I always recommend this product to all of my friends and family. My boyfriend even loves it. Money well spent.
213,Heather Halphen,0,25-Jul-17,2 people found this helpful,It says  oil free  but there are oils listed in the ingredients!! It s so hard to find oil free products and now products are lying. I always check the ingredients. If something says oil free it SHOULD be OIL FREE.
214,Amazon Customer,0,23-Feb-18,2 people found this helpful,Don t be fooled by that  silky  feeling - they are chemical by-products of things like formaldehyde  petroleum  silicone and preservatives that are toxic and can penetrate and actually break down the natural healthy molecules of your skin. Do your research. You wouldn t purposefully eat those things. Don t put them on your skin either!
215,Jazz07ACII,1,21-Apr-17,21 people found this helpful,Probably my favorite affordable moisturizer. I m on my second bottle and I still adore it. The texture is like the love-child of a lotion and a gel  so the lightweight feel of it is addicting even if you don t have oily skin (I m combination/dry). I would not recommend for super dry people  or as a winter moisturizer  but in humid/summer places and for combination/oily people  it s great. It also smells like cola  which might seem weird at first but it becomes quite pleasant and dissipates quickly even if you don t like it.
216,Shelby,1,21-May-17,16 people found this helpful,I was using the Beauty of Josedon cream over the winter but it became too heavy once the weather got warmer. I needed a daytime moisturizer that wouldn t leave me greasy or make my makeup look gross. Being a fan of other Cosrx products  I chose this one and besides being a great price for a lot of product  it works really well with my skin! It absorbs fast and doesn t leave a greasy sheen. It looks good under makeup and I ve had no issue with dry patches later in the day. It also smells light and fresh and I enjoy putting it on. Bonus points for a pump!  Edit: after about 2 weeks I ended up returning it. I was breaking out and after discontinuing use  my skin cleared up. Such a shame because I loved everything else about it!
217,ms1,1,25-Jan-18,4 people found this helpful,Been using this for a few months now and I really  really like this product. As expected  cosrx doesn t let me down. I have oily dehydrated skin so my skin slurps up anything I slap on it with voracity because it needs moisture badly. However  it also goes crazy if I m sensitive to the product - which usually  oil is the culprit of it. This left me at an impasse since a lot of moisturizers contained oil  at least in some form. I use this lotion twice a day  about 5 pumps. 3 pumps first for the whole face + wait 10 minutes + 2 pumps more just for my dry areas. Combined with my other products  I am finally able to wake up with calm skin that isn t stressed from drying out overnight AND oily in my T zone. I will definitely be repurchasing until I find something better.
218,Denise T.,1,30-May-19,One person found this helpful,I ordered this and then got very concerned by  which version  of the product i d get. And then freaked out once i got the one that some reviewers had stated was a  fake  (i.e. the one that says  Formulated with 70.8%..yadda yadda  and no the one that says  Contains...yadda yadda . But  alas  a light went on and I decided to check directly on the Cosrx very much korean website  all with very much korean no translation content  and there it was: the official picture on the official Cosrx website reads  Formulated with 70.8% Birch Sap . So I don t really know if they changed the formula  I will update later on with my experience once i start using the actual product  but in the meantime  I NEEDED to put the debate to rest that the different bottle doesn t mean the product is a fake. It doesn t mean it isn t  either...but the official bottle reads as the one being sold here does. Just in case someone else was panicking  just as I was.
219,Inplainsight,1,06-Dec-17,4 people found this helpful,Loved this product! I bought this after seeing it recommended in a couple of Gothamista s YouTube videos (she is very knowledgeable about K Beauty-check her out!). I have combo skin and get pretty oily in my T-zone. I have also been experiencing a bit of dryness lately which is not common for me  but this product seemed to address all of my skin issues.  The lotion doesn t feel greasy after applied and it absorbs very quickly. It doesn t look shiny when applied and my skin didn t feel like I had anything on even after a couple of layers at night time. It does a good job of controlling oil and moisturized my skin very well. It also has also seemed to help control break outs.  Very impressed with this product and COSRX as a brand. Would recommend and will purchase again!
220,Nancy N.,1,25-Dec-17,3 people found this helpful,This is the perfect winter moisturizer (and perfect any time moisturizer for people with dry skin)!  My skin type is dry to normal. Sometimes I even have random breakouts that pop up out of nowhere. This moisturizer not only keeps my skin s hydration locked in  but it also fights my breakouts. I ve been using this for over a month or so now  and I noticed that whenever I stop using it and I start breaking out a bit  this calms it down within 2 days. I only use this as a night moisturizer or during the day when I don t wear makeup. I think it s not as lightweight to wear under makeup.  It also smells like sprite  so if you hate the smell of that then stay away from this moisturizer lol!  Overall  I love this moisturizer and the hydration it gives me. It lives up to its name :)
221,Sky,1,28-May-19,,Apparently this lotion is a  holy grail  product for many people  so I recently purchased it to see what the hype is about. I ve been using it daily for a couple weeks now  and it s already a  holy grail  item for me!  It has a very light texture that absorbs easily into the skin. The scent is not too strong  and very pleasant?like tea tree  and reminds me of a lighter version of the scent of?COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser. This really is an extremely light lotion  and leaves absolutely no greasy or even soft residue on the skin. It has a more matte finish. My skin is neither particularly dry nor overly greasy  but I think this lotion would be suitable for even greasy skin since it s oil-free.  This product is now an essential part of my daily daytime routine. I use just?COSRX Natural BHA Skin Returning A-Sol?and this lotion before sunscreen  and it is plenty hydrating enough for daytime wear. I do use richer  more emollient products for nighttime  but I ve found that this lotion is perfect for reducing potential shininess in the course of the day?especially in the summer. I honestly don t know what birch sap is meant to do as a skincare ingredient  so I can t speak to that.  I can say that this formula is exactly what I look for in a daytime lotion and has a permanent place in my skincare routine.
222,Kristy Lee,1,05-Feb-18,2 people found this helpful,I have combination/sensitive skin with an oily T zone and it s highly prone to cystic acne. I was frustrated as I kept breaking out for months and I wasn t sure why. I ve heard from other people that it s best to stop using products as it s the best for skin  but that actually made my skin in particular a lot worse. My forehead became flaky though it was oily (a weird sight to see) and cystic acne would always emerge on my forehead or chin (super annoying). I had my doubts with this product since I ve tried other moisturizers that didn t work well on me  but I finally found the right one! It s incredibly lightweight and my skin drinks it up. A little goes a long way which is awesome with this product since it s a pretty sizable bottle. I noticed my skin improved drastically within days  and I ve also learned it s because people with oily skin need a good moisturizer to strengthen it s skin barrier.  I found this moisturizer worked the best with the following products below: ? Innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing 5.5 Cleanser - face wash ? Neogen Real Fresh Cleansing Stick Green Tea - double cleanse. Green tea or tea tree is awesome for sensitive/acne prone skin ? Cure Natural Aqua Gel - exfoliation with a hydrating mask afterwards ? Neogen Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Green Tea 30 pads - exfoliation  I have to say if you re a first time user with this product (or with any product)  test it out on one part of your face before fully committing. Some products that work for some people wouldn t work on others  so definitely test it out to see if your skin reacts well or poorly with it. But if your skin sounds like mine  I would definitely try this out!
223,Amazon Customer,1,19-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,I enjoyed the fact that this moisturizer didn t burn like the Cerave one.  I m not sure if its because I had a sensitivity to the Cerave moisturizer  or even the Neutrogena one  or if I was using too much acne product  but with this lotion  my skin doesn t burn even when using retinol. I recommend it to people who s skin is oily but dried out by acne creams/treatments. The smell is lemony  and it doesn t break me out. The only thing that I could say is that this product works amazingly with the snail mucin cosrx essence. That seems to calm treated and irritated skin down to an amazing level. Hope this helped.
224,bf,1,23-Oct-17,2 people found this helpful,This is a great moisturizer for people who have oily skin. It s so light and cooling on the skin. It s a gel consistency that isn t sticky and doesn t leave any residue so you can t even feel it on your face - definitely makes layering sunscreen and makeup on top of it very easy. My face doesn t feel greasy or oily after a couple hours of wearing this. It does have a scent to it  but I find that most COSRX products do so I m used to it and it doesn t really bother me  plus I think the benefits would outweigh the smell for me anyways.
225,IP,1,18-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,I am a big fan of this brand. I have repurchased their BHA/AHA many times. I am in my late 30 s with oily yet sensitive skin living in the very humid Atlanta  GA. I was searching for a non greasy  moisturizing  pore non clogging  non irritating  oily-combo skin friendly day cream. I know  I know  a lot of asking! I am so glad I found it. This lotion is fantastic. I use BHA/AHA at night (nothing else on the top of it as it s pretty moisturizing itself for my skin and climate)  and I use mandelic acid (different brand) in the morning and this lotion on the top + tinted SPF. My skin feels fantastic. No tightness  no extra oiliness  no inflammation. Thank you COSRX!
226,bbqeen,1,22-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,I have the pleasure of being blessed with oily combation skin and have always struggled with finding a moisturizer that works for me. By mid day my forehead and nose have always been oily and shiny and I had been reduced to going to the bathroom and blotting my face throughout the day. Additionally other oil control moisturizer have left the rest of my face dry. This moisturizer is heaven sent. I can use it on my entire face  cheeks and all  and my skin stays hydrated all day. I dont need to blot my face or reapply it. I even work in a humid environment and found that I do not sweat through it.
227,Em B.,0,15-Oct-18,2 people found this helpful,This is the second time I purchased this product  first time from a different seller. I started the new bottle today and I have a feeling that its NOT THE SAME. My face feels like I m going to have breakouts or an allergic reaction in a few hours. The smell is different  even the text on the bottle looks different... Not happy with this.
228,Teapot,1,21-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,You could power a small town if you set up an oil derrick on my face. This lotion is super light and does nothing for moisturizing  but I use it paired with vitamin c powder and rosewater for a nighttime brightening face serum. It s literally the only thing I ve ever found that I can wear overnight without causing me to get zits. Not a bad value for the price  and no strong fragrance. I like it
229,Jake,1,03-Jun-18,,Perfect light lotion. Soft  sinks in but still quite moisturizing. I ve always had issues with  lotions  making my face feel unbreathable and making me literally hotter in temp than if I didn t wear any. My whole life so I never moisturised because everything I tried until I was 29 gave me these issues. This does not do this  even if it is directly on my top lip  which is where I notice it is more make or break in comfortableness there. This for me is HG. Simple  light  soft lotion with amazing price perfect for even oily skin.
230,Steven,1,28-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,love this stuff. cosrx makes some of the best products out there in my opinion. affordable  huge bottles and effective. i like the smell of this lotion but can see why some wouldn’t. i also need to use a good amount to achieve proper hydration (4-8 pumps morning and night  depending on my skin that day) but the bottle is very large and will last a pretty good amount of time. i haven’t had any clogged pores or break outs since using this
231,Heidi Lee,1,15-Mar-19,,I ve been using this product for 3 years now ever since my friend recommended. It is a decent product. I love almost all COSRX product because it is very soothing and light on your skin. I purchased this for my bf who does not know what skincare product fits him. He s been using for 2 weeks now that he s witnessing changes. He has fewer aches and sebums. I am thinking about getting him COSRX calming pad as well so hopefully  that gives a great synergy! Highly recommended
232,Jesseca Perkins,1,13-Jun-18,,Wow  I have gone through so many different moisturizers. I finally found one that I like. I have sensitive  combination skin. So  finding a moisturizer that works is very complicated. Most moisturizers either leave my face feeling heavy or greasy by the end of the day. However  this moisturizer is very light and does not make my face greasy. I love it. I also love that it feels like it is actually working. I used to use Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel; however  this was too heavy for me and irritated my skin. For the same price and twice the product and quality  you can t go wrong with this!
233,Roger C.,1,18-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,I have decently sensitive skin  but also dry skin. My wife got this for me to use nightly. I put this on my face each night after washing it. I haven’t had any breakout issues  and it helps keep my face from drying out. A couple months of use  and I’ve only used half the bottle so far (using 3 pumps a night).
234,Alyssa,1,08-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,It feels so nice  and makes my skin so soft! I thought it might be too light when the weather is very dry/on the drier parts of my combo skin; even during those days  it keeps my skin feeling very nicely hydrated (plus it doesn t cause the oily parts of my face to get even oilier).  All in all  a standout lotion  and probably a new HG for me.
235,Amazon Customer,1,12-Feb-18,One person found this helpful,Really great product. It has a nice texture and consistency and left my face feeling super hydrated without making my face greasy or oily. I loved how soft my face was after applying this lotion. I have sensitive  acne-prone skin and it ended up breaking me out after about a week so I had to stop using it but it’s still an amazing product. I gave the bottle to my cousin and it didn’t break her out
236,Eve,1,23-May-18,,I really enjoy the light scent it has of the birch tree  some people might not like it  but I also really enjoy tea tree scent so this was wonderful. It is not oil free though so please watch out and read the ingredients. I needed something lightweight for the morning since I m dry all the time from accutane and this fits well for me (though if you re on accutane please be careful because my face isn t so sensitive and this might aggravate your skin because of the oils).
237,xelakitten,1,04-May-19,One person found this helpful,A nice lightweight cream! :) I use this with the hadalabo lotion moist  they work great together. My skin is combination and it feels hydrated finally. I also really like the smell! :)
238,Anna T,1,17-Jun-17,2 people found this helpful,It is alright but i do think you can go wrong with this moisturizer really fast if you use a bit too much. I like that it is oil free and doesn t seem to have a scent but i don t like that it can sometimes feel a bit too heavy and sticky.
239,Anastasia Bulycheva,1,14-Jun-19,,It is very light  scent is a bit strange at first but it disappears after a minute or so. Leaves the skin smooth and soft. Great for day wear when you don t want to put something heavier and let your face shine like a lighthouse (or put a ton of makeup to cover the shine up).
240,Khaleeda Jamal,0,15-Feb-19,,Reviews saying that it s especially good for oily skin convinced me to buy it  so I bought it on a whim without doing research on the ingredients and I was desperately searching for a good moisturizer for oily skin. The texture suggests that it is very hydrating and therefore suitable for oily skin  but it does otherwise. My face became greasier and oilier in less than an hour. It may have been suitable for others with oily skin  but unfortunately not mine.
241,Amazon Customer,1,21-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,I love this moisturizer  as I have oily skin  I do feel like my skin is less oily now -- compared to when I used other moisturizers. Strongly recommend  and I will only be using this moisturizer from now on as a little goes a long way.

243,Vijay Ranganathan,1,24-Jul-17,One person found this helpful,I am an Indian male and my face tends to get very oily in the T-zone. The packaging is excellent and it has a very nice lemon peel fragrance  which is very light and pleasant. I didn t personally think it was very lightweight going on to my skin  but after a few seconds  it does get fully absorbed into your face. After a couple of hours  it does look a wee bit shiny  but a dab from a tissue  sets it right.  Overall am pleased with the product
244,RW,1,28-Apr-18,,This stuff is awesome. I am a huge fan of Cosrx  and this lotion does not disappoint. Having oily skin  I feel that this lotion helps seal in moisture without making me too oily. I do notice that I need to wipe some excess oil off my face in the morning after using it at night  but otherwise its fine. I believe it has helped the overall health of my skin.
245,Cait Y.,1,13-Apr-18,,I appreciate how light the moisturizer is and my skin has reacted well to it so far. My only complaint is that the pump on my bottle came defective and it doesn t pump out any product so I have had to unscrew the top every time I use it. It s just not as sanitary and sometimes too much product comes off and is a waste.
246,Kuji Min,1,03-May-19,,I have oily skin prone to acne  and this has worked for me. I use this with a glycolic acid toner  and my skin texture has been better than it has been in a while. It feels a little greasy at first  but my skin absorbs it pretty well and stays moisturized

It does smell  but its almost unnoticeable.
249,Lisameeks74,1,15-Apr-19,,This is a really good lotion  facial cream for my oily skin. I like it alot. I have noticed that with using this my face feels and looks less oily. It does not clog my pores. No harsh scent and it is not thick and greasy.

252,Gabriela,1,21-Jun-18,,I have used two entire bottles of this lotion  it s really great. Gentle on the skin and light enough that it will do well if you have several steps in your skincare routine. This has turned into my morning moisturizer though  as I switched to something more powerful for night time.
253,S. Goods,1,27-May-19,,This lotion pairs really nicely with their facial cleanser. Nothing to write home about though. I ll probably let my husband use. Seems more like a man s lotion.
254,Crystal Tapp,1,30-Oct-17,One person found this helpful,This lotion is refreshing and moisturizing. It s a light lotion but it does moisturize. The light scent of tea tree and botanicals makes me feel like I m assisting my acne-prone skin when I moisturize rather than clogging it.
255,A Hewitt,1,17-Mar-18,,I have really dry skin and nothing I’ve tried has been able to help with the dryness and not cause me to break out. So when I ordered this I wasn’t expecting much but after I tried it I was so impressed. I couldn’t believe how hydrated my skin felt AND it’s never made me break out. It’s now a product that I use everyday and I’ll definitely be repurchasing this moisturizer very soon.
256,Kate,1,20-Dec-18,,Very soft and smooth lotion  have no rush from it what so ever. Great cosmetic line  especially this particular item. I love lotions without any smells- this one works for me- has almost no smell. Very satisfied.
257,MrsLove,1,27-May-18,,Bought this for my teens with acne  works great especially with the rest of the system  wash and toner. I actually use this as my day routine now. 100% will repurchase  it’s a game changer!
258,TSW,1,02-Jun-19,,My favorite moisturizer all year round. Cosrx is a great Korean skin care brand and they really consider skin to ensure a great product!

260,Brandon Zeman,1,18-Jun-19,,I love this. It is absolutely fantastic. Great value too give the large bottle size. I use it with the toner and skin feels great.
261,tanstaafl,1,05-Dec-18,,Almost all face products cause me irritation and this doesn’t! It feels great. Works well under makeup. Doesn’t make me cry if I get it in my eye.
262,Divyana,1,16-May-18,,My all time favorite moisturizer. I love the feel on my skin. It leaves my skin dewy but not sticky. I have never broken out or been irritated while using this product. It had no strong scents. Perfect for my combo skin.

264,P. Posey,1,02-Feb-18,,I use it as my moisturizer. After applying all my products  regular lotion was leaving my skin feeling heavy and greasy. This stuff hydrates without any of that. I have combination skin--dry cheeks and oily T/U zone.
265,tdjones,1,15-Oct-18,,The best moisturizer I ve ever come across. Skin feels soft but never oily. A true light weight moisturizer. Scent is pleasant and light. I have combination skin and felt it balanced it out.
266,Sangwoo,1,15-Jul-17,,Ya know  for me  it didn t quite work out too well. I feel my skin is very sensitive and it kind of irritated it. I am sad as I had high hopes  but my husband uses it and it s perfect for his oily/acne prone skin!
267,joshua/yakelin forward,1,26-Dec-18,,This is my favorite face moisturizer. This is a lightweight yet refreshing and deep moisturizing formula. I use this day and night. This also lasts me a long time even though I use 2-3 pumps per use. I pair it with the cosrx snail serum in a similar bottle at night and its the perfect hydration!
268,Dlea,1,16-Oct-16,One person found this helpful,I love this lightweight lotion! I have combination acne prone skin and this lotion is perfect hydration without causing further breakouts. I really love the birch smell too
269,Jenny,1,04-Sep-17,,This product is amazing! It provides the perfect amount of moisture without having that lotion-y feel afterwards. It made my skin very smooth and didn t cause me to break out like a lot of other products have. Definitely will be buying this again and again!
270,George Zaragoza,1,06-May-17,,Falling in love with the cosrx line! A little goes a long way  it spreads so smooth and silky. Sanitary pump dispenser  oil free and fragrance free. My skin is 10x smoother  I cant stop grazing over my face!! Which is probably bad but oh well!!!!
271,Amazon Customer,1,20-Sep-17,,My new holy grail daytime moisturizer. I have suuuper oily skin and I just love this stuff. Use a tiny bead of this and it goes far. Smoothed out great. Isn t greasy at all. Makeup goes on nice over this. Will repurchase.

273,Emily,0,03-Jun-17,4 people found this helpful,My skin has been clear for a year now  but I don t use a moisturizer so I thought I would give this a try. I wanted to like this so much but it broke me out bad. (Note to self: do not try new products before a special event like one s birthday unless you enjoy walking around with red spots all over your face). The upside it is does moisturize well  but it didn t sink into my skin. Another thing is the very strong smell of tea tree. I love that smell but this product smelled so strong it made me nauseous. The hunt for a moisturizer that doesn t break me out continues...

278,Maja Miletich,1,08-Sep-17,,I was struggling with a damaged lipid barrier and my skin was very sensitive and breaking out like crazy. This really helped to soothe and calm my skin while adding hydration back into my face! My skin is very happy  and I think this is a great deal for the amount of product you get for the price.
279,Sydney,1,17-May-18,,I ve used it for a few weeks and stop. It s hydrating and smooth on skin.
280,Amy,1,07-Jul-17,,Lots for the price  is very hydrating but not greasy  sinks in well and doesn t make my combo/oily skin more oily. Overall pretty good at balancing out my skin. I am trying to figure out if it is causing mild acne for me  hence the 4 stars instead of 5.

291,Alia Bailey,1,23-Jul-17,,I loved this moisturizer because of its light consistency. I have oily/combo skin and I was worried about clogging my pores. I think it might be too light for dry skin but who knows? Under all those other products it might fit in perfectly.

294,Marvelin,0,14-Oct-17,5 people found this helpful,I was excited to try this after reading all the great reviews. This has a weird smell to it  not too strong so it didn t bother me too much  but it did sting a little bit when I applied it. My skin felt so dry  even after applying two layers of it. I developed dry patches after two days of using this. For the record  I have combination skin & not too much acne  but not clear skinned either.

299,Laura,1,07-Nov-17,,Very lightweight. Might need a little more oomph for winter
300,zara,1,29-Jul-17,,For someone with oily  acne prone skin this moisturizer not only remains light on the skin but allows me to wake up the next morning without that  shine  on my face that I get from other moisterizers. Plus the texture reminds me or Est?e Lauder s pore refining lotion!

306,M. Philipp,1,15-Nov-17,,I use this product after my snail mucin and I love it! It makes me feel moisturized without looking oily  I must disagree with everyone on the smell though. My mom and I both think it smells exactly to a T like Cola Gummies.
307,Zaina,0,03-Mar-18,,Not for acne prone skin  it breaks me out. I have oily skin and needed a good oil free moisturizer  I wouldn t recommend this. It might be good for dry skin or clear skin.

316,Marta,1,17-Jul-16,8 people found this helpful,Finally a face moisturizer I love! It s so light weight (almost a gel texture instead of a cream) and yet the most moisturizing face product I ever tried. I ve always had a difficult time finding the right moisturizer for my combo/oily skin. Most light weight lotions didn t provide enough moisture and left my skin dry  red and irritated. Using creams just clogged pores and left my skin greasy (most of them didn t even absorb enough to provide any kind of moisture). I use this lotion every morning AND night - it replaced my night cream. And I think it will be moisturizing enough for the fall/winter season too. It s also perfect to wear under makeup because it absorbs so quickly and doesn t leave any residue on your skin. However  it doesn t contain any SPF  so you would need to use a different product on top of this moisturizer for daytime. I have oily/combo skin  however I think this would suit all skin type and would work great for dryer skin types during summer/humid months. I can t believe this is such a quality product for such a great price. If you re still unsure about purchasing this  then I definitely urge you to try it!
317,Jennifer Prueser,1,21-Mar-18,,Light weight  absorbs quickly  moisturizing  and great for oily skin. I will definitely repurchase!
318,lake n,1,21-Mar-18,,Love putting this on for my morning routine  loved it soo much had to buy again
319,Patrick,1,03-Apr-17,,This is a must-Have! I have oily skin and this works really well for me. It is to be used BEFORE a moisturizer it isn t a moisturizer itself  but it makes your moisturizer so much more effective my skin has become so soft and smooth. I highly recommend.

I have normal skin and despite being oil-free  this moisturizer moisturizes so so so well. I texted it on the back of my hand and it made the untested hand look super ashy ??. This is definitely a great product ESPECIALLY if your face felt/feels dry (like mine) after AHA/BHA treatments
323,Angela,0,09-Feb-18,,Made me break out in tiny itchy hives on my cheeks and neck. 1 star for the no return policy.

I prefer to use as my AM moisturizer  but paired with a night cream  your skin looks great in the morning. A must have if you work or go to school and don t have time to sit around and wait for your moisturizer to absorb before adding on your sunscreen.

349,Amazon Customer,1,06-Jun-17,,great moisturizer for my oily skin
350,KKN,1,28-Nov-17,,This is one of my favorite daytime moisturizers. Actually  the word  lotion  is a bit misleading due to translation (in Korean  lotion is the word that is used for like a pre-moisturizer) so this product is supposed to be used before the moisturizer (more like a serum)  but I find it hydrating enough to use alone during the day. I have oily skin  so I was really excited to find this as it does not feel heavy or sticky on my face at all  even on drier days I ve found that it layers with other products quite nicely.
351,Connie Halliday,1,21-Sep-16,,Nice product.
352,Divina G. Perez,1,23-Jul-16,,I love the fresh smell and how light it feels.
353,Carmela,1,13-Sep-16,6 people found this helpful,I LOVE this moisturizer. I ve switched from expensive Sephora/boutique brands to Korean skin care after realizing how much better they work despite being more inexpensive (granted  Sephora does carry some high-end Korean products now but I haven t tried them since I just research online and purchase from Amazon now)  and this moisturizer is my favorite  even among several Korean brands that I tried. I m an adult with mostly oily skin and occasional hormonal acne  and pimple scars on my cheeks. I ve been using this product every morning and evening after cleansing and toning  and after a couple of weeks my skin is softer and looks and feels smoother - even my pimple scars and pores look less noticeable. It does have an herbal (tea tree oil) scent but I ve grown to like it and it goes away quickly. I like the convenience of the pump too  as it helps control the amount of product dispensed (as a previous reviewer noted  a little bit goes a long way). I will definitely repurchase!
354,mmoua,1,21-Jan-17,,My FAVORITE moisturizer of all times. So gentle and keeps my face so soft and hydrated. I love the subtle smell of it as well. I can t stop using it. I have converted my husband to start using it also. He woke up the morning after and couldn t believe how soft his face was. Haha. He is now using Cosrx products with me.

356,Bryana Muro,1,17-Oct-16,,New HG product. Please COSRX  never stop making this.  I use this in the morning before sunscreen  after vitC and serums. I have oily skin but also live in a very dry climate  so on some days I seal it in with Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream for extra  non-sticky moisture.
357,Amazon Customer,1,12-Jan-17,,Cosrx knocks it out of the park yet again.  I absolutely love how light yet moisturizing this is  and is perfect for people such as myself that have oily skin. The birch sap scent is SO soothing and fresh- this has definitely become my go-to moisturizer when I m not using a cream at night (it also can be used before a cream  too  for even more moisturization).  Definitely recommend trying this! :)
358,Meresankh,1,06-Apr-17,2 people found this helpful,Usually  having the words  oil free  and  Ultra Moisturizing  in the same sentence is a set-up for contradiction. In the case of Cosrx s Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion  it s not. The key ingredient is birch sap. There s been a few products on the Korean skincare market lately that tout tree sap as the main ingredient for long-lasting moisture. I use two pumps of this lotion near the end of my morning Asian beauty regimen  and that s enough to cover my face  neck  and chest. It s ultra-light  definitely does not feel greasy or oily (it s oil free  duh!)  and does not irritate my skin at all. It has a scent that reminds me of 7-Up. (Yes  it smells like a soft drink to me.) I kinda like that. What I really like about this stuff is that it makes my mature  oily skin feel nicely moisturized  not greasy  heavy  or weighed down. This lotion plays well with other products and is perfect for layering. When I get near the end of this bottle  I will definitely be re-ordering!
359,W. Rose,1,11-Dec-17,,LOVE the smell of this stuff. I think it must be the tea tree that I smell (sooo  its technically not oil free with that ingredient  but I ll give it a pass because tea tree oil is awesome). It absorbs quickly. I m not totally blown away by the results or anything  but I like the smell  and I like that it can layer well under heavier lotions or creams.
360,Misha Kollontai,1,03-Jan-18,,Best moisturizer I have ever used. Non-greasy  absorbs well  smells pleasant  and I think it s helped tame my (adult  hormonal) acne.
361,idreamincolor,1,04-Nov-17,,A good moisturizer for oily skin. I can only use it in the summer. its not as hydrating as i thought
362,E.C/Y.C,1,15-Dec-16,,I love it! Very good to use under make up. Not too light but not too heavy either!
363,TO,1,08-Apr-16,22 people found this helpful,Nice  light lotiony moisturizer with a pleasant fresh bright scent from the birch sap. My skin is highly reactive to humidity (so on dry days I peel  on warm humid days I get oily & break out). For me  using this on dry days is a no-go (dead of winter is right out)...BUT  I have found that this moisturizer in conjunction with Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream (the Cosrx first  then Mizon as a final layer) helps seal in all the goodness and get the job done for days that aren t super-dry and for normal  climate-controlled office days. The formula is non-irritating and causes tender  broken-out skin to feel hydrated and as though it is repairing itself. This product has endeared itself to me as an indispensable warm-weather moisturizer. 5/5  this is on my permanent re-buy list.

367,Viva D,0,02-Jun-18,,This WAS a great light when it worked properly. It is sturdy when clipped on the music stand and stayed put wherever we placed it. There was ample lighting to illuminate music scores on the stand. Less than 4 months later  the brightest setting doesn t work anymore. It is now consistently shining out very poor dim light regardless of what setting it s switched on to. It has become totally useless. A very disappointing product from kootek.
368,Dreamer81,1,17-Mar-19,,I heard of this product from a skincare guru. I have acne prone skin and this worked well with my skin. I don’t think my skin was incredible softer or hydrated after every use  but it felt okay. It did not make my skin break out and did its job. Overall  a good mosturizer.

379,Susana Rodriguez,1,22-Oct-16,625 people found this helpful,If you are doubting this product  stop what you are doing and run to your nearest Walgreens  Target  or Wal-Mart and pick this product up. It WILL change your life. I had SEVERE eczema on my face and it was incredibly painful. I had red  inflamed  itchy  flaky  and disgusting skin. I tried everything  from organic to high priced Macy s products. Nothing worked  until I picked up a $2 sample of this at Walgreens after reading the reviews online. Well  it is a miracle product. My face feels amazing  I use it twice daily  and my eczema is at 0%-I ve had no recurrence. I have my life back and I am just spreading the love. It has also diminished my acne breakouts by 98%. I can t tell you enough  just try it! I hope it does for you  what it has done for me. I also want to add  I didn t get anything for free or was asked to do this review  I just honestly needed to share my experience.
380,Laura K.,1,30-Apr-18,117 people found this helpful,I have extremely dry skin that s also acne prone and sensitive. That s a tough combination to treat because most products that heavily moisturizer also cause acne. This lotion is by far the best I ve used! I can slather it on as much as I want without any irritation or acne and it soaks right in and soothes my dry skin. I m a lifetime customer for sure

My skin is actually brighter & it stays hydrated all day wo drying out ! I m 66 & this is a winner for me having tried so many over the years ---plus this one has important skin nutrient ingredients at a fantastic price! Thank you Amazon too !

We have to have her on Benadryl constantly because she ll claw herself until she bleeds. We tried everything and eventually the doctor pointed us to CerVe instead of Cetaphil. The cream does an amazing job. We have to give my daughter a bath every night and it goes on right after. It s thick but it doesn t weigh down like a lot of creams. We rub it in until you see a little bit of white still left and then put her in long pj s to give the most moisturizing capabilities. This stuff as allowed my kid to be a kid. She rarely screams anymore when we have to put this one because it takes care of the itching so she isn t breaking skin. Honestly this stuff is amazing.
383,BCB,1,07-Apr-18,88 people found this helpful,Let me set the scene that is my 35 year old face...still enjoying breakouts and blackheads  wrinkles  nose skin that regularly fully peels off  neck skin that’s starting to get that waddle/wrinkly look. Yeah  awesome. Tried this and am loving it. I gave it 5 stars but it’s not perfect  but what could with all my  things . The only issue I’ve had was some pore clogging at the beginning  but my skin has mostly gotten used to this thick layer of moisture. My nose gets some dry patches  but they’re truly just a patch instead of the whole thing. Skin looks plumper and livelier. My neck waddle will be my friend for the rest of my days  but the skin looks much less wavy/dry. Overall I’m extremely pleased with the results.
384,Mounir Errami,1,04-Jan-19,58 people found this helpful,I am a doctor. Not a dermatologist though. In our world when it comes to derm issue we have a saying:  if the skin is too wet  then dry it; if it is too dry then wet it; if this doesn t work  then use steroids! . I have struggled with a dry skin for a long time and have used a lot of different emollients and moisturizing creams. My face was often red  and would peel off. I really though I had some autoimmune condition  and tried a course of steroids. I tried this cream  and did wonders for me (FYI  I don t own stocks in the company and do not benefit in any way from writing this review!).
385,handicapped shopper,1,30-May-18,50 people found this helpful,I love this cream. I put in on a dry facecloth after my shower to get it all over my body  and to trap the moisture of the shower. The face cloth picks up the excess moisture from my skin as it puts a layer of moistizer over the skin. It works very well. I was getting some very dry spots on my aged skin and I looked for something to help. I did a lot of reading  and settled on CeraVe. I haven t been disappointed.

Seriously  I haven t itched since  amazing  and not too much impresses me. Nor do I write many reviews. I now use it on my face  ears  elbows and feet. And if you wanted to compliment me on my legs  thanks  I know I ve got good looking ones LOL. FYI it comes in a nice 19 Oz size  plenty without worrying about running out soon.
389,Amazon Customer,0,20-Dec-17,33 people found this helpful,Didnt suit me at all  made me break out badly (im using it as a foot cream now!) I have sensitive and very dry skin  currently with just a few acne here and there. I thought this should be one of the safest moisturizers for me to try but it turned out not useful for me. Also  it doesnt absorb in my skin at all and if i rub it much it feels very rubbery  yet just sits on my skin. Going by the rave reviews  i believe i m one of the very few this product suit  but since you could also be  one of the few   I suggest everyone trying this product to get a smaller packaging or sample first.
390,Amazon Customer2,1,09-Jun-18,24 people found this helpful,LOVE this cream. It s scentless  and really thick. HOWEVER  it sinks into your skin so fast that after just a few minutes your face doesn t have that greasy lotion feel so even during the day it doesn t feel heavy. It does a great job at moisturizing. I used this on my hands once after weeks of chronic dryness and it was left feeling really soft even the day after. My only tripe is there is no seal (inside or out) which makes me nervous because I feel like theres a chance people could just open it and contaminate it before it ever reaches you. They should really fix that.
391,sb-lynn,1,11-Nov-17,21 people found this helpful,I have always had sensitive skin and even more so once I developed an autoimmune disease. My illness has really wrecked havoc on my skin  especially my hands and I have to make sure they are moisterized  protected and in good shape.  I had been using Cetaphil for years but my doctors at UCLA recommended CeraVe lotions and soaps and I have really become a fan. This moisterizing cream is terrific - the texture is thick but blends in and it really keeps my skin feeling soft and moisterized for a long time. That is especially important during the winter months.  Highly recommended. I recommend all of their products. I usually don’t like bar soaps but I tried (and reviewed ) theirs recently and now that’s what I use. Just a terrific line of products for your skin.
392,Sarah H,0,21-Dec-18,18 people found this helpful,DO NOT put this product on your face. I have very sensitive skin and rosacea. After reading a lot of good reviews  I decided to try this product. It made my skin break out horribly and become inflamed. I regret ever using this on my face. Weeks later after I stopped using it and my skin is just now starting to clear up from this product. Awful!
393,Liam A.,0,14-Jan-19,15 people found this helpful,I really hate to give this product such a low rating. I ve been using this product for a week now and bought it because of all the spectacular reviews. I put it on every night before bed. I always feel a burning sensation but I still continue applying it (I figured it was normal). After doing this for a week  I notice that my eczema has increased rather than decreased and I don t see any skin differences that I was hoping for. I m still considering trying it again or just dumping it :/
394,Human Library,1,30-Oct-18,14 people found this helpful,I saw the comparisons to Cetaphil and was a minute away from purchasing it. But I carefully read CeraVe s ingredients and they are superior to Cetaphil. Some said CeraVe feels like nothing on the skin. I put some on my hands and initially felt the same way. I exfoliate with exfoliating gloves daily in the shower. I used CeraVe afterwards and my skin was soooo moist! Exfoliating is key  at least for immediate results. Your skin may feel the same  but only after some time with consistent use. The label says it delivers moisture over time  but I had great results after exfoliating. Try it that way.
395,consumer21,1,04-Apr-18,18 people found this helpful,This moisturizing cream is the real deal. What I like best is how quickly this is to dry. Less than 5 minutes and this product feels like it has penetrated your skin. It doesn t leave that oily feeling just about every other lotion type product leaves. To add on to that  it works amazingly well  I work outside and my hands and face take some punishment. This cream protects my hands in the morning and dries rapidly  I use it at night on my face and hands as well. I can t expand on that it is a quality lotion/cream that works.
396,J. Marriott,1,14-Feb-19,11 people found this helpful,I’m blown away by the lotions in this brand. This cream is wonderful right now  I’m up in NE Illinois  and it’s cold and dry. My body skin normally feels just as dry as the weather  but not since I’ve been using CeraVe. Disclaimer: I bought the daily moisture lotion first  in January  and that  along with Neutrogena bar soap (no SLS!!!! Yay!!!) has transformed the way my skin feels. This cream is even more moisturizing. I wish I’d known about this brand years ago  the gods only know how much money I’ve spent on lotions that never worked. When CeraVe says 24-hour moisture  they mean it. It works  and it works well. Softest  smoothest skin I’ve ever had. Even my feet are happy! Love  and highly recommend.
397,Jessica Call,1,07-Nov-18,11 people found this helpful,After researching various skin lotions  this seems to be the REAL DEAL! The ingredients  ceramides and hyaluronic acid  other emollients work as described. Best to apply any skin cream product after showering to maximize moisturizing barrier. I cannot give a more superlative review of a skin care lotion. My dry itchy skin has found relief after one application. I m so glad I bought the 19 0z size....And made in the USA. Approved for people with certain skin disorders  e.g. eczema. Buying the large size with Prime was well worth it. And non -comedogenic. This is a keeper. Thank you.
398,Rachel,1,24-Aug-17,16 people found this helpful,I am 21 years old and this is the BEST I have ever used. I had always heard about it and seen it but I saw this girl with amazing skin and asked what she used and she said  I ve been using CeraVe for 2 years  so naturally I bought it. Literally life changing. I have had red spots on my face for a long time and discoloration and I feel as though even only after using this for a week or so- they are fading. The texture and how quickly it dries on your face is just EVEN MORE amazing. BUY THIS STUFF YALL.
399,Jess Silva,1,22-Oct-17,14 people found this helpful,I just want to start off with a history of problems that I have had with past moisturizers. So I have combination skin (both oily & dry). I produce oil only in my T zone. I used to hate using moisturizer on my face only because the moisturizers that I used never helped me such as Aveeno  Simple  and Clinique(not trying to bash these products just lending a helping hand if anyone else has had similar problems as me). They all left my face feeling and looking greasy and even broke me out. I have no explanation why but what I have concluded is I have extremely sensitive skin. For the longest time I never used moisturizer but my skin definitely craved moisture especially because I use makeup and African black soap; both are very drying to the skin which is not bad but there needs to be balance. These past two years I’ve noticed more prominant wrinkles and my skin just degrading over time (keep in mind I’m only 18) and my acne just wasn’t getting any better. If anything  drying out your skin causes more acne because your face has to reproduce all the natural oils stripped from the skin which means over production of oil. I looked online and found this cream. I was hesitant at first because I didn’t want to be disappointed and I didn’t want to have to end up going to a dermatologist to figure out a moisturizer that could work for me. I went along with the purchase and I kid you not  within the first 3 days of using this product my face has never felt smoother and looked healthier in my entire life. It makes me joyful because I thought I just wouldn’t be able to find one. This moisturizer is not greasy. It’s a heavy cream but goes on the skin lightly and is soaked in quickly ( at least for my since it has needed it for far too long). I’m not a professional at all but I prefer to use this product at night after I have washed my face properly only because I feel my skin has a more gradual time to soak the product in nicely. Then in the morning I just simply splash some cold water on my face  pat dry  and apply my makeup. As I said  I am not a professional so dont feel the need to follow what I do but this product has definitely worked very well with my skin type and I will definitely be sticking to this brand.
400,kami,1,15-Dec-18,11 people found this helpful,I LOVE this product. I was extremely scared to order it because I m picky and fickle with my skincare. I have combination skin which is very sensitive and acne prone. It works amazing; I only apply once a day  the moisture it gives me lasts sooo long. It doesn t break me out and feels soft  velvety and absorbs quick. I had dry patches from using acne medication and this healed them in 3 days  which I wasn t able to do with any other moisturizer. If you overapply  you can get a little oily; I woke up with some shine on my T zone the first day I used it - so oily skinned individuals bare in mind. Bonus: the container is HUGE (a real bang for your buck) and a little goes a long way - so use only A TINY bit spread along your whole face evenly. Yet to use it on my body  but my face is handling it really well.

402,Allen,1,27-Jul-18,12 people found this helpful,This is easily the best moisturizer I have used. I have tried a dozen different moisturizers in my life and so far this one is the best. It is thick  so you aren t required to use a bunch of it to cover your face. My skin no longer feels tight or still dry after using it  and it doesn t leave my face oily or greasy. It has no scent which is nice for people with sensitive skin and the price for the volume they give you is just a steal.  Will continue buying!
403,Emily Thompson,0,22-Jan-18,16 people found this helpful,The cream is a lot thicker than I was expecting. It says  Daily Face and Body Moisturizer  but I would not use this on my face - two nights of using this product and my acne has worsened significantly.
404,sserif,1,15-Feb-19,6 people found this helpful,During winter my skin became extremely dry due to the lack of humidity. Living in the desert region  my problems were severely exacerbated. The itching and dryness was quite serious to the point that it made me conscious and this was constantly on my mind. Tried various natural remedies like coconut  olive  almond oil mixes as well as aloe vera. The fresh aloe did work but was a hassle to acquire a steady supply every day. On reading the reviews decided to give this a shot and this brand is really the dark horse of moisturizing products. It definitely does not have the hype of other well known brands buy when it comes to bringing your skin back to its natural balance there is no other that can match this. It adds a small glow to my face and my husband always queries gently as to what I have on. It gradually mattes down and gets my face into its natural even state. Some reviews have mentioned that this works even if you have dry patches on normal/oily skin as well ...  The key thing about this product is the cool price. Not very expensive. The ample supply should easily last through the winter.. Very Very happy that there is an off-the-shelf product that can cure my annoying dry patches...
405,Elizabeth R,1,29-Dec-18,8 people found this helpful,My dermatologist suggested I try this product for my VERY DRY skin. I works very well and I only have to apply it once a day.

407,lgndavison,0,11-Apr-19,5 people found this helpful,Let me start by saying it s pretty rare for me to have acne. I might have one or two pimples on my face a month  and it s usually during a stressful work week. I have chronic dry skin on my face from acne medication when I was younger so I use a daily lotion on my face. I have been using Olay to meet this need for almost two years  but sometimes on a high wind day or during winter months the moisturizing benefits didn t last a full day.  At first opening of the product  it has a pleasant smell and appears very thick. Nevertheless  based on the reviews  I went ahead and applied a small amount to my hand then face. It felt somewhat oily when I applied it. By the end of the work day  my temples  nose  and upper cheeks were unusually oily. The next day I had a pimple. I wanted to like the product and I thought it may be just my body getting used to something new so I used it for two more days. By the fourth morning  I had a full on breakout of unsightly acne in multiple locations on my face and I haven t used it since.  If you re prone to acne or have large pores  I d think twice before using this product.
408,Amazon Customer,0,03-Mar-19,7 people found this helpful,I purchased his moisturizer after frequently using CeraVe’s face cleansing foam and wanting to try a new moisturizer. I had been spending several months trying to get a breakout under control and was making a lot of progress  but my old moisturizer felt like it wasn’t quite doing the job. One night of use and all the progress I had made at getting my breakout under control was completely erased. The next morning  I woke up with small pimples over every area. What users are saying about the stickiness of the product is also true - your face feels like duct tape after putting this lotion on. This product caused such a bad reaction that I’m going to have to spend several hundred dollars to go to a dermatologist to see what this garbage has done to me.

I bought two  and will continue to buy these.  Not only have they helped stop the itching  but my redness is going away! And it feels good on your hands too  but washes off so easily too. Great quality product.  I use to use Ucerine  but am now a true believer in CeraVe!
411,Anados Defered,1,05-Apr-19,4 people found this helpful,I have had issues with my skin as long as I can remember. Being allergic to almost everything. Developing eczema at the drop of a hat. From stress alone. Dry  red  irritated skin which became damaged  slow to heal. Those vesicles that break. Dermatographic skin that gets red raised  swollen with mild pressure. I learned about the role of hydration. Increasing fluids. Increasing beneficial fats like avocados. Fatty fish. Broccoli. Adequate Vitamin C and E. Calcium. Like everything else  diet  vitamins  supplements are necessary but not sufficient. Environmental factors  heat  prolonged sunlight  pollution - even animal dander  harsh soaps  - all encountered in everyday normal life still compromised my skin integrity. Made my skin lose their natural oils. I have tried skin oils  lotions. Some I still use - and love. But. They do not have the same restorative qualities. Nor the same action. As CeraVe. Our skin epidermis - the outer layer - is made up of phospholipids. The ceramides in CeraVe restore those lipids. Restore our skins integrity as a natural barrier. But that is not why I love CeraVe. It lives up to all its claims - and more. Non-allergenic. Soothing. No fragrance to annoy me. Or others. It never feels greasy. It is as if I can feel that moisture - that healing - the minute I put some on my skin. The hyaluronic acid helps retain that moisture - helps the skin regain that full fresh glow & appearance of health. With repeated application  over days  it helps my skin heal. My eczema is still there. That sensitivity  remains. But with that repeated application - even 2 or 3 times daily for a few days. My skin is soothed. The sensitivity reduced. Condition controlled. But it is a joy to control because the application feels so darn good. It dries quickly. Never feels like there is something pulling or shrinking on top of my skin. It goes into the skin. Does not sit on top. My friend who also has issues with her dry skin recommended this. It is the single best over the counter skin moisturizing and restorative product I have ever used. I cannot say enough good things about this.

The first was my husband s Doctor  after using aquaphor on his skin graft and graft site  we switched to cerave which his skin was much better at absorbing.  The other was my allergist. After giving birth to my son I had a series of rashes all over my body for 2 months. Visits to both my OBGYN and dermatologist were useless. In desperation I turned to an allergist who recommended this product as it helps your skin membrane repair itself  in his words. Within a week my rashes were completely gone and I was able to sleep again!! I will never use another lotion.

I can t even wear foundation or powder because it will make the flaky texture more obvious... Anyway  out of pure desperation and tired of spending money on scrubs and moisturizers  I purchased it and started using this a few days ago. It has kept me flake free! It doesn t leave a greasy film  it sinks right into my skin. I even wore it with makeup today and my skin was smooth and flake free. My makeup stayed nice all day. I wish I had tried that sooner  I have the same problem every winter! I apply it from head to toe. It s awesome and you get so much product for the money.

416,Amber,1,04-Jun-19,3 people found this helpful,there are 2 before and 2 after photos. I had started a new acne medicine and it was causing me so much texture and redness and overall drying my face out so I read the reviews and bought this. These photos were taken about a month apart  using this moisturizer 2-3 times a week  I find that I do not need to use it as often as a daily moisturizer  only when I am doing heavy exfoliants or after deep cleansing my skin. as you can see the texture is gone and the redness has gone down drastically  my face is no longer itchy and craving moisture. it is very thick so use sparingly. it is a very large container of it so it will last a long time! there is no scent and has not broken my skin out at all. it soothes my face  and will sink into your skin but no so much that your pores are clogged. no oily residue left on the skin once it absorbs either. I have incredibly sensitive skin as well and this has NEVER caused me any problems  only solved them

We used Aquaphor when he was a baby (recommended by his pediatrician)  but during summer  Aquaphor was too thick and greasy. Around that summer (after enduring those thick Aquaphor for two months)  we found a brilliant and friendly dermatologist  and she recommended CeraVe instead of Aquaphor. And after a few months of CeraVe  his eczema has been completely gone! Now he has been eczema free for 3½ years  but we still use this every day. It s even okay during winter days (live in New England area...)
419,Amazon Customer,1,26-May-17,8 people found this helpful,I originally purchased this product at my dermatologist s office  but now I get it from Amazon due to the better price. I have extremely dry hands  a condition that is exacerbated by hand-washing (which I do frequently) and getting my hands wet from other things like cleaning  etc. Last Fall I hit  rock bottom  - my skin was chapped  blistering  bleeding  and I experienced horrible pain whenever I did anything with my hands. After trying several  miracle  creams that were highly recommended by others (but did nothing or made my problem worse)  I finally went to the dermatologist in desperation.  My doctor recommended that I use the CeraVe cream  along with a prescription topical steroid (due to how bad my skin was at the time). For me  this really was  the stuff ... it took a couple of weeks  but my hands completely cleared up and looked totally smooth and normal again. I still use the CeraVe by itself every night before bed (with cotton gloves to avoid getting it everywhere)  and my hands have never gotten as dry as they were before I started using the cream. No strong scent either  which is also a plus for me.
420,Den Se,1,06-May-17,8 people found this helpful,I rarely write reviews. That being said winter was hard on my skin this year. I m 32 and inherited my mom s dry skin. I thought Spring would help but my skin had gotten worse. Dry scaley leg skin that was embarassing and becoming painful even using another lotion (with a scent I could not stand). I googled around researching the best unscented lotion for my situation. A lot of posts recommended this kind of cereve but specifically cautioned against getting the kind with the pump. I ve been using for a week or two combined with a sugar scrub once a week. The difference is amazing. I m mad at myself I didn t buy/try this sooner. Before this my skin was literally painful. Highly recommend this product.

I used Cetaphil for years but in the last few years it really wasn t working as well and my skin seemed to still be irritated and break out often. I went back to the doctor and they suggest I try CeraVe. It s more expensive but it works wonders! It goes on smooth and leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated. It keeps my skin soft all day. With continued use  I see improvements in my skin and far less irritation and breaking out. I don t have to use my steriod cream as much since this lotion keeps my skin calm and clear. I use it for my body and face. I made the mistake of trying to save money once and buying a  store brand  alternative and regretted it. Spend the extra money to get this wonderful line of products.

One container I added a Prescription of something and the other to use as the 2nd application of 3 during a 24 hour period. After following her instructions  a week went by I began to notice the pain and itching subside. Also every hair follicle that was red and inflammed was slowly fading. After trying many different things this stuff is working on getting my skin back to health. I am very thankful that I found it and hope it helps others as well.
424,Peg,1,28-Aug-18,5 people found this helpful,I would never be without this fabulous  moisturizing cream! My dermatologist recommended Cera Ve cream a number of years ago and I sweat by it. You can use it all over your body  including your face! There is no scent just lots of moisture that goes deep into your pores and hydrates better than any cream I have ever used!
425,AbsAbsAbs007,0,06-Nov-18,4 people found this helpful,Guys  I am so bummed this didnt work for my face. The first few days my skin was GLOWING. But since  OMG worst acne I have ever had. HUGE  painful breakouts. I am so bummed. I m rating two stars because it still is good for body use. Very moisturizing. If you re sensitive to acne- be wary! It must work well for some  but for me- good gracious I am mortified to be at work right now with this acne :(
426,chrystian perez,1,17-Jan-19,3 people found this helpful,This product is very hydrating. I use it after exfoliating my face. It does sting a bit in areas that may have been over exfoliated. It does not feel greasy which is a major plus. It absorbs into the skin rather quickly. I can already tell it is going to last me a very long time as a little goes a long way for me. I read reviews that claim it helped the appearance of breakouts and helped to clear their skin  I have not experienced that for myself. It may just be too soon for me to see a difference. All in all I like this cream and recommend.
427,Susanna L. Wells,1,23-Jun-19,One person found this helpful,I ve had difficult skin from birth with dryness  eczema  and just plain sensitivity & allergic reactions to supposedly healthy products. This CereVe is marvelous! It has not only helped my skin  it has made a big difference in my granddaughters skin. She s 6 & has really inherited the skin conditions of Grandma & Daddy. Neither of us has had any reaction to CeraVe. Both of us find our skin looking smoother  softer  less thin & wrinkled in my case due to a lifetime s use of topical steriods. This CeraVe is amazing! With such high amount of hyaluronic acid  I ve been using it as a moisturizer on my face  neck & d?colletage to fight dryness & signs of aging with very good results. It comes in a very  large  19oz jar for about $20 at the local stores or $15 EA on Amazon. Which actually makes the price very reasonable. I ve been using for a month  and this jar will make at least 2 more months for both of us. That is an excellent buy. I could maybe get another month out of jar  making 4 month s of lovely  un-itchy skin for my granddaughter & I. But we ll see how long the lar lasts for sure. It does fine work!
428,Mystery Lover,1,11-Jan-18,5 people found this helpful,This is one moisturizer that delivers what it promises. It soothes dry skin immediately when you apply it  and there is a noticeable smoothness of the texture of your skin that lasts for days. It works really well on elbows and heels. I m impressed. I ve pretty much tried every product that came out claiming that it was  new  and  better  than every other product  so I wasn t expecting the good results. I m very happy with CeraVe.
429,L. Bernstein,1,18-Jun-18,6 people found this helpful,I have Sjogrens Disease  and this is the best moisturizing cream I have found to date. It really works  and a little goes a long way.
430,Torrey Bee,1,01-Jun-19,One person found this helpful,I absolutely love this stuff. Really there s not much you can say about it in a review. It works well  it works quick  and while fairly thick it eases up and thins out after applying quite quickly. The only reason it doesn t get an easy 5 stars from me is the fact the area I m using it on happens to be the dry skin in the outside corners of my nose. If you are using it on any other body part you have no worries. You can t smell it from 5 inches away  but if its literally ON your nose... Oh jeeze its bad. You do honestly get used to the smell after a while  and it only lasts a half hour or so before it fades but it has a very unique odor... it smells like a cross between a doctor s office and a paint factory. Very artificial and very strong at first. Even with the smell everything else about this is so great its not even a question of it being worth it despite the smell. Just in case I wasn t clear enough  yeah 100% worth it.
431,hear it live,1,07-Jan-19,4 people found this helpful,I ve been in medical esthetics for 20 years. Cerave is what we recommend to our patients. It is affordable  non-irritating  doesn t smell and moisturizes nicely. Stop spending $$$$ for stuff that doesn t work and buy this.
432,Patrick K.,1,04-Dec-18,2 people found this helpful,This is an honest and true review of this item  which I purchased full price on Amazon.com:  I have been using CereVe products for years. From a young age  I ve struggled with patchy Eczema. This is only lotion helps control it  even compared to Rx variants.  Last year my daughter was diagnosed with Keratosis Pilaris (probably thanks to my genetics). CeraVe in conjugation with a Ammonium Lactate lotion has dramatically helped with it.  We will continue to use this for ever. BUY IT
433,afran23,1,25-Oct-18,3 people found this helpful,I recently started to get really dry skin around my chin and nothing seemed to help  until I bought this. I use it nightly  because it is much heavier and does make the skin a bit more oily which isn’t preferably for daytime. A little goes a very long way and this has lasted me 6 months so far and it’s only halfway gone. You can really use it on any part of the body  I’d assume.
434,Peter O,1,28-Oct-16,6 people found this helpful,If your face has dry skin you re nuts if you don t try this product. I m 56 years old and have a 10-year-old daughter who would frequently comments on how dry the skin on my face was after two weeks of using the cream at night and the lotion in the morning my daughter said  wow daddy your skin is so smooth  this along with comments from several of my friends. Other creams that I used on my face with your take my eyes I ve had zero issues with this CeraVe moisturizers.
435,thegirlwhoruns,1,09-Jan-19,2 people found this helpful,I am very careful about what I use on my acne-prone  sensitive skin. This stuff did not aggravate  sting  leave a white cast  make me oily  or cause breakouts. I use it all over my face  neck  and hands. It is beautifully moisturizing without making me feel clogged. It has a luxurious feel that is not too slippery or thin. I bought the giant 19 oz tube. I would have loved a pump with it but honestly this stuff is so good that I can look past that.
436,SSG,0,14-May-15,13 people found this helpful,I m completely underwhelmed by this moisturizing cream. The Aquafor ointment is a much better product. I tried CeraVe because I am looking for a moisturizer that doesn t have the texture of vaseline. Unfortunately  the CeraVe isn t very moisturizing for dry skin  even as a body cream (how I am using up the rest of the CeraVe cream). Disappointed.
437,Sarah Beckwith,1,07-Jun-18,3 people found this helpful,I finally found the PERFECT cream! I am on chemotherapy which causes very dry  sensitive skin as a side effect. I can confidently use this product head to toe without a second thought. This cream has the perfect hydration balance and does not leave any stickiness or smell.  I will definitely purchase again and explore additional CeraVe products.
438,Kit A.,1,05-Mar-15,6 people found this helpful,Note: I wrote a very similar review for the CeraVe hydrating cleanser  because I have used both together for the same amount of time. There are a couple of additional notes regarding this moisturizer  however.  Yup. I m done. This is the best moisturizer I ve ever used.  I paired it with the CeraVe hydrating cleanser (<3) about five months ago  and had extremely good results. I couldn t believe it when I started getting compliments on my skin  as that had never happened in my entire life  but it s happened several times since I changed my routine. It took about a month for my skin to get into the groove of everything  but now even my monthly hormonal breakouts are significantly easier to deal with. My favorite thing about this moisturizer is that my dry skin is completely mitigated--it feels wonderful  and when I touch it throughout the day it feels balanced and moisturized.  A couple of notes: -I don t wear make-up -I use the Aztec Magic clay mask with apple cider about once a month now (I started with every other week  but have needed it less and less over time) -I use OTC benzoyl peroxide on the rare bad mornings -I use Neutrogena sunscreen.  That s it. Just this moisturizer 2x daily  the hydrating cleanser 2x daily  and my other small things  and my life feels different.
439,Angelina S.,1,16-Apr-19, ,Our doctor recommended this for my daughter’s sensitive skin  and it was so great that I have now purchased it for both my daughter’s and my (nearly fifty year old) self. It works better for me than the very expensive department store face creams I was using. There is virtually no scent. It is not sticky or greasy  but continues to moisturize for hours after using it. We use it on face and body both.  I have dry skin. My teenage girls have sensitive skin prone to acne. It works for all three of us. I combined it with the ceraVe sensitive skin face wash and my daughter’s acne is all but gone. This after using tons of acne treatments and washes that seemed to only work for a few days before they ultimately made it worse. Our doctor said this is because the acne washes dried her skin which encouraged her body to make more oil to send to those areas. So moisturizing seems counterintuitive  but has done the trick!
440,SW,0,14-Nov-16,4 people found this helpful,I see that a lot of people have the same question -- this item does not have any seals on it  but the tub does have a bit of plastic wrap (probably from manufacture -- it comes in a multi-pack).  I purchased this cream due to all the excellent reviews saying that it would be great for sensitive skin. However  after applying it  my skin was stinging with a light burning sensation. It unfortunately just doesn t work for me. Luckily  I was able to contact Amazon s customer service to get a refund on the product. I do like this brand s other cleansers  but will need to keep searching for a cream that will work for me.
441,jcgsees,1,15-Jun-14,9 people found this helpful,I use this cream all over  including my face and even around my eyes. This amazes me  because I have very sensitive skin and allergies and most products give me a rash and itching. I have also found that I can mix a drop or two of Timeless Hyaluronic Acid Serum or their Squalane with the CeraVe cream and have no reaction. The CeraVe cream is very effective by itself to hydrate  soothe and diminish wrinkles. I have noticed a gradual improvement in the smoothness of my skin  with irritated areas healing and my hands do not get dry with itchy rashes as much from the sanitizer I come into contact with at work. It is absorbed very rapidly and is not at all greasy nor does it leave a sheen on my face. Great for under make-up (I use mineral powder). This cream is a keeper! I also use the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser which is very gentle  doesn t strip moisturizer  but cleans effectively. So happy and relieved that between the CeraVe and Timeless brands  my search for skin care products is over!
442,jimmie moore,1,22-Jun-18,3 people found this helpful,My Dermatologist recommended this product to me. I was raised in Southern Arizona and have extra dry skin as a result. This cream has helped me more than any other cream or product in the past. I agree with my Dermatologist is saying  I recommend this cream to everyone with dry skin problems . Feel free to ask any other questions as I will be glad to answer them.
443,Laura,1,22-Dec-17,3 people found this helpful,24 year old female here.  I have very sensitive  dry skin- break out easily  red blemishes  ect. After a few trips to the dermatologist she recommended applying this product twice a day. Boy  was she right.  My overall complexion  as expected  hasn t changed. But I feel the difference- My skin drinks this stuff like milk  really soothing the dry tightness of my face. Not once have I broke out from using this cream.  Some notes: *I once got a glob of this stuff in my eye. Did not burn. Easily flushed away with little discomfort. *Make sure to keep the lid on at all times. This product becomes much less effective when dry (just sits on the skin) *I use it to treat my dry skin and occasionally remove eye makeup. I can t speak for its effectiveness in doing anything else.  Hope that helps!
444,Amber S.,1,25-Nov-18,2 people found this helpful,Love this stuff! I have very dry skin and this product is the first mosturizer that has actually worked for me. I have tried many mosturizers that work while it is on but leaves my skin feeling dryer once it has been worn or washed off. CeraVe goes on a little greasy at first but 5 mins later is soaked in  even after a shower my skin is feeling more hydrated than before. My skin is definently improving. Only con i have found is if I apply soon before using foundation it kind of flakes up a bit. Using atleast 20 mins before applying foundation I have had no issues.
445,Susan George,1,09-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,Who doesn t love a jar of cream that you can practically stick your whole body in? That s what is so nice about this  it wrks so great on your face  but you can put it from head to toe as well. My severely dry winter skin has never looked and felt so great. No breakouts  so smooth. Absorbs pretty quickly considering it is super thick and luxurious feeling. It is comparable to Cetaphil  but a few dollars more and I think I like this better. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. I am hoping it won t be too heavy come summer  but we will see. There is a reason this is so highly endorsed by dermatologists.
446,Rebecca_K,1,29-Nov-15,4 people found this helpful,I purchased this cream after reading a positive review in a beauty blog  and for the price  decided to give it a try. After using it for about a month  I m glad I did.  The texture of this body moisturizer is a dream: you can feel it getting into every nook and cranny  specially in dry areas such as elbows and forearms  but it is absorbed quite quickly  leaving no residue --I remember having to rub for about half a minute with other creams  such as Kiehl s Creme de Corps. And it does stay on: I use it for my cleavage after I take a morning shower  and when I m about to take my evening shower  I can feel the cream coming off with soap.  Also helpful? No smell. I can put this on and apply perfume less than a minute later.  It s basically everything you wanted in a body moisturizer. Definitely purchasing again one I run out of this tub.
447,JosephPlumbMartin (revolutionary war soldier),0,01-Oct-17,3 people found this helpful,great stuff for skin care.. recommended by my dermatologist many years ago.. even works in place of chap-stick but unlike chap-stick does NOT make you need to use it all the time.. UPDATE feb 12  2019 recent lot numbers of CeraVe cream emit an unusual metallic odor when applying.. i am trying to work out whether this is due to a change in the formulation or some other manufacturing or shipping effect.. i will er-edit this to include the affected lot numbers..
448,JenB,1,16-Apr-19,One person found this helpful,I have never tried Cera moisturizer cream. This was my first purchase. I have always used some type of cream after my morning shower. I was out of what I was using at the time and read the reviews for this cream and WOW I love the way it feels and moisturizing my skin. This it a BIG jar so I m very generous with it. I will definitely purschase this product again and again because it s wonderful. The scent is so light it s not noticeable. It does leave my skin feel so nice ????
449,Dogzday,1,17-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I ve had eczema since 2014 after exposure to allergens which led to uncontrollable itching. Went to dermatology and allergy for a total of around 10x over 5 years. Been given many recommendations  most worked for my skin for a few weeks then stopped working as well  even taking a break (topical steroids should not be taken for more than 2 consecutive weeks  requires 1 week break).  Tried many different prescribed topical steroid/immune-suppressing creams/ointments (desonide  fluocinide  clobetasol propionate  hydrocortisone  triamcinolone acetonide  tacrolimus  elidel  etc. These all vary  some are similar like desonide and fluocinide.  Tried many different products like Gold s Bond  Eucerin  Cetaphil  Nivea  Lubriderm  Vaseline  aloe vera products  etc. Many of them induce a burning sensation  sometimes unbearable on sensitive patches.  This stuff right here is literally the best for eczema. It feels like any other cream/sunscreen you put on  it feels a bit oily/greasy but that s because I use extra  but it doesn t burn on sensitive spots like where my eczema has flared up. I ve felt a huge different in even the first day using it. It s well worth the price. I highly recommend you couple this with Benedryl if you have eczema. Sure you might knock yourself out for a couple days and feel groggy  but do it for a week and eczema clears up really really fast.
450,Ashley Woods,1,03-Feb-19,3 people found this helpful,I’ve been using twice every day as my skin gets incredibly dry during the winter and I suffer from exzema. It’s already been amazing and I plan to use it on my elbows  toes  fingers and other exzema-affected areas. My skin is noticeably softer to the touch and it’s a million dollars cheaper than my previous Sephora moisturizer. Doesn’t leave me oily in the AM and hasn’t negatively reacted to my skin in any way. I should have ordered this a few months ago.
451,Amazon Customer,1,07-Jan-19,2 people found this helpful,This is an amazing moisturizer! The combination of ceramides and hyaluronic acid vastly increase the hydration of the skin whilst facilitating the skin to heal itself. I have also purchased the Cetaphil moisturizer in the tub and personally I prefer the CeraVe. This moisturizer isn t as emollient as Cetaphil and locks in moisturizer a lot more.
452,ES2460,1,02-Feb-18,2 people found this helpful,Arrived on time and in perfect condition. Great for sensitive and acne prone skin  moisturizes without drying or leaving residue/oily feeling. I use this on my body  neck  and face  and have had nothing but good results - I prefer using the regular moisturizer on my face rather than the AM/PM Facial moisturizers as I ve found the regular version is a bit heavier and adds a barrier of sorts while wearing makeup. I ve been using this for about 7 months now and have found that my skin is less irritated  less red  and less dry. I apply twice a day  morning and night  and feel that this is definitely worth the price. Highly recommend!
453,B Slack,1,24-May-19, ,My wife purchased this specifically for her skin changes when she got pregnant. Her skin went into full middle school breakout mode and she couldn t use her normal nightly moisturizer due to some of the ingredients. This mild and gently lotion was recommended and she absolutely loves it.  Very light scent so you can use a lot without smelling it a mile away. Great moisturizer but not heavy or greasy at the same time. Can be used as full body or facial moisturizer too. It helped keep her skin as nice as possible while still being gently enough for sensitive pregnancy skin. She has definitely stated she will continue with this lotion after the baby is born too. She wasn t a huge fan of the price for the size but a little goes a long way. A few months of use and she has barely used half of the container. Would recommend and will be buying again!
454,M. BARE,1,27-Dec-18,2 people found this helpful,I’ve been using this cream for years. I found it when my baby got eczema and this is the only one that worked on her skin. I don’t have eczema but I have dry skin all year long (thanks to dry CA weather...)  so I tried it on my skin one day. Ever since  I don’t use any other cream! This is the best.
455,Angie,1,13-May-19, ,I have to be honest  I was a little hesitant buying this because of the negative reviews. After all I was putting this on my face. But the positive reviews were more numerous and I thought to give it a try. I used it at night at first (just in case I developed a reaction).  When I opened the jar it looked creamy and no scent. It went on smooth and after a few minutes I noticed my skin didn t appear greasy at all.  I woke up to soft and non shiny skin. After applying makeup it didn t react to my foundation nor make my face shine.  I m so very happy I finally found a product that I love. Before this is gone I ll be ordering another. Great product!!
456,Eric O.,1,15-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,I have dry skin (everywhere) but bought this particularly for my face/forehead. No matter what face lotion or creams I have used my forehead is continually dry  especially in winter. I have even used CeraVe face lotion (day time and night) without success. This product  however  has done the impossible. Even without consistent daily use  my forehead is not dry and flaky. It feels soft and hydrated - especially with daily use. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks but saw a  permanent  change in my skin about one week after beginning use. The texture of this cream is thick and soft. Touching my forehead I feel the same softness  but without the sticky or tacky or greasy feel of other creams. Thinner face creams often leave me feeling as if I have to apply layer after layer because it seems to disappear. This cream seems to hydrate in my skin while also remaining as a protective layer on my skin. Super bonus: very large quantity for a very low price compared to face creams. I plan to start using on my arms and legs to see if it can also  fix  my KP. Will update with future results.
457,Alisa Lani,1,19-May-19,One person found this helpful,Everyone rave s about Neutrogena s moisturizer with hyaluronic acid  but to me  this is the same if not better because you get more product at around the same price. It s extremely moisturizing and makes my skin soft. There s people out there who say to stay away from this brand because of parabens  but there s actually no scientific proof that parabens even cause any damage.. that s all just propaganda. I love CeraVe; and they re cruelty free!
458,Isaac,0,06-Feb-17,13 people found this helpful,I picked this up on recommendation. It must work for some and not others.  I have eczema and a nickel allergy. It seems not to cause a flare up  at least on my hands  but when my nickel allergy is concerned this cream just aggravated the rash. I tried 3 different times  hoping it was maybe something else causing the flare up  but nope. This stuff made it worse  and therefore is useless to me.
459,judy l. smith,1,05-May-19,One person found this helpful,No cons to this moisturizer. It does exactly what it says it does. Dries to a nice silky powerdery feel. not greasy and makes my skin baby smooth. The biggest plus for me is that after showering at night  and not putting anything on my skin  when I wake the next morning  my skin is still smooth and soft. so it repairs and continues working even when not just applied  that s very important to me.
460,Tom H,0,06-Jan-17,8 people found this helpful,As a long time sufferer from dry and cracking skin on my feet  I tried CeraVe Moisturizing Cream. I note that the cream left a very greasy residue  which I could have lived with. After using it for 2 days  I noticed a large increase in burning and redness. I discontinued use at this point and disposed of the remainder of the cream. I’m not upset; product did not work for me.
461,DogsRunMyLife,1,12-Feb-19,One person found this helpful,I love this stuff. A little goes a long way and you can get every bit out of the jar  unlike pump bottles that seem to be designed to leave a third of the bottle unreachable by the pump tube. It is unscented and not greasy. If you don t like sticking your fingers in a jar of cream (or if you share it with others and don t want their fingers in the jar) a small spoon or paddle works well. A silicon spatula from a kid s cooking set might be ideal.
462,K. Willis,1,24-Feb-18,One person found this helpful,My 8 year old has always suffered with eczema and dry skin. When he goes long periods of time not using any moisturizers his skin suffers pretty bad. Recently it was the worst I’ve seen. It was so bad his skin cracked open & it was very painful for him. I ordered this after raving reviews & started using it on the dry  cracked areas generously. We would apply it once a day after his shower and within a week his skin was healed. So happy I made this purchase. The bonus is it is completely scent free. My son did not want to  smell like a girl  when I applied my lotion (Olay Quench) so he did not fight me with applying this cream.
463,KESS,1,11-Apr-16,3 people found this helpful,I ve been using this close to 10 years  since my Dermatologist recommended it and my previous brand (Kyle) had gone out of business. It works well  but ever since I tried?CeraVe Baby Lotion?(after reading others reviews)  I really prefer that. This has always has a tackiness to it until it s been dry for awhile. After it dries  your skin will feel smoother but there also seems to be a drag  where the Baby Lotion is just smooth and silky. One thing I really like using this on  is when I have a psoriasis outbreak; as it seems to work almost as well the Rx cream I have. I haven t had an outbreak lately (thankfully) to see how the Baby CeraVe works. When I do  I ll report it in that review.

I have somewhat sensitive skin and have not been bothered at all by the moisturizer. Will definitely purchase again.
465,Amazon Customer,1,05-Aug-18,One person found this helpful,this cream i was allergic to only because i ahve a coconut allergy. if you are allergic to coconut scented products  this cream has an ingredient that has caused allergies BUT i’m giving this 4 stars because if you don’t have that  this cream is great. i wanted to love this because the amount of product is unreal  it’s smooth on the skin and isn’t super thick or thin. yes i can’t use this on my face but i can’t use it on some parts of my body just fine. remember to read ingredients and know what you’re allergic to. (if it feels hot or burns you may be allergic)

468,Diana,1,27-Dec-17,2 people found this helpful,Really great cream for the body and even the cheeks. Not for the eyes. My 3yo has a strong eczema reaction to the dry weather (very delicate skin) and living in Minnesota doesn’t help. We’ve tried everything and this has been a true hit  except on the eyes. It burned the skin. Looking through other reviews  I see it happens to a lot of people. Keep away from the eyelids and under the eyes.
469,Kaitlin H.,1,13-Sep-18,One person found this helpful,Very thick cream lotion BUT it absorbs nicely if you dont over apply and even then is mostly absorbs. I actually used this through all 9 months of my pregnancy and gained a horrendous amount of weight due to edema so my skin was STRETCHING to It s max and I did not get a single mark until after delivery when I had been to preoccupied to remember to use this. If you want something light tho this is not for you.

It healed a wedding ring rash that was causing my skin to peel and look scalded. I hadnt worn my wedding ring in 2 months and this cream healed it in a week. I even used it to ease the itch of chigger bites because i had nothing else nearby at the time and i was at my wits end. And it actually made the itching stop. Wow. And this stuff is cheap too.
471,Margaret,1,26-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,Excellent product. Great skin care. I was using an expensive doctor-prescribed lotion until I started using this and found it does a much better job of keeping my skin from getting dry and itchy. In fact  I was trying to get my husband interested in it recently after I noted his flakey skin. Since there is no fragrance it is good for all genders.
472,DLB,1,19-Jan-17,4 people found this helpful,This product is wonderful. I have been using it on hands  face  feet  and ankles. Prior to use  the skin on my finger tips was so dry and cracked  it was difficult to do anything. This cream has completely remedied the problem. It absorbs quickly  is not greasy  and has returned my skin to a much more comfortable and younger appearance.
473,Samantha,1,21-Feb-18,One person found this helpful,I’ve went through countless tubs of this cream. In my opinion  it’s the best moisturizer you can get for your body. It’s dermatologist reccomended. There’s no fragrance  it has hyaluronic acid and ceramides in it which are incredibly beneficial. Put this on wet skin after a shower and let it dry. You’ll feel renewed. You can also put this on your face if you have dry skin  I have and it feels so nice. It won’t clog your pores  I promise. It’s incredible and worth every penny. I’ll continue to buy this forever.
474,Linh N,1,10-May-19, ,I have extremely sensitive skin. I can only use fungal acne safe facial products and unscented products on my body. This product was recommended by simpleskincarescience and I love this moisturizer for what it is. It moisturizes my skin and keeps it supple after a shower. However  if you get back acne easily  then ease up on this product because it gives me a few pimples here and there lol. Just make sure that you scrub your back w a gentle wash cloth or loofah every day/every other day.
475,Tina K.,1,09-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,There s hardly any odor in this fast absorbing cream. Banish winter dry  raw  chapped skin with some of this cream. You can use it on your face  your hands  your body... almost anywhere for dry skin. I purchased a  tub  and I believe it will last a long time. Tip: we use a folding  disposable spoon to minimize cross-contamination.
476,thatgirl,1,04-Apr-19, ,I love this cream. It soaks right in without being greasy. I have it in my Subscribe and Save items. I tried it on my face  and while I didn t have a bad reaction  it did seem to clog some pores  but my face is very sensitive  both oily and dry  so I m not surprised. I think it s the thickness of the cream that didn t work for my face  but it s perfect for me body. The price has been going up  so I m not sure I ll be able to continue buying this regularly  which makes me sad.
477,D. Yager III,1,10-Apr-19, ,Saw this recommended on reddit when I was looking for a new face moisturizer. I can t believe how well this stuff works for the price. I was paying big money for L Oreal and other fancy creams that come in ridiculously tiny bottles. This stuff may not have added bonuses like retinol or CoQ10 or sunscreen but frankly it doesn t need them. My skin looks and feels as soft as it ever did with the other stuff. And you get a giant tub of this for cheap! Call me a convert.
478,Natalie,1,11-Jun-19, ,???????????? absolutely everything about CeraVe products. This brand is a clean healthy line in my opinion that does what it says & keeps my skin balanced which helps with breakouts & dry skin. I have used CeraVe for about 6 months now as I just simply didn’t find any interest in this brand but I tell you I will always use their facial cleanser & moisturizer &/or lotion. Along with using A313  CeraVe has turned my skin around more than anything I’ve ever tried & I’m not exaggerating. Again this is what helps my skin as I’ve tried156 588 different skincare brands AND products/treatments & the 2 brands I talked about above will always be a part of my NOW simple & gentler daily & nightly face cleansing routine that I do.
479,CS,1,06-Feb-17,One person found this helpful,The entire family uses. This is great for the entire body including the face. It was recommended by a dermatologist and has meet all our dry skin needs as well as addressing mild eczema. Highly recommend as an every day lotion to have near the sink.  We also use the SA to keep our skin smooth and clear. Works great for breakouts and bumpy arms. It basically sloughs the top layer of skin off  not allowing the pores to clog.  Will continue to use and recommend.  Update: still using and love. Staple for years. Also have been using the PM moisturizer and love it. Perfect for whole family.
480,Leia709,1,16-Oct-17,2 people found this helpful,I have purchased Cetaphil s lotion?Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream for Dry/Sensitive Skin  Fragrance Free 16 oz (Pack of 2)before and this is pretty much the same. This one might be a SMIDGE lighter  but that s just me being nit-picky. Honestly I could probably go either way  CeraVe or Cetaphil  whichever one was cheaper at the time.
481,Trini,0,27-Feb-19,2 people found this helpful,Wish I would have read the ingredients before purchasing. It’s full of parabens. Will not use this. I saw it advertised and purchased without reading. I will definitely not use this product. Waste of money. Will end up in the garbage as I would not give to a friend or family member.
482,Susana,1,23-Jun-19, ,After I discovered this brand of cream  I use nothing else. They have several types  and this one is great for extremely dry skin. Keeps my hands well moistured if used after each time hands exposed to water. Another reason I like this is I am sensitive to fragrance and have had no problems with this cream. Would also recommend their other products  especially the diabetic skin cream. Their products are a little expensive but worth it.
483,Allie,1,24-Feb-17,One person found this helpful,I really like this product and have been using it for over a year. I first heard about this cream when a friend  who has a son with eczema  recommened it to me for my child  who also has eczema.  I really like this product because it doesn t smell at all and has no dyes. It works really well to prevent eczema as long as you us it daily. The cream isnt super thick so it is easy to put on. However  be careful if you store it upside down or on its side because it was pour out when you open it.  From what I have seen Amazon has the best price - especially if you do the subscribe and save program!
484,amazon_derp,1,01-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I have used this product for two weeks now and I am quite satisfied. Here are the things i like: 1. There is almost no smell from this product. 2. It is one of the best moisturizer I have used. Keeps skin soft and moisturized the entire day. It absorbs very easily and is not at all oily. 3. I am not sure about this but my skin seems to be responding well to this. There are fewer marks on my skin now.
485,Jessica,1,14-Sep-18,One person found this helpful,This is absolutely one of the best moisturizing creams I ve ever used. My dermatologist recommended this to me years ago  because I have sensitive skin and eczema. I love to put this on after shower specially. I ve tried other creams from the drugstore and nothing can replace this one. I swear if they ever just continue this I will cry.
486,Lee,1,31-Aug-18, ,I bought this originally to use on my face but it didn t work out. On my face it didn t relieve tightness and flaking (think it was from the hot weather and sweating). I have sensitive  middle-age skin and my regular moisturizer is glycerin-based but I felt I needed something a little richer. However  on my body this cream is better than Cetaphil for me. I liked that it went on smooth  not sticky  and didn t wash off very easily. Not great for my hands but good for the rest of me. I like the texture quite a bit.
487,Danubia,1,17-Jun-19, ,I absolutely love this stuff! Putting it on reminds me of putting makeup primer and I’m obsessed with it. I have dry dry dry DRY skin that gets incredibly oily. Since using this  I actually get more oily but my skin has to adjust to the sudden moisture change so I’m not worried about it. It makes me skin feel amazing  I started using it for full body moisturizing but specifically use it for my face. A little goes a long way so the Tub will last a good while
488,Amanda,1,22-May-19, ,I don t say this lightly - this product saved my skin. For years I was using Ponds Moisturizing Cream and then started to notice more blister-like acne and little patches on my skin. I then transitioned to an all-natural regimen of oils and mists. This helped for a bit  but they weren t as moisturizing. I was searching around and found this  holy Grail  - it changed my life! I haven t broken out since and my eczema has completely cleared. If I go a few days without taking  great  care of my skin and notice any imperfections I apply this lotion and within HOURS it has cleared or significantly improved. Even dry spots on hands and knees  overnight they are gone! Fabulous lotion and I will never give it up ??
489,plevee,0,03-Mar-19, ,I have total bogy eczema and have tried just about every moisturizer that exists. I had great hope for this because of the ceramides and positive reviews. Unfortunately I found it moisturized poorly and transiently.. I will have to return to Eucerin Skin Calming and Eczema relieving creams - these work much better but are available only in tubes so stiff it s a trial to get the stuff out and half the creme remains in the tube however hard one squeezes.
490,Dalia L,1,30-Oct-16,One person found this helpful,This is my favorite daytime moisturizer for three reason.  1. The size and cost of the tub. 2. It doesn t irritate my skin. 3. Provides the perfect amount of moisture for daytime.  I have very dry  very sensitive skin and I have a hard time finding products that don t sting or cause breakouts. And this does not.  It feels great on the skin and works well under sunscreen.  I would choose a different product for the nighttime if you have dry skin. Something like the original nivea cream.  I bought my first jar of this almost 6 months ago and I still have bit left.
491,Eric Carlson,1,12-Jun-19, ,I never write reviews but this one has changed my routine/face for the better so I had to share.  I’ve been using expensive moisturizers in combination with a system of cleansers and toners to help combat acne/breakouts/dull skin I developed in my late 20s  and I was finding that although the products worked  my skin was left so dry it felt tight and would flake constantly.  I was applying moisturizer to my face multiple times a day and nothing worked  within an hour or two it would dry out again. So glad I found this and took a chance. The first use it worked better than anything else I’ve had and it’s a fraction of the price.  I use this product typically once a day  after showering or after I’ve washed my face and it works all day.  I can’t recommend this enough. It is lightweight  not greasy  doesn’t have a strong smell  and it makes my face look so healthy and soft. I don’t plan to buy anything else!
492,DetroiterAZ,1,21-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,I use it both for my face and body and love it for both uses. After I apply this cream  my face is super smooth without being greasy (I don t apply the cream to the T-zone) and perfect for application of blush etc. My body (back  legs  butt) also becomes very soft without being sticky like some lotions can do. The smell is gentle  almost not noticeable. And there is so much in the container! I will recommend it to my mom and to my sister. It s a fantastic deal for the quality and utility.
493,N. Brunk,1,08-Feb-14,4 people found this helpful,I have sensitive  dry skin  and an unappealing  if not serious  skin condition called keratosis pilaris. Even worse  I have serious allergies to many ingredients commonly found in most skin products. There aren t many products that are safe for me to use with my allergies and that actually work. The three best brands for me to use or cerave  cetaphil  and amlactin. Of the three cerave is by far the best. It keeps my skin healthy and moisturized  even in winter (which is often just a terrible time for my skin) but doesn t leave me feeling sticky afterward. When my skin is very dry  it sometimes doesn t feel like it s quite enough and I have to apply more often. But overall  this is has been a great product for me and is more affordable than others that I ve tried.  I also like that it comes in a jar  absolutely none of the product goes to waste.
494,Prime member ??,1,09-Jun-19, ,If I could give this 50 ?? stars I would. My husband and my son had extremely bad eczema. So bad that his pediatrician scheduled to meet with the dermatologist in July. We tried every product on the market literally. All the other products kept making his skin worse. My husband seen a commercial for this and told me to order it for our son. We have been using it for almost a week now and his skin has cleared up amazing. I wish I had before pictures but they weren’t really that clear so we attached pictures since using it. He does still try to itch but we stop him. This product is amazing!!!! We use it 2 times a day on him. If you haven’t you should try this product.
495,c. hop.,1,07-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I started using this after facial cryosurgery  which is just a fancy way of saying I got age spots frozen off of my face. It was immediately calming and refreshing. It was not greasy and absorbed quickly. I ve been using it for over a month now and I highly recommend this!
496,Yolanda Mason,1,22-Feb-16,4 people found this helpful,I ve been using cerave moisturizing cream for 2 of my children. One has extremely dry skin  and the other suffers from a touch of eczema. Since I ha e started using this particular moisturizer I have seen great improvement in both skin conditions. I have been using it consistently to keep their delicate skin moist and smooth. I love it so much that it has become my go-to cream to use when my hands get a little dry from the cold.
497,jackie turcotte,1,03-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,My dermatologist recommended this for an all over body and face cream. I was willing to buy something more pricy  but she ademently encouraged I give this a try. Boy  am I glad I did! I use it on my face and body- Midwest winters are harsh and drying  but this cream has been a bit of a life changer for me.
498,gbv4me,1,01-Nov-14,6 people found this helpful,This CeraVe cream has been absolutely amazing for my face. I ve suffered with dry skin and rosacea most of my life  and after being disappointed with the Clinique line I started looking for a moisturizer that would actually work without breaking me out. This moisturizing cream was definitely the answer! I use it morning and night  and my face looks so much better in just a matter of 3 months. The redness in my cheeks has went down  no new breakouts  and a lot less problems with dry skin. I love this stuff!
499,etpssi,1,30-Apr-19,One person found this helpful,I have dry skin. Age  Florida heat and workouts  pool chlorine are all contributing factors. At my (awesome) dermotologist’s suggestion  now wash with a tea tree oil liquid soap an use this stuff on arms and legs. Result? No itching. No flaking.
500,Amazon Customer,1,08-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,As an old guy who has spent a great deal of his life outside  putting cream on my face that wasn t sunscreen just wasn t something I was expecting to do. My face really dried out the past couple of years of active kayaking  so I bought some cream at the grocery  but really didn t see results that encouraged continued use. My doctor told me I needed to start using a moisturizing cream  and by chance I came across CeraVe on Amazon. I read the reviews  and that convinced me to give it a try. The change in the skin on my nose and forehead was remarkable. Now it s a daily routine. I went to my Dermatologist and mentioned I had found this  stuff  that I really liked  and when I told him the name  he told me   Isn t it amazing?  I have to agree.
501,R. S. R.,1,02-May-19,One person found this helpful,This is great for extremely dry skin  face moisturizer  and eczema. I recommend you give this a go if you re suffering from chronic dry skin. I ve also tried Amlactin  which I don t prefer for everyday use because it burns and leaves a sticky residue for me. I typically use Amlactin whenever I have a flare up  but I haven t had a flareup since I began using CeraVe.
502,Jillian S,1,03-May-19, ,My skin is very sensitive and once my hands get so dry they crack and bleed there is no lotion on the market I could use without breaking out in hives... until now. Once my skin breaks open I’m not able to use anything. I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on creams that are too watery and don’t retain moisture on my skin. This location is thick and creamy. Plus works for my sensitive skin
503,Bianca B.,1,04-Apr-19, ,I ve tried all the bougie moisturizers  doctor prescribed and Tatcha included - this is the sh*t. I can t stress enough how good this is to my skin. I have lupus and otherwise chronically dry peeling skin. My sassy co-workers often ask what is wrong with my face and I ve always just had to deal with it. Using this morning and night fixed it - immediately. Now my face can be appreciated for its true and radiant glory. THANK YOU FACE MOISTURIZER COMPANY ??
504,Buffalo free,1,09-Mar-19, ,This stuff works great. I am allergic to normal hand creams like gold bond. The skin around my eyes Is extremely sensitive but this lotion has not bothered me at all. I do not use it on my face but Gold Bond lotion causes acne problems because when I use it as a hand lotion I end up rubbing my face and therefore causing zits. I have not had that problem with this lotion. I highly recommend it.
505,c,1,12-Jun-19, ,I like how moist it makes my skin  but its so thick that it just doesn t dry into my skin well and I can feel it all day even after putting it on my skin at night. It also hasn t been that great at keeping acne away. I don t get bad acne  but I was doing okay for awhile and then it began breaking out in several spots after I started using it. Maybe it was just my skin adjusting to a new product since it has calmed down  but I m still extra careful now to put as small amount as possible without leaving places without moisture.
506,MJ Cooper. Honest reviews.,0,09-Sep-18,3 people found this helpful,Greasy which it says it is not. Trashed. Waste of money.
507,Julie secrist,1,15-Jan-19,2 people found this helpful,After 3 weeks  I see improvement in my skin. Less flaky skin & overall smoother. Using twice/day. My dermatologist recommended.
508,Sharon,1,18-Sep-17,3 people found this helpful,I have been using this for quite a few years now. Love the product and the fact that it has hyaluronic acid in it. Does not leave a greasy skin feeling  absorbs quickly. Works great  use it daily.
509,gracie_gust,0,20-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,This was a waste of money I purchased this hoping it will help repair my red flaking skin from this super dry winter and I have seen zero improvement  there is no smell at all and it does not feel nourishing after you apply.
510,Deal Seeker,1,18-Apr-19, ,After turning 50  I noticed my face was getting dry. I tried Olay  L Oreal  and several other brands with no success. This product goes on smooth without the greasy  wet look and feeling. The smell is minimal - no perfume type fragrance. I do not break out either. My husband started using it regularly. The jar is really large for the price. Great deal and wonderful product!
511,Walter Dog of Action,1,15-Jul-14,4 people found this helpful,I have dry  super sensitive skin. My dermatologist recommended this for me to use morning and night. I love it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it is so rich that when I would use sunscreen or makeup in the daytime it would end up looking really weird and streaky. My new derm said it was too thick and rich for day and now I switched to Cera Ve PM lotion which works great for dry  sensitive skin and looks good under sunscreen and makeup. I still use this at night though.  I also used this on my babies  skin as a full body lotion  and it worked great. Although my son who has sensitive skin complained that it stung his face.
512,Ashley Dean,1,29-Jun-19, ,Oh-em-geeee!!! This stuff puts my $200 skin serums to SHAME! I feel like an idiot for over spending all these years and fighting my dry patches when I could have purchased this all along. I found the face wash as well  it s more like a cleansing lotion. I use them both once a day and in less than 2 weeks my skin is DEWEY when it was trashed before! Holy crap!
513,Brandon L,1,05-Nov-18,One person found this helpful,Pros: Excellent value. This is a bucket of cream for a small price. Within two weeks I parted with my Oil of Olay staple due to better value and results. Cons: The cream can feel a bit waxy but it s meant to be a skin  protectant  due to the Ceramide rich no-frills formula. That s the only reason why I shaved-off a quarter of a star  so I choose 5 instead of 4! I use this twice daily (heavier application at night)  with a Retinol A and Vitamin C serum for a complete skin care portfolio.  Summary: Unbeatable value/Skin friendly/Great results Even if it feels a little waxy ( and I do mean a little)  it s for a good reason!
514,CC,0,01-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,CeraVe has always been my go to for creams and lotion. I love this company  however I was let down by this one particular cream. It says  face and body  but the moisturizer is definitely not made for face (or at least my families). It is really oily and thick on the face  not good for those with combination or oily prone skin. Wish I had went with another brand...
515,Loretta,1,20-Mar-19, ,I was hesitant to use this on my face because the container doesn t specifically say that it s a facial moisturizer  and I was afraid that it would be too heavy. After reading many reviews  I decided to give it a try. I ve only used it for a few days  but so far so good. It s very moisturizing without feeling greasy and I no longer have flaky  dry patches on my face.
516,Echo,1,14-Jan-19, ,Excellent product. Goes on very light and sinks into your hands very quickly. Wonderful solution for office hands. When I go out side to do something I have to go back to the Norwegian one because this one does not stay on. It washes up very easily. I love that I can apply it to my hands and an hour later I can easily rinse it off if I need to to make dinner. It’s excellent for the entire body.
517,Becky E.,1,04-Aug-18,2 people found this helpful,Husband has used everything over the years  in and out of the hospital for dry skin due to poor circulation and he says this has literally helped to heel really dry sore spots.
518,Amazon Customer,1,04-Apr-19, ,My face gets so dry in the winter  and I ski regularly  meaning I typically have dry spots and bumps  especially around my goggle line. I’ve tried many lotions  but I also have sensitive skin and most of what I tried turned my skin red or caused irritation or breakouts. I had read great reviews for CeraVe and decided it was worth a try. When I first used it  I felt a slight stinging sensation. I didn’t wake up with any redness or irritation  though  so I stuck with it for a few days. The stinging stopped and my skin felt smoother than it has in a very long time! No redness  no breakouts  no anything! I’ve been using this for a few months and refuse to go a day without it. I will definitely buy more when I need it  but the container is so large that it lasts a while. Highly recommend!
519,Katie Kate,1,22-Jan-14,3 people found this helpful,My son s dermatologist recommended this as part of his treatment for some pretty severe eczema/dermatitis. 2 years later we ve resolved a LOT of his skin issues since we discovered he had food allergies that were causing the outbreaks. I still stash this stuff everywhere. I ve tried all sorts of lotions and creams for my winter dry skin and always come racing back to this. It doesn t feel like I have anything on my skin  it doesn t feel greasy  but when I shower I can feel that it s still there once my skin is wet. It s amazing stuff. Vanicream  aquaphilic  eucerine and similar products are all what my dermatologist refers to as  slop  you put on your skin  I couldn t agree more. This seems to really get in and give a great  long lasting moisture to skin. I m hooked!
520,MQue,1,22-Aug-18,One person found this helpful,I have extremely dry skin  and when using this face cream after splashing water on my face locks in the moisture. Since I’ve been using this cream  my friends and family have taken notice and remarked about how my skin looks amazing. No joke! I’m a believer in this product. Even my aesthetician wants to try this as she has noticed the difference in my skin.??
521,Kylie,1,29-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,I loved this stuff!! I have skin very prone to dryness and breaking. I was not disappointed. It is very creamy/thick but goes on well and doesn’t feel sticky or heavy. I put it on after exfoliating and woke the next morning soft and hydrated. I keep using it on my cracking hands and it’s done a great job so far. I would absolutely recommend this to a friend!
522,Hey There,1,11-Aug-18,One person found this helpful,Thick  rich moisturizer that does not irritate my skin (I have eczema on many parts of my body including my face) and does not clog my pores (this varies for everyone  make sure to patch test). The size of the jar has made it last a long time. Will be buying again when it runs out.
523,susie q,1,27-Aug-18,2 people found this helpful,I am 69 and have discovered this year that the really expensive cream I was using was no longer doing the job . CeraVE absorbed into my skin very quickly. The crepe paper appearance has lessened and my skin softened ...just two days into use. Says it all for me.
524,Kate Peterson,1,06-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,This stuff is amazing. I was used to using Neutrogena Hydroboost gel at night  and would spent roughly $18/month on it. I will never go back to it after using CeraVe. It looks thick  but applies smoothly and doesn’t cake on. Leaves skin soft and hydrated without feeling too heavy of a moisturizer. The best part is that the container is HUGE. This will last me months for half the cost on what I used to use. If you’re on the fence about buying it - do it! You won’t regret it.
525,DK,1,02-Dec-18, ,I have the driest skin... this is one of the few lotions that really works. It is unscented which I appreciate as some lotions have hideous scents. I was getting calluses on my elbows from doing planks and this solve the problem. I even use this on my neck and face. I have tried the most expensive face creams and none of them really do much of anything. Really moisturizes.
526,Mary C Johnson,1,06-Jun-19, ,I bought this 2 weeks ago and decided to use it for eye cream  day cream  night cream  and body cream all in one jar. I am so thrilled to tell that it works wonderful on all those areas. My whole adult life I have bought a different cream for all these areas. One jar in my bathroom is a miracle. I highly recommend this product.
527,Steve,1,05-Apr-19,One person found this helpful,I used this for dry skin on my face and it has helped a lot. Have been using for about 3 weeks now. Can see a big difference. Put it on morning and night. Took me about 3 days to really start seeing results. Best thing I’ve used on my face pretty much ever.
528,J. Osborne,1,26-May-17,2 people found this helpful,I used this on my belly every day while pregnant and never got a stretch mark :) I don t think it is marketed for this purpose but it worked for me! I had tried anti-stretch mark serums  but I have sensitive skin and all the other ones made me itchy/trashy. But the CeraVe was never itchy  always soothing.
529,H.F.,1,08-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,I use a lot of CeraVe products but the only thing that really stops me from buying more is the parabens. This cream is amazing on my face and hands. I have very dry skin in the winter and wash my hands a lot for work. This has really helped me out. It sinks in very fast and isn t greasy. If they changed the paraben situation  I would always exclusively buy CeraVe.
530,Learyin,1,04-May-19, ,I am so glad I got this! I have very dry skin and my legs are very sensitive. Most lotions irritate my legs  but not this!! I see a HUGE improvement in my skin  especially my legs. They are no longer dry and itchy. I even get really bad dry patches on the back of my arms. Those are now gone. I put this on right after I pat dry from a shower and it has really changed my skin.
531,J. Alden,1,21-Jul-14,5 people found this helpful,Hydrates  soothes  softens. I love this stuff. I have moderately dry skin and wanted to start a regiment of moisturizing and hydrating. This stuff lives up to the good reviews. Only 3 days in  but already reaping the rewards.  Take care of your skin people!!!!  Read my other reviews to see about other products related to skin protection. I m a guy  and like many men  I didn t pay much attention to my skin till dryness and spots started. I m happy with the product choices I ve made so far. Skin is happy.
532,Alex :-),1,23-Mar-19, ,My derm recommended this for my dry skin many years ago  and I ve never found anything I like better. I don t really use it in the summer much  but fall - spring I can really tell the difference when I don t take the time to use it. I also like that it doesn t have any scent. Now if only it was EWG recommended  it would be perfect!
533,BettyLu,1,16-Feb-19,One person found this helpful,This is the best lotion/cream that I have ever used for sensitive skin. I have tried a lot because I get rashes easily and this is the best. I use it after every shower and my skin stays rash free and soft even in the winter.
534,Suki Niko,1,04-Jan-16,One person found this helpful,I bought this only to use on my decollete  since it was inexpensive and got good reviews. I had a separate moisturizer for my face. I really like the way it feels ... not thick or sticky. I asked my esthetician about it and she said she uses it as a facial moisturizer  as well as the chest. I see no difference between this product and a more expensive facial moisturizer. Very pleased. (I am also an esthetician  but I work only on family and friends  so not very experienced. The girl I use is a medical esthetician with 22 yrs experience. I trust her implicitly  and was glad to hear the good news about CeraVe).
535,Martha,1,03-May-17,5 people found this helpful,Great moisturizer for your skin. Not greasy at all.
536,Caitlan Wagner,1,28-Nov-15,One person found this helpful,We purchased this after our pediatrician recommended it for our son s dry skin. I absolutely love it! It is not greasy!  I also asked my pediatrician if I should be concerned that it contains parabens and got the following response  The FDA has determined parabens to be safe in any quantity that you would ever reasonably use. The studies that I ve seen that suggest worrisome side effects were not well-constructed  were not in human subjects  and (if I recall correctly) used very high doses that you would not see in real life. So the short answer is that I don t think it s worth worrying about. 
537,Pearl,1,03-Mar-19, ,I m glad i purchased this. I actually feel like this is better quality than the Cetaphil. My skin feels good  and i feel like more healing is taking place with this cream than the cetaphil. This is my new product for face and skin. Try it  i definitely recommend  and i have sensitive skin  it may work for you. So far so good.
538,Amazon Customer,1,19-Feb-19, ,CeraVe has been always recommended by my dermatologist. My skin is very sensitive to various chemicals included in cosmetics so I have to be very careful what I use. I have been using neutrogena for years and am still using it but I added cerave to my daily routine. My skin is soft and has a nice healthy glow! I also use it on my hands and body after showering. Definitely worth it.
539,Abimisola,1,18-Apr-16,One person found this helpful,I finally visited a dermatologist few days ago and all I can say is fantastic after 3 summers of bumps and pain that left scars on my body. This product was recommended for me because of my skin problem and very dry skin. I only apply it vigorously on my body once in a day and my body just stays moisturized. I am gonna purchase the hand lotion too cause it has been a life saver for me. So relieved now I can t explain it. Try it out and see for yourself. Do buy the jar because it is not watered down and you reap the benefits more
540,William C.,1,07-Jun-16, ,This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. It felt a little thick at first since it s a cream  but the feeling disappears after a few minutes. I tried experimenting with it in the winter by putting it on one arm and not the other. On the next day  the arm that had it was significantly less dry and felt so much smoother. I recommend CeraVe for anyone who has dry skin.  My friend also used it for her eczema. It was very effective as it reduced dryness and itchiness. Over a longer period  it even reduced the eczema. It also seemed to form a protective layer so scratching doesn t hurt the skin as much. Anyway  the effects were pretty amazing.
541,April Barr,1,03-Feb-17,2 people found this helpful,I ve been using this moisturizer for years. I use it each night before bed and a container lasts me almost exactly one year. It does a great job of keeping my sensitive skin moist  even during the driest winter months  and it is not greasy at all. I also appreciate that it doesn t have much of an odor to it. Very mild.
542,Lynn,1,22-Apr-19, ,I have been using this product for about six months to moisturize my body and face during the winter months. This is a solid product that helps keep my dry  sensitive skin hydrated all day. Great consistency (not as thick as a moisturizing butter  or some creams  but not runny like most lotions). No heavy perfumes  this product is unscented. 19oz jar lasts me about a month and a half and reasonably priced. Highly recommend.
543,Pen Name,1,20-Jun-19, ,Help to protect forearms from Senile Purpura due to age and extensive sun damage in youth. Essentially it seems to help redirect contact allowing bumps or other contact to slide off. Essentially lessening the chance of ugly purple bruises or maks. Also helps to where light bamboo or silk sleeves .
544,Halszka,1,21-May-16,13 people found this helpful,This is one of my veeery favorite moisturizer. I can use it not only to hydrate my body but also my face. I have sensitive prone to break outs skin and this one is non-comedogenic and really gentle. I will re-purchase all over and over again :)!
545,VW,1,27-Apr-16,2 people found this helpful,I moved from a humid city to a more arid one (If you can call Washington  DC arid)  causing my skin to become extremely dry (to the point that things like scrubbing my hands or using a wash cloth caused brush burn). I bought this lotion as a last resort and am (and this is an under statement here) truly amazed at how awesome it is. I use this lotion all over my body (including on my face) after I shower in the morning and am pretty sure I ll never go back to my pre-moisturizing days. Before this whole humidity-shock issue  I was a relatively  um  greasy person. I had never had dry skin issues and was kind of afraid that using this product would cause me to break out  but I couldn t have been more wrong. I actually think I have a clearer complexion now  which (I would guess) is because my skin isn t working overtime to produce oil. Truly amazing.
546,Leasa Bonnallie,1,30-Apr-19, ,I had a terrible itching issue that came on suddenly. While my immunologist started the process of ruling things out he gave me a list of things to try. This lotion was on the list. It turned out to be an allergic reaction to my meds. I’m so glad I tried this lotion as I’m in love!! Dry elbows-gone! Dry heels-gone! Random dry spots-gone! I recommend it to everyone!
547,anon,1,07-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,I have eczema and this is the only nonprescription gentle product that works! Overnight application is best. I ve bought many tubs of these for face and body. I do prefer the pump because I don t like dipping my fingers into the tub. Sometimes I pour it into an empty travel bottle so it s in a squeezable bottle and easier to use.
548,Kelcey E.,1,10-Jan-19, ,I live in Michigan and my skin gets really dry during the winter because the furnace is constantly running and drying out the air. This moisturize is wonderful for my face. I tend to have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts- I have tried several mositurizers and this has been my favorite. I also use the PM moisturizer as well
549,BB,1,21-Apr-19, ,If you have dry  itchy  sensitive mature skin....buy this!! I also use this as my face moisturizer. This is my third jar!! Works!! Also my husband has dry  flakey skin on arms and face from using a prescription cream for Basel cell carcinoma. His dermatologist recommended this for him. Works to relieve the itching and dryness.
550,RunnyYolks,1,21-Feb-15,2 people found this helpful,I use this on my face in winter after wiping it with Thayers witch hazel and rose water. It s incredible. Sinks right in and plumps up my skin. Not at all greasy so if I apply makeup it doesn t slide all over my face  but deeply moisturizes. I m a 40 year old Caucasian woman with pretty dry skin  and I live in New England so the wintertime air both inside and out is really quite harsh. This is the only thing that has kept my skin from drying out in the day. At night I use some Egyptian Magic  too and it s really done more than anything else for my parched skin. Best product I ve found.
551,Sally U,1,01-Dec-14,2 people found this helpful,My husband had a couple rough patches of skin and his doctor recommended this as part of his treatment. It s a really great  thick cream. I use it on my face and it leaves my skin very soft with no problems. I have very sensitive skin  especially around my eyes  and this has never given me any problems.  It s a huge container and you only need to use a small amount  so this jar will last a long time  several months. I forget how much we paid for our first jar at Walgreens  but it s significantly less expensive on Amazon.  Not much else to say - this is a really great cream and a great price.
552,Diana,1,09-Nov-15,One person found this helpful,This stuff works great! I have used DML and the Cera-Ve night lotions and this is my favorite. During the winter  my face gets so dry and peels. I use this in the morning under makeup and at night before going to bed  and it keeps my face from peeling. It is non-comodegenic  so it doesn t make my face break out. My only grievance is I wish it had SPF in it  but I usually just put foundation on top of it which has SPF in it. So if you have dry skin  I would give this stuff a shot. The bottle is huge and using it twice per day throughout the year lasts about a year.
553,Haley Benner,1,31-May-16,2 people found this helpful,I use this on my entire family. My kids have sensitive skin and eczema in the colder weather. This was the first year no ones skin was in trouble because we used the cerave daily. We used to use restoraderm but switched to cerave because it was less oily. It really absorbs well and makes my skin feel amazing. I ve stopped using all the fancy and expensive facial lotions and just use this now.
554,Karen M,1,08-May-15,2 people found this helpful,I use this every night after the CeraVeMoisturizing Lotion (on my face)...just dab around my eyes and on any other dry areas...just a lovely lovely night cream (in small amounts). This line is just very hydrating and skin friendly. I also use the liquid foam cleanser - all are awesome products! Immediately after I starting using this line of products  I noticed how soft my skin was  and it didn t hurt anymore after washing or exfoliating. It really does help rejuvenate your skins natural barrier...can t live with out any of these products anymore.
555,kochu,1,08-Apr-19, ,Ok. So I JUST received this product like 10 minutes ago and the package was handed to my dad. He opened it and asked me   why’d you buy all this stuff?  Well. I immediately said that he had to use this moisturizer. I wanted to know what type of reaction he would give. Since I’ve never used this product I used my dad as a test subject. Trust me. I’m not a bad daughter.  Anyway  he used it and in 2 minutes he said that this moisturizer was amazing. My dad is very hard to impress. He loved this moisturizer. He also loves the price. It was cheap. We used to use the neutrogena hydro boost water gel  but it was only 50ml and was a little pricy.  I recommend this. EVERYONE BUY THIS!!!
556,fc,1,23-May-15,3 people found this helpful,Incredible! My son has eczema that is very bad when the seasons change  and his prescription cream takes weeks to work  and often times he has areas that crack and bleed...I started using this cream on him  and after 3 days  yes only 3 days....his dry scaly bumpy spots are almost gone!!!and he stopped itching immediately after the first application. I can t wait to tell his doctor that he no longer needs medicated cream  he finally has some relief!! Will DEFINITELY buy this again  the entire family uses it now.
557,Kindle Customer,1,30-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,I was looking for a skin moisturizer  upon suggesttions of friends. I found this Cerave  and I love it. I have very sensitive skin and redness on my face. It doesn’t bother my skin and it’s reduced the redness of my skin.
558,S Rhodes,1,11-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,My dematogist told me to try this cream and it s just as good as the expensive high end ones I have tried. I can wear it under my makeup for the day and bed at night. I have been using this for over 2 years with no blemishes.
559,Kayla Van Sandt,1,23-Nov-18,One person found this helpful,I bought this for my boyfriend that I live with because  whenever he gets home for work  he always has chapped hands. All he does is rub a little on his hands and hes good for the rest of the day. I d recommend this to anybody.
560,Ben,1,12-May-19, ,The first time using this product can be daunting. When I first applied it everything was fine  but 24 hours later my face felt EXTREMELY irritated and prickly. It was like a thousand needles pricking at my face constantly. It is a VERY uncomfortable feeling. I thought it was an allergic reaction  but as I ve continued to use it my skin has grown accustomed to it and I no longer feel that intense pain. My skin has grown much softer and plumper. It looks more radiant and spotless. My dry skin has nearly gone away. I would highly recommend this moisturizer if you can get bear through the initial stages as it provides moisture for as long as you need it!
561,cactusroze23,0,01-Feb-18,One person found this helpful,I just used this cream a little while ago  has anyone had any itching issues  I am not using this on my face just my hands  please advise before I return it  only thing I have to watch out for is Lanolin and it doesn t state that it contains that in this product  anyone else have this problem?
562,Ben,1,16-Feb-19, ,In 2009  I was formally diagnoised with dermatitis/dry skin  and was recommended this product by my dermatologist. If  like maybe 5% of people out there  you actually follow the instructions  and use this right after taking a shower  and let it sift into your skin for a while  then it will be very effective and repair damaged skin.
563,Truth be told,1,26-Jun-19, ,Great face lotion!!!!! My husband and I noticed how our skin even plumbed up after just 3 uses. My skin tends to be dry so I loved how moisturizing it is! Not so impressed with the sunscreen version though! It made my already pale red headed hubby look like a ghost lol!
564,Laura,1,18-Apr-19, ,I get this for eczema. It is effective at keeping the skin moisturized  redness down  and itching to a minimum. The cream is thick but rubs in fairly well without feeling greasy. Also good for dry cracked hands in the wintertime. I have purchased this cream more than once.
565,Jess,1,14-Jun-19, ,I love this. I use it every night after taking my makeup off. It is smooth and has a nice feel to it  absorbs into the skin quickly if you don t over-apply  and hasn t made me break out. Would absolutely buy again. I only need a little bit each time  so this will probably last me several more months!
566,Patty,1,26-May-19,One person found this helpful,There is no scent  which is great. I love this cream! My dermatologist recommended it and I have used it ever since.
567,Sidney,0,16-Jan-19, ,I bought this because my skin gets really dry during the winter and I wanted something that could moisturize my skin well enough so I wouldn t have to keep putting on moisturizer all throughout the day.  However after using this for over a week now I found it to not be very helpful. It seems to just sit on top of my skin and dry up leaving residue and it leaves my skin feeling oily and still dry.. I m not sure I m applying enough or too much  even though when applying a little it does nothing when applying more it leaves a lot of residue  I don t feel it s doing anything besides just stitting on top of my skin making it look drier than before..
568,Donna S Magee,1,12-Feb-15,4 people found this helpful,My dermatologist said this is the best moisturizing cream bar none. And he was telling the truth. You put it on your skin and your skin is moist and supple the next day. I have sent some jars of it to people who could not afford it (even though Amazon has a low price) and they LOVED IT! iIt kept their skin moist and no more itching. A real winner. I use it on my face-best face and body cream I have ever used.
569,J. Smith,1,15-Mar-19, ,I had never heard of Cerave until I had a visit consult with my dermatologist. She recommended this lotion to mix with a steroid cream she prescribed to me. It made the combo a nice everyday lotion to use. Highly recommend product. And it s great for those with sensitive skin/noses as there is little to no scent.
570,MKM Lotus,1,16-Oct-18, ,I have been using this for couple of years and it was recommended by our pediatric dermatologist. It works great on the dry  excema skin leaving it hydrated. I found at time i have to use CeraVe and then lock it in with a layer of Vaseline to be more effective. overall great product and it really works in calming itchy skin and hydrating it.
571,The K Man,1,10-Dec-18, ,I am overjoyed that Cera Ve finally offers a protective seal on the 19 oz size! In the past  the lotion was just exposed under the lid. Anyone could have twisted off the lid and breathed into the lotion  stuck their finger in or did who knows what else! Bugs could have even gotten in and pupated in there! Then  I was expected to just use the lotion on my face  hands and thighs (aka  the area adjacent to my happy zone) - NO WAY! Now with the protective seal  I can use the lotion without a worry. And it is great lotion! Really smooths out rough  dry  cracked skin. A little goes a long way. At last  I can be smooth AND confident! Win!
572,D Taylor,1,03-Jun-19, ,Love this product  I use it on my face and body. I have dry skin and it works wonders. But do not use on skin that’s too dry (chapped  broken skin) as the hyaluronic acid will sting unbearably! I use this with Curology topical medication and the Skin Clearing Serum Vitamin C+ from Eva Naturals and drink Vital Protein’s collagen daily and my skin’s never been so clear and bouncy! I’ve gotten compliments on my skin which has never happened. So glad to have found a moisturizer that actually moisturizes. But you only need a really small amount on your face!
573,Caitlin Sims,1,17-Jan-17,One person found this helpful,This moisturizer is simply amazing. I have tried several other products from several brands  and this is my holy grail. I can put other moisturizers on and hours later my skin looks tired and VERY dry and dull. This formula lasts all day long and is very creamy and thick. It does not have a smell  and sinks in very quickly. The tub is gigabtic so you definitely get your money s worth. You can apply makeup 10 minutes after putting it on (which is huge for a time constrained non-morning person like myself). I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive or dry skin. It is truly a life saver!
574,Jenny,1,08-Sep-15,3 people found this helpful,i finally decided to get this product after reading the raving reviews. I love love love  how thick it goes on  but my skin seems to absorb everything! i have super sensitive acne prone skin and have yet to break out from this product. there is so much product in this tub! i use a tiny spatula to get the product out and use this daily morning and night. my skin is healthy and moisturized now!
575,Another Tigger,1,06-Mar-18, ,This is one heck of a moisturizer! My daughter who suffers from dry skin told me about it. (Her walk-in clinic told her about it.) I use it on my husband s feet  which have a genetic problem causing massive callouses which eventually crack and bleed. This is a workhorse of a cream and it has done the job of keeping his feet soft (not easy!). Yet it soaks right in and is NOT greasy!
576,City to Mountain,1,28-Apr-19, ,Finally found something for our 1 year old’s skin to help her dryness. No matter what moisturizer we tried it seemed like her skin would either get worse or stay the same. It was on the trunk of her body. Finally  finding this and using this has significantly helped! We’re on our 3rd bottle.
577,judyB53,1,28-Feb-19, ,This is cream not lotion. A little goes a long way. Pump lid from my old 16 oz jar fits on this 19oz jar. I had used this b4  but was told that for my fairly new condition  to use this only (on my legs and feet). Dr had mentioned 2 other brands but I wasn t familiar with the names.
578,Alyona,1,01-Jan-19, ,I have a very sensitive skin and I tried so many products and spent so much money. I like this one so far. It doesn t irritate my skin and no red spots. When I come out of the shower or when I wash my face  my skin is super dry and begins to peel.This product has been good so far!
579,Travis,1,07-Jan-19, ,A total game changer! This moiturizing cream feels heavy when you first put it on  but sinks in and has a matte finish. I even wrar it under my foundation and a little but goes a long way. I have oily/acne prone skin that was dehydrated and angry on the surface. My skin has totally changed since I started using this cream. Plump  calm and healthy!
580,RaiderNation,0,27-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,It s just ok. Has helped with my dry skin  but it s supposed to be fragrance free and it still has a slight smell to it.

583,Redrady1,1,14-Nov-18, ,The thing I love about this cream the most is that it s perfect to wear in the cold weather and not to heavy in the warm weather to make your face sweat. Perfect alone or under makeup. I actually double-dot it under my eyes for an extra highlight coloring. Highly recommend this product.
584,j wrock,1,08-Sep-13,2 people found this helpful,ive been suffering for eczema on my hands for nearly 10 years. working in the food industry does not makes this any easier. i have used cortizone cream for years but ive read about how bad it is for your hands long term. i recently stumbled upon this product  and oh wow. this stuff was amazing first use  you can feel it lock in the moisture right away. it dries really quick (i use it on my hands). and it creates somewhat of a barrier that actually feels like it locks in  unlike other lotions i have used.  overall  this product has surpassed whatever expectations i had for it. if anyone suffers from eczema  i highly recommend this product  you will NOT be disappointed.
585,Grandma66is,1,20-Apr-18,2 people found this helpful,This brand was recommended by my dermatologist for dry skin. I use it everyday and love the results-smooth skin.
586,S.K.M,1,24-Jul-18, ,Great daily moisturizer that I have made one of my staples in my face regimen. It doesn’t leave an oily feeling and absorbs into skin very well. It doesn’t have a very strong smell but does have a mild medicated scent. After I wash my face  I apply toner  serum/face oil and CeraVe moisturizer. Highly recommend for daily use!
587,Jacki B.,1,18-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,To me  this is the BEST lotion on the market  I have Sjogren s and so have very dry skin  this helps so much. I apply after shower or bath  works wonderful!
588,Kai,0,23-Feb-18, ,I feel like this forms a layer on my skin rather than absorbing properly. I initially bought it when my Pond s Rejuveness ran out  intending to use it on my face  but when that didn t work out I switched to using it as a body moisturizer. It still feels like it s not doing much  though  so I m probably going to have to mix it in with another lotion until I use it all up. I m definitely regretting not getting it in a smaller size.
589,Sarah K.,1,09-Feb-18, ,Felt compelled to review this stuff...it was an absolute miracle worker on my 5 month old’s eczema! Literally cleared it COMPLETELY within 3 days. I tried several other lotions and creams (Aveeno  Eucerin  etc.) before purchasing this one and nothing else even touched it. Definitely worth the price  I’m now a true believer in this CeraVe cream  will purchase again for sure!
590,Rachael Ailshie,1,16-May-19, ,Before I got this I was struggling with dry skin. This makes your face feel so much better after the first use and now that I ve been using it a few weeks my skin feels amazing. This is a good brand I bought the face wash too and just as happy!
591,candace chavez,1,07-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,I have only used this moisturizing cream for about a week and a half and I have to say  it has been amazing for my skin! Fall/winter usually takes a toll on my skin and makes it very dry. From day one of using it  i could already tell a difference. It doesn t leave you feeling greasy. It s great for sensitive skin  as it has no fragrance. I use it at least once a day but really try to use it twice a day. My skin has done a complete turnaround!
592,Tayla Moore,1,06-Jan-17,2 people found this helpful,Aveeno HAS NOTHING on this CeraVe cream. I m telling you I have eczema and KP. I ve lived in both humid and dry climates and this ALWAYS keeps my skin hydrated and smooth. Great lotion AND the price on amazon is WAY lower than in stores. If you buy this as frequently as I do then get it here! Great purchase  trust me.
593,AmznShpr,1,26-Apr-19, ,I live in a dry climate and you have to use lotion or your skin will be very dry. My face is especially dry  I decided to give this a try because my other moisturizer wasn’t great. This lasts all day  my skin feels great and it’s no longer dry and itchy.
594,Mary P. Anderson,1,25-Mar-16,2 people found this helpful,I read about this product in a magazine while getting my hair done. The article was about how creams are so much better for dry skin than lotions. This product was recommended so I decided to try it. Bought it in my local store initially and absolutely love it! It isn t greasy at all and really helps my skin. Even my partner has commented on how much softer my skin is. I recommended this to my 85- year old mother and she also loves it. And my father started using it too! I m on my second tub as I use it after every shower/bath. Even if you don t have dry skin  this product is a must!
595,Rebekah,1,26-Feb-19, ,This is the bet lotion for my kids dry skin! With a long dry winter and swim classes weekly I have kiddos that need good lotion and this is it!! I have tried so many others and this one is the best! It does not have a strong odor and works so well my kids ask for it every night!
596,KJ,1,28-Jan-19, ,I have combinatiin skin  which makes it hard to find a moisturizer that doesn t dry or break me out. This is ome of the best overall moisturizers. I only use it for my face and hands  and love how it leavea my skin. Due keep in mind this cream is a little on the thick side.
597,William M.,1,21-Jun-19, ,Rubs in quickly  and feels good - doesn t linger on the skin  soaks in very quickly. Leaves skin soft and smoother and make natural color deepen. I even rub it in my scalp - no dandruff  and no rub-off on a pillow. It s the BEST!
598,italianmama,1,23-May-19, ,I use Cetaphil wash on my face  and I use this one twice daily and it’s absolutely wonderful! I am a senior citizen and all Italian and this makes my skin glow. It is non-greasy and it feels wonderful I have hyper sensitive skin.
599,Christopher Latson,1,13-Oct-16,One person found this helpful,Great moisturizes that was recommended by my Dermatologist. The cream works a little better than the lotion as I feel it stays on thicker  which is especially important during those cold winter months. It is moisturizes and soothes the skin. If you have excessive dry skin or eczema  this will be your new best friend. It also doesn t have a strong scent  so no need to worry fellas.
600,gariam,1,23-Jan-19, ,I ve been using this for a number of years and have it on a monthly subscription. I ve always had dry skin so  cream  is the only that works. It keeps my skin moist and most importantly I don t have that urge to scratch or itch when using this cream.
601,Stella,1,01-Feb-19, ,We all have dry skin and bouts with eczema  especially in the winter. This cream is the only thing we use  and it works so well! It s gentle  so the kids use it too  with no problems. I want to get this formula in smaller containers for portability.
602,Beckeyz,1,30-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,Good value. Comes in a huge tub. Its a thick moisturizing cream with good ingredients. Compare the ingredients of this and the CeraVe much more expensive eye cream and you will see how valuable this is.
603,TERiyaki,0,22-May-19, ,I am kinda disappointed with this moisturizer because i thought it will really moisturize my skin since it’s a little bit pricey and coming from known brand but i am not satisfied at all. There’s feeling of dryness whenever i use it
604,Jonathan,1,25-Mar-19, ,I ve been using CeraVe for as long as I can remember. As a kid my skin was always very dry and would flake and peal and then start bleeding. My grandma got me CeraVe to use every-time I washed my hands and to put all over my body after the shower. It has worked miracles. My skin doesn t burn after a long day  it stays healthy and moisturized even after 24 hours of wear. The cream is thick  and one tube usually can last me an entire month of showers.
605,Kae,0,27-Feb-19, ,And why I proceeded to use it is honestly beyond my comprehension. This is too thick for my liking  so it doesn t provide the moisture I need  and it also burns my skin. I personally wouldn t recommend this product even though it s really popular
606,GMC,1,08-Oct-18, ,My combination skin can develop eczema patches when it s really dry (yay) to the point where I used to have to treat with a prescription ointment. This  though  is amazing. My skin is moisturized without being greasy. An extra dollop on an angry dry  red patch that would normally result in an eczema flare-up takes care of it. Love this product!
607,George Janeiro,1,13-Mar-19, ,In these cold  dry winter days  my skin gets uncomfortably and noticeably dry. I tried CeraVe for the first time and it provided immediate  long-lasting relief. I will definitely be buying this again  and I hope they offer a travel size.
608,PatrishaVenegas,1,04-Jun-19, ,I love this. It’s helped my face so much. My complexion and skin is so soft and smooth . I only use a cleanser  this cream and sunblock and this moisturizer has changed the way my skin looks. I sometimes use it after a burn or scrape has healed but I still have the scarring or mark and it helps to diminish the look of it.
609,Elizabeth Nicholson,1,18-Nov-17, ,Non-greasy  oil free moisturizer. I use this on the drier parts of my combo skin with the Cerave PM lotion. Like the AM lotion  I’ve found that despite a great formula  it’s not quite as hydrating as I want.  I have yet to find a better alternative as I can’t tolerate oils and heavy silicones  so for now I’ll stick with Cerave. It doesn’t break me out and it at least helps.
610,Wayne,1,13-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,Rich  creamy and very moisturizing. It isn t as thick as other products and so we were surprised how CereVe rids dry skin and keeps skin moist for at least 24 hours. So nice.
611,Terrie B,1,21-Feb-15,2 people found this helpful,This is a great moisturizing cream especially if you suffer from Rosacea like I do. It does not aggravate my skin and keeps it soft. Does it take care of wrinkles.......??? who knows. When you have Rosacea and have to deal with the flareups associated with Rosacea  getting rid of wrinkles is the least of your worries. It moisturizes great  does not cause additional blemishes  and comes in a big jar so you don t have to keep reordering. I would highly recommend. My dermatologist recommended.
612,Lisa,1,03-Jun-19, ,This cream has been excellent for combating dry skin  cracking heals  and chapped hands. There is not much of an odor. I would say it s neutral. It absorbs well without being greasy. I have been applying to feet  hands  and legs about every other day. I expect the entire container to last 6 weeks.
613,colleen5531,1,25-Apr-18,2 people found this helpful,This is my all-time favorite body moisturizer. I use it daily--it s perfection.
614,Michelle Vu,1,24-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,This is one of the best moisturizing creams of all time! It heals very quickly  and it feels unlike any other lotions out there. Your hands feel funny if you wash them after you put this one. I highly recommend this high-quality product.
615,M.M.,1,25-Oct-15,One person found this helpful,I have severe dermatitis on my palms and soles of my feet (it has been diagnosed as eczema and psoriasis or a combination) since about 2011. I have been through more than 10 prescriptions and use of over the counter tars  oils  lotions  and creams targeted at psoriasis or eczema or dry skin. Nothing works for me like applying CeraVe 2-3 times per day (the cream  not the thinner lotion in the tall pump bottle). My skin no longer cracks and bleeds. It has not healed my condition (as it returns without use of the cream)  but it allows me to manage it my symptoms and resume the lifestlye I had before this condition started. I no longer have to be embarassed to have someone see my palms or shake my hands  and I attribute it largely to CeraVe.
616,Jenny GIbson,1,06-Jun-19, ,I love the stuff. I use it with their face wash and it works wonders. I use the face wash and then the moisturizer before I go to bed and I wake up with my face and skin feeling amazing. I also have a patch of dry skin near my thigh  that s been there for years and recently started getting worse. I use this on it twice a day. I ve only been using it about a week  but the dry patch is almost totally gone. I highly recommend.
617,Maria,1,21-May-18,One person found this helpful,I love CeraVe. It is a great daily moisturizer for people with very dry skin. if you have excema try this cream. Do a spot test  and if it does not irritate your skin  it will help it.
618,Rebekah Robertts,1,19-Feb-18, ,Really really like this moisturizer. I have been looking for something that doesn’t leave my face greasy afterwards but at the same time that gives lots of moisture to my face. I’m probably sticking to it now that I found it! One thing though is when you use toner and then the moisturizer it might sting a little  so I would wait a little before applying.
619,R.S.,1,07-Jun-15, ,One of the best moisturizing creams I have used. This keeps my skin soft and moisturized in all seasons and does not feel greasy once it dries. No more elbows that feel like sand paper! It has a light aroma that does not linger. I can use it on my face as well as hands  arms  legs  and feet if I like. It was also recommended by my dermatologist as one of the better creams to use and doctor approved. The 16 ounce jar lasts quite a while. I initially learned about CeraVe from a Delta flight attendant who used it to keep her skin from getting dried out on flights. Bottom line: IT WORKS!
620,Julianne Bryson,1,10-Sep-17,2 people found this helpful,Best moisturizer ever! My dermatologist uses this  said it really protects your skin and there s no scent. Its clean of tons of additives and chemicals and is so smooth. You can use it as a carrier for essential oils as well. Amazon has the best price ($5 less than most other big sellers) at least as of now.
621,mtlgal,1,15-Nov-17, ,Really effective moisturizing cream for the face  hands & body. I have very sensitive skin but this one did not irritate or cause my face to break out (unlike most other facial moisturizers). The cream gets absorbed well  doesn t leave you with a greasy feeling  and your hands and face feel moisturized for quite a while after it s been applied. It even wears well under makeup.
622,KNICOLE,1,14-Jan-18, ,I have searched for years for a product like this. I use the CeraVe foaming facial cleanser  witch hazel toner and this and my skin has never been better. Its leaves my skin soft and refreshed and doesn’t feel dried out or feel like I used harsh chemicals on my skin. Something so simple and inexpensive turned out to be the best thing!
623,Amber,1,24-Nov-18, ,Could feel a huge difference in just one use & by 3 days my face had made a complete turn around. I have such bad dry skin in the winter I can’t even wear foundation because you can see the dry skin underneath! Now my skin is so hydrated and soft I don’t even have to worry.
624,Amazon Customer,1,19-Oct-18, ,Doctor recommended this?it solved all my skin issues  itchiness  scabs  gives  irritation  redness  dryness. Gone. My grandpa’s doctor gave him this same recommendation. Amazing for everyone. You can even use it as a Fac? cream. I swear by CeraVe skin products.
625,Rachel,1,16-Jun-19, ,This stuff is the best. My face always feels moisturized. My skin is generally pretty clear  but the few zits that I get have lessened since I ve been using this for the past few months (and it s great on the rest of my body in a pinch). Would buy again  if I ever run out :)
626,Zachary Gough,1,22-Feb-19, ,I normally don t leave a ton of reviews  but holy crap this stuff is amazing!!! I had dry skin on my face  turned red and would flake  and tried EVERY expensive  dermatologist recommended  lotion that existed  until I found this. No more dry red flaky skin  and my face feels moisturized all day. I put on simply after taking a shower and my dry skin and redness have completely disappeared!! Miracle product!! Love this!!
627,Allison H,1,01-Mar-19, ,I don t recommend this for your face. It caused mine to break out (with several trials). However  this is GREAT for the rest of your body. It moisturizes wonderfully. I bought this at the recommendation of my dermatologist.
628,Belle B.,1,18-Feb-16,9 people found this helpful,Best moisturizer ever! I use on my body and face. First started using Cerave a few years ago when my daughters dermatologist recommended it for eczema. I have tried almost every cream possible  and this one truly works. This is a nice thick lotion  but is not greasy and absorbs well. It doesn t burn except on open scrapes (any cream will). I now use several Cerave products including the face wash  eye cream  and night cream. The price on Cerave cannot be beat  the secret is the ceramides and hyaluronic acid  which is usually found only in high end products.
629,Arthur,1,14-Apr-19, ,I ve had these dry red rashes on my arms for a while and nothing was helping. I ve only used this cream for a couple of days and have started to see an improvement. I would definitely purchase this again.
630,C Hutch,1,30-Apr-18,2 people found this helpful,No need to spend money on expensive creams. This is rich and absorbs well.
631,Molly Schwarz,1,09-Mar-19, ,I use this as my main moisturizer and oh wow its amazing. Great starter for anyone new to skincare and an unforgettable cream for the professionals. I will for sure keep this product in my household as long as its around.
632,Cruise4Two,1,01-Jun-12,One person found this helpful,This cream is amazing. My 7 yr old had a horrible 2 year eczema nightmare from head to toe. Once we started Cerave (we were living in Australia at the time and it was not sold there so we flew it in)  within days we started seeing a big difference and within 2 months of using it 2x per day  our eczema was 100% gone. I cannot urge parents enough to try this cream. By the way  it did sting his skin for about 30 seconds to 1 minute the first several days  (in the way bactine stings when you spray a booboo)  but I carried on and bribed him with a treat to be cool about it. And after a few days  about the time I actually could see a big difference  it no longer stung on application. Very worth getting through that short uncomfortable time.
633,Janna U.,1,30-Jun-19, ,I love Cerave cream (the lotion  not so much). I use these jars with a pump for easy dispensing. I find Cerave cream to be very moisturizing  but not greasy  and absorbs quickly. Since discovering it a few years ago  I won t use anything else.
634,graneeejaneee,1,11-Apr-19, ,My Dermatologist recommended this for my hands and my while body. It s really a great product and not greasy. I can t stand anything greasy on my body and this cream is wonderful and keeps my skin hydrated as well.
635,E. Thompson,1,12-Apr-19, ,CeraVe cream is a great moisturizer. It helped me throught the winter with my dry skin and with eczema problems. One of the things I like about this cream is that it is not greasy. I really love this cream.
636,NevenaK,1,12-Oct-18, ,A friend recommended this for my one month old with eczema. It worked wonders! I swear by it now and use it on myself as well as a moisturizer. I tried other things like Aqophor (too petroleum jelly-ish) and Aveeno. But only this works! Clears up a breakout within a day!
637,Mike Roberts,1,22-Jan-19, ,I can’t believe how amazing this is! ?????? I just wish I would of tried it sooner! I have rosacea and it makes my face dry and flaky. I’ve spent thousands of dollars trying to make it better  when all I needed was to go on amazon & buy this miracle for $15! I had the worst dry skin and can finally wear makeup & it look good again! Seriously  if you want something that will make a difference but this!
638,Mon,0,31-Mar-18, ,You know  I know this is a good value  but I ve been using this for a while  and I actually really prefer cetaphil moisturizer. This stuff kind of sits on my face and dries; I don t think that it has made a significant improvement in the moisture of my very-dry skin. I also just think that in general  things that come in jars are not sanitary.
639,T-bone,1,01-Jun-19, ,I used to use this only in winter but now use it year-round as my skin has gotten drier. I have dry/combination sensitive skin (due to medication) and this make a nice barrier that is never irritating. Unscented. Lasts forever.
640,BC,1,08-Mar-19, ,I stopped using our other hand and face creams. Seriously fantastic product. Not at all greasy and yet keeps my skin soft and pampered. My husband uses it as well. It is odorless and feels amazing on the skin.
641,Sheldon Clarke,1,21-Apr-19,2 people found this helpful,Make my skin smooth and it also make rash go away.
642,Paul,1,25-Sep-17,One person found this helpful,My skin was always itching  so my doctor recommended this product. It works great. Itching stopped. I never thought I had dry skin ? and maybe I don t? but all I know is that my skin feels great and I m not scratching like I used to.
643,Connie S.,1,23-Jun-19, ,I bought this on referral From my sister in law. She has very sensitive skin and said after many purchases it was the best she had bought. Nice  rich feel. I’m not crazy about odor. After just a week I can tell my very dry skin is improving.
644,Vicki5pan,1,10-Dec-18, ,This cream has been fundamental in improving my little girl’s eczema. It has also improved my extremely itchy skin in a matter of days. Well worth the money and so much better than many of the prescription meds we were prescribed.
645,Meagan,1,17-Jun-19, ,I hate lotions. I can always feel the layer of lotion and I always feel the need to wash my hands later because they feel grime-y to me.  This lotion is miracle-in-a-jar. It actually penetrates my skin and leaves it feeling soft. I no longer have that dry  skin around my heels  hands or elbows.  I use after I get out of the shower and freshly dried off. It s scent free too  which I like. One of the best purchases I have ever made.
646,MBK61805,1,16-Jun-19, ,I like it. It doesn t leave a greasy feel on my skin like some of my wife s lotions. I ve used several containers of it over the last couple years  especially in the winter when my skin gets more dry.
647,Texmaryanne,1,13-Feb-19, ,I ordered this accidentally (meant to order another brand)  but I m glad I did because I love this one! It gives me good moisture without greasiness  and it contains no harmful ingredients. Very mild but highly effective!
648,Big oof,1,01-Jun-19, ,I legit used this on my face night and day because I thought it was a face moisturizer.. oops... I mean it worked.. but i suggest getting CeraVes facial moisturizer if that’s what you want it for lol
649,pkhome,1,12-Nov-18, ,I have tried a lot of different products for my dry skin and this is the best. Really works!! And I like the tub container as opposed to a pump as there is less waste. No throwing it away cuz the pump no longer reaches the lotion.
650,Wen Tsen,1,13-May-19, ,I have Eczema  and this product is perfect for it. I ve been searching for a long time for a product that won t irritate my skin  and I think i ve finally found it. It s dermatologists designed.
651,RomanS,1,05-Apr-15,One person found this helpful,If you have dry skin  this stuff rocks! One of my Co-Workers turned me on to the product. Thankfully its not too greasy after you work it in... And to be honest  they are ALL GREASY to some extent  if its not  then its not really helping your hands. I usually have breakouts on my face if I use a moisturizing product  but I am pretty good with this stuff. Oh one last thing.. perfume usually gives me headaches... this does not have an annoyingly strong smell at all  so it does not annoy me at all.
652,Kori S.,1,23-Dec-18, ,This is my holy grail moisturizer! I m on a high dose of accutane  which leaves you with incredibly dry skin  but thanks to this moisturizer you wouldn t be able to tell. It is thick and doesn t play nice with my make up  so I only use it at night. Despite that and the accutanr  my skin is the most soft and moisturized it s ever been.  My dad also started getting dry  flaky skin around his chin and I gave him some of this to see if it helped and it did!
653,Jessie Jones,1,28-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,I used Cetaphil cream before and this one is much better. It moisturizes and absorbs quickly and doesn t leave your skin feeling greasy. My dermatologist recommended it and I m glad I gave it a try.
654,ML,1,01-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,Great product! I have such dry skin and one use of this product no more dry skin. I use this every day and I love it! The only moisturizer I will ever use!
655,Pam Murphy,1,03-Jul-19, ,My skin is so sensitive and had become so dry since I wasn t able to find anything that didn t make me break out in hives. Finally found CeraVe. I love this stuff and so does my skin.
656,Mjb Ne,1,23-Jan-19, ,My daughter has intense eczema and this is the only over the counter cream she likes to use. It by no means cures her eczema but it does moisturize her skin better than other over the counter creams and doesn’t make her sticky.
657,njk,1,21-Jan-19, ,I have tried many moisturizing creams but CeraVe is by far the best. Used to have itchy  dry skin in the winter but since using this cream it has helped 100%. My husbands back was itching so I started putting it on his back. He now calls it the ‘miracle cream’  lol.
658,Dan K,1,03-Feb-18,One person found this helpful,I have fairly widespread eczema and have tried various other creams with little improvement. My doctor recommended I try the CeraVe moisturizing cream along with a steroid ointment that she prescribed. I have used both for a month and the results have been fantastic. The cream is a bit pricey but worth it. Amazon has the best pricing I have found especially for the 16 oz. size. Most drug stores sell the 12 oz. jar for $14.00 to $15.00 dollars.
659,Michael Lawrence,1,11-Feb-19, ,I love this product. I ve literally purchased about 6-7 different moisturizers looking for the one that works and this is by far one of the best on the markets. My face has revolted against me this winter and it s been super dry  but this is my morning and night moisturizer and it works!
660,M. M,1,21-Jun-19, ,Bought back in October of last year and just finished it today. This cream is so good- a little bit of it goes a long way! If your skin is inflamed  it can be a little irritating but for me that only happened when I went a little hard on the chemical exfoliants. Other than that  this is soothing  and I feel like it locks in all the moisture in my skin for the night. Also used this in the day time on my face during the winter. I m going to try using it as a body moisturizer too and seeing how long it lasts me :>
661,DDD,1,25-Feb-19, ,I use this cream for both my face and body. It has really helped with the texture of my skin as well as extreme dryness. I think it has even helped with fine lines. It is thick and creamy  but does not feel heavy or greasy.
662,Leah Larsen,1,21-Jun-19, ,This product was recommended by a dermatologist for my child’s eczema. Within a week his skin was better and my extremely dry hands were smooth. The skin on my hands is very dry because I’m a nurse so I wash my hands all the time and it’s worse in the dry winter. I love this product!
663,Clare D.,1,17-Aug-15, ,This moisturizer was receommended to me by a friend and now that I ve tried it  I dont know that I ll ever buy anything else. I have only lived in the States for a couple of years so there are a lot of brands I m not familiar with (I say that as a disclaimer because maybe everyone knows about CeraVe here??). I typically opt for frangranced moisturizers but given how beautifully moisturizing this cream is with out any oily residue (and I do like to put it on my legs right before bed so I love that it doesn t  bleed into  the sheets)  I think I m now a CeraVe convert.
664,Mia C,1,02-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,This is incredible I just used it once today and I never felt softer. I can’t even feel the hair on my legs anymore and I needed to shave. Love it!!!
665,AllisonM,1,01-Dec-16, ,Changed my winter skin - recently purchased this and love it. It s thick  but dries without the tackiness. I can apply and put on clothes a few minutes after. I think it s exactly what s needed for the winter months. I have been searching for a  go-to  real moisturizing lotion for years and have tried everything. I love the archipelago line and the scents  but it s so expensive. This is a great product and probably even better for those with sensitive skin (which I don t necessarily have).
666,beckaboard,1,06-Jul-13,2 people found this helpful,Hardly anyone knows what Hyaluronic Acid is  but they should. Stuff is like gold. Pulls moisture from the air like a magnet. Just what the skin needs. As far as my experience goes  you put that in a product and the price goes way up. Not here. The price is totally within reach  especially for such a good product and the amount. After many  MANY years of paying more money for a really good lotion that I ve loved  I am making the switch. I guess my skin is dryer  but going through body lotion like I do these days is killing my wallet. This is a hefty amount and a superb cream.
667,Amazon Customer,1,30-Jan-18, ,I used to have face dandruff in the winter. My skin was so dry and I had tried a number of creams and lotions- nothing had worked. This cream was life changing. The difference was literally night and day. I can now apply makeup on without the flaking. I also apply on my 4 year old niece when she has dry hands. Worked great on the kiddies too!
668,JEK Shopper,1,02-Dec-18, ,I have tried so very many creams to try to help my dry New England skin during the cold weather. This cream is amazing! light and unscented  it goes on smoothly and does not leave your skin feeling greasy. You don t need a ton to get an amazing result. I highly recommend this cream!
669,NW Angler,1,17-Feb-19, ,Excellent cream for dry skin. No adverse skin reactions or irritations. This and Vanicream are two of my favorites for our child with dry skin. Goes on easy and has a non-greasy feel. Highly recommended!
670,Autumn,1,03-Jul-19, ,Tried different creams this one was recommended by some lady at a store heard me complaining about nothing works with my skin  as what that nice lady said it was recommended by her doctor and won’t cause allergy and feels good.
671,A. Little,1,16-Apr-19, ,I have some patches of skin that occasionally get severely dry and raw. Cerave cream works better than any other cream I have tried. Does not heal the skin completely  but still the best over the counter skin moisturizer out there in my opinion
672,Erik J,1,20-Jun-19, ,Living in a dry state it s hard to keep skin feeling moisturized. My wife is also breastfeeding and this made her hands hurt from being so dry. This hasn t been an issue since getting this moisturizer.
673,kami Davidson,1,24-Oct-18, ,We have tried soooooooo many things for my 1yr old daughters eczema. This works the best. She scratches until her poor little ankle bleeds and this is the only thing that has helped it heal.  Gold Bond eczema relief is also very helpful though. FYI
674,Amazon User 84,1,13-Jun-18, ,Nice thick  lots of it and great price! What more can you ask for? I have sensitive skin and this stuff really works! It s awesome for colds when your nose is dry and peeling.. it s helped my skin out lots where I don t have to go to a dermatologist
675,alewis1227,1,17-Jul-13, ,I have very dry skin  so I have to use moisturizer after every time I cleanse my face. Many common moisturizers don t do enough for my skin and I get dry patches around my mouth/chin area. I was previously using Clinique s Dramatically Different Moisturizer which I liked  but at $25 a bottle was on the hunt for a better/cheaper alternative. And I ve found it in Cerave!  I love the consistency of this product. Not greasy at all!! I can apply makeup 5 minutes after applying this to my face and only need a little product to cover my entire face. I am so happy they offer this product in a travel size for a decent price. Thanks amazon!
676,FPK,1,21-Sep-18, ,my daughter suffers from chronic eczema and the dermatologist has recommended this. she uses it faithfully over face and body  it can cause some breakouts but does the jobs at locking in moisture and keeping skin hydrated.
677,Amazon Customer,1,16-Sep-16,One person found this helpful,The best ever! Recommended by my dermatologist and she was right. I use all CeraVe products now with no  reactions  except very moisturized skin. Now the whole family uses it...no perfumes or scent to interfere with any of your other scents. I use none  so I am happy to have a product that does not smell!
678,bruna lass,1,02-Jan-19, ,Bought this to replace a small jar of expensive face cream that I was using for years  even tho this cream is 40 dollars cheaper than what used before I found it to actually be better for my skin  super mosturizing.
679,Laura H Haffield,1,28-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,I have pretty terrible and dry skin and I was hoping this would replace my multi-step lotion routine. I love the consistency  but wish it had a more nourishing moisture to it as it seems to soak in fast and leave my skin feeling a little dry still. I may need to try a more heavy duty product from this brand.
680,Kelly Ann Gallo,1,19-Mar-18, ,It made my skin hydrated and soft. I just wasn t a fan of how thick it was or the smell  but that is a cream for you. The quantity for the price cannot be beat. If you re looking for a moisturizing cream on a budget  this is the one for you. It could last you a year with daily use.
681,Leslie41,1,15-Sep-14,3 people found this helpful,My doctor wanted to put me on yet another pill for my eczema. I m on enough medications  so I thought before I went that route  I d try something topical. I had a rash on my wrist for three months  and it wasn t getting better. A couple of weeks of putting this cream on morning and night and the rash is gone. The silvery-sheeny  scale  is gone.  This is a miracle cream  seriously.
682,Alice,1,17-Aug-18, ,This cream works well for use on the face and every area of your body. Super for sensitive skin. The jar says it s good for Eczma and I agree completely. My skin is much better since I started using it. No more need for harmful prescriptions.
683,EzDaisy,1,03-Dec-18, ,We love this moisturizer very non-scented. Keep it right next to the shower kits applied every day nice and it goes right on the face also ! We think we like this better than the pump is easier to apply
684,Savvy,1,23-Apr-19, ,I’ve always had oily skin but I went through a period of time where I had very dry skin and didn’t know how to deal with it  one of buzzfeed’s skin care blogs brought me to this moisturizer and my skin is so thankful
685,mkysay,1,14-Jun-18,4 people found this helpful,This cream was recommended to me by our pediatrician after seeing my son’s eczema. We told him we used Aquaphor and that it helped  but the doc said that it doesn’t do much to help moisturize the skin and to try this out as well. We added this to our son’s regimen and it definitely helped! We lather it on immediately after the bath and also apply it a couple other times a day. Now  his skin that once felt scaly now feels so smooth and soft to the touch... what is implied when people refer to  baby skin . Now we’re on our second jar of this. We bought the version with a pump the first time so I kept the pump and use it on this second jar now.
686,Da di di do du,1,21-Mar-12,One person found this helpful,I have to admit that I wasn t surprised that my 3 year old has eczema considering her daddy is also prone to that condition. Read the good reviews here and tried this cream not only for myself but for my daughter as well. This cream worked wonders and is one of the cheapest alternatives I have used. Our flare outs if not cleared the following day  diminished considerably. I am definitely amazed and a believer. Now I realized that it doesn t need a full blown advertisement for a product to be good. Nice for the reviewers here in Amazon  I was able to find a worthy product. Now going to the hard task of persuading the wife to let go of her expensive creams...
687,Once Around,1,06-Sep-13, ,Amazingly  this is uber-mild  unscented  and does not irritate or break out my skin in any shape or form. It is a large tub. When I ran out  I tried a similar-looking tub from my local drug store  and noticed my skin was appearing very dull. That product was thicker and heavier. After a month or so  I finally realized that I look so much better/healthier when using the CeraVe. Couldn t find it locally  so came to Amazon. So happy to find it here  and at a good price- like I mentioned  it is a large tub. I use it daily/nightly on my face  and sometimes also on the body (though I have other potions I use). Feels rather light going on  but keeps my skin moisturized  very mild  no scent. Love it!
688,Amazon Customer,0,09-May-19, ,This is not the same as what s sold in stores. It doesn t have the extended moisturizing ingredients as the store item. I only use on my arms  feet & legs. A couple of hours after the shower  my skin is dry as if I never applied any cream at all.
689,Brittany,1,12-Dec-16,5 people found this helpful,This has become my go to facial moisturizer. I followed the advice of other reviewers and didn t spend the extra money on the special  face  lotion and I m so glad. Now that it is winter I slather this all over my face every night and it doesn t make me break out. I even used this (though in thinner applications) over the summer and it was a life saver. No matter what type of skin you have  I m coming around to the realization that breakouts are due to your skin producing oils/sebum to make up for all the stuff we strip out with harsh detergents. By applying this immediately after washing my face  I feel that I m telling my body I got the moisture covered and preventing it from going into overdrive with bad oils. But I m not a scientist  so don t take my word for it. lol
690,Doug Simpson,1,10-Sep-17,One person found this helpful,Seems to work on my eczema dried hands for a while but I think it s usefulness has worn off as the dryness and itchiness returns quickly. For some reason it works better on my feet than my hands. Good product overall.
691,G Termin,1,28-May-18,One person found this helpful,I love this moisturizer. I am older and suffer from dry skin and it does the job butter than anything else I have tried.
692,marilyn m.,1,12-Mar-14, ,After years of hearing about it  I took the plunge and ordered this bad boy. It is pricey  yeah  but when people say  The big tub of CeraVe   they are not exaggerating about the size. I think this will take at least a couple of years to get through  to be honest. So it s actually much cheaper than the smaller tubs I d buy every 6 months or year. I chose the cream over the regular lotion because surprisingly  this cream is said to be more mattifying than the lotion  and I tend to get oily skin  so that s important for me. However  I think this is a great moisturizer for anyone  not just someone worried about oily skin problems. The scent is light and it goes on easily and spreads well.
693,Shannon,1,10-May-19, ,After four months of using it  I definitely see a difference. It is extremely moisturizing and very light weight. It is great on my dry patches  but since I have combination skin (oily T-zone and dry cheeks)  it has started to be a bit too oily in my t-zone during the hotter days. I will definitely keep this as a staple in my routine and it’s a great night moisturizer  but if you have oily skin  I would try a gel moisturizer over this one.
694,Amazon Customer,1,24-Oct-18, ,I have used this product for many years to help with my eczema flare ups. This is perfect for skin that needs to really stay hydrated. I love that it is unscented and super thick. The tub always lasts for a long time.
695,K.Y.,1,25-Aug-17, ,This cream is great.It is really moisturising and you can t beat the price.I have tried many creams some that are really expensive but this is the best.I also use Creave face wash PM and AM face creams and the eye cream.This brand has good stuff in their products and they work really well and the prices are fair.
696,J. Byerly,1,22-Feb-14,2 people found this helpful,This was recommended by a dermatologist for skin issues. My father (88 yrs old) has very delicate  thin skin and is diabetic. He was really having problems with skin tears on his arms  itching  general irritation. Within just a few days  the itching seemed to be relieved and his skin is looking much better. Other family members have now tried it and are also very happy with the results. It is a little pricey  but you get what you pay for. This is the best moisturizer we have found.
697,Lizzy,1,12-Jun-19, ,My boyfriend and I have super sensitive skin and we are both allergic to fragrance. I have oily skin and I use this day and night after cleansing. This moisturizer is amazing. Also  if you get sun burnt  stick this baby in the fridge and moisturize with this. No need for the aloe. The size of the tub is also great  they don’t have this big size in Target where I normally shop. Reallly good bang for buck.
698,Meghana Raja,1,29-Jan-18, ,This stuff is amazing! I ve been looking for a great  intense moisturizer for my picky skin and had been through a bunch of the big names. This is my favorite because it s easy to apply  but still very rich and moisturizing for my skin  and it doesn t leave a slimy or oily residue.
699,STT,1,20-Feb-15,2 people found this helpful,This lotion is awesome on my face. All though I must admit I do feel a little dryness after I put it on my face  I still use it because it has transformed my face. I am sensitive to some ingredients but this moisturizer agrees with me. I also put it on my kids face and it works for them too. A little goes a long way and there is no greasy feel later. One jar lasts a year and Amazon has the best price.
700,Kia,1,16-May-19, ,Haven t tried it as yet but it arrived early  bigger than I thought  excellent package didn t spilled and it absolutely worth the money. Will give further reviews once I tried it
701,Tulip,1,13-Dec-18, ,This lotion is thick  meaning a little goes a very long way  but it isn t heavy or greasy in the slightest! I ll never use another lotion for my face/neck ever again. I m in love and forever a brand loyalist to CeraVe.
702,D. Nakpil,1,10-May-18,One person found this helpful,Sooo hydrating  it is a great help to my tretinoin treated skin. I use it under the tret as a buffer  and then again on top to seal. Voila! Beautiful hydrated skin!
703,SM,1,05-Apr-19, ,My daughters have sensitive and dry skin  this moisturizer works wonders for them! Doesn t make skin greasy  absorbs quickly  and cures dry/flakey skin overnight.
704,MelissaAmber,1,04-Jul-18, ,I am on Accutane and this has been a godsend for my face. I use it at night and in the morning under makeup. Absorbs really well. I know I probably wouldn t be able to use this if I weren t on the accutane  but really great for dry flaky skin.
705,Amazon Customer,1,13-Feb-18, ,Seen huge improvements already in dry skin areas. Personally don t even have to apply daily. Before this product I would constantly have dry skin (nose and elbows) but with this product I wake up with smooth  moist skin. Makes me curious as to what other brands used because nothing ever worked  or not for long. If you are constantly getting dry skin in specific areas  for most of your life  I recommend trying this out. So far longest I didn t have to apply for was 3 days after using it daily/every other for a week.
706,James joo,1,05-Dec-18, ,I have been using this product on my daughters skin for the last seven months  and it has been amazing for her eczema. I put it on very consistently every night and this is the first product that I can use exclusively without trying to find three or four different things to use at a time. Her skin is soft and has very few eczema outbreaks.
707,J Perry,1,14-Jun-19, ,It s very good at keeping the skin moist kind of like a this layer of Vaseline only not as slippery maybe? It s good for the winter when my skins really dry
708,Amazon Customer,1,03-Oct-18, ,This is a wonderful fragrance free lotion that my dermatologist recommended when I had a severe case of psoriasis my psoriasis is gone and I continue to use it. It is greaseless and fast absorbing. If you like a fragrance you can add essential oil‘s to the lotion to give it a scent.
709,DebbM,1,13-Jun-18, ,No matter how much water I drink  my arms are about as smooth as an alligator’s ... until now. CeraVe is not at all greasy  penetrates immediately and the texture of my skin is visibly less creased and more sleek. This is great stuff.
710,RowingRef,1,20-Feb-19, ,CeraVe is the best moisturizing cream on the market today. You do not have to use a lot of it to make a big difference for your skin; its effect on your face and hands is wonderful.
711,Julie,1,29-Jul-18, ,This product is absolutely incredible for my elbows and heels! I love that my skin immediately soaks it up  and it doesn’t leave a greasy residue. It cost more than regular lotion  so I save it for my driest parts. It’s excellent!
712,Toni Floerchinger,1,10-Mar-19, ,I love this product for face and body. Not greasy  not heavy and a little goes a long way. I have aged skin and everyone tells me I look great and asks what I use.
713,Maddy,1,12-Jan-19, ,I was a little iffy about buying this but I love trying new products so I went ahead and bought it and I’m so glad I did! I use as a FULL body moisturizer (face and body) I’m not joking when I say I feel like silk and it does matify your face if you have oily skin  so yes...BUY THIS! YOU WONT REGRET IT!
714,Sandy,1,15-Jul-18, ,I have very dry skin (eczema) and this helps! The lotion is very moisturizing  but not greasy. It soaks into the skin pretty quickly. I definitely recommend this for dry skin on your body or hands. I use on my feet  legs  arms and hands.
715,Liz Hailand,1,04-Apr-15,One person found this helpful,This is my second time buying this lotion. The first time my doctor had recommended it to me  and that tub lasted me a whole year  applying at least every morning and sometimes at night. It s very thick and moisturizing  but absorbs quickly also  meaning you can put it on and then apply makeup 5-10 minutes later without any issue. It s also non-irritating to my sensitive skin  even when my skin is raw feeling from topical acne products.
716,Doreen P,1,07-Jun-19, ,This stuff is superior to everything out there. Since using it on my daughters skin for eczema  her skin hasn’t been hurting or having any dry patches!
717,Ruins,1,08-Oct-14, ,I switched to this after using Aveeno for many years. Seems my skin decided to start reacting to the other product. At my dermatologists recommendation  I tried this product. I like it. While it s definitely a cream  it goes on easily and does not feel greasy. It doesn t dry quite as quickly as the Aveeno did but I like it so far. My skin feels less dry; I only wish they made the product in bulk so I could try it as a body lotion. A little does go a long way but it s a bit pricy for more than the face to me.  The Matrix Biolage 16oz pump fit quite well as other uses have testified to.

719,A. Smith,1,15-Jan-18, ,I ve been using this cream on my toddler s eczema for about a week  and there is a noticeable difference in his skin. He is much less red and rashy  less itchy  and his skin feels soft. Even his hands and face are healing well  and those are tricky places for a toddler with eczema because of how wet they often are. I have an older child with a patch of eczema on her wrist  and she noticed a difference in her skin after using this cream once. We ll be stocking up.
720,nancy,1,27-Feb-19, ,this cream is pricey but I m Latina and tan complexion and have dry skin. This cream will keep my none ashy all day. It isn t greasy so I dont  have to worry about stains.
721,Kathleen T. Henson,1,17-May-19, ,I live in Denver Colorado where it is very dry. My face was looking very dry and was itchy and I was going nuts. Three weeks of this cream and my skin looks much better.
722,calico27,1,05-Jun-18, ,I got it for my 4month old daughter who has constant dry skin. It works great!! It is light  applies well and her skin instantly started improving. And while applying it on her  I realized they feel like a great hand cream on me too!
723,Michelle W.,1,09-Nov-18, ,Love this cream. Use it for my face and whole body. Hubby just started using it for his face as well and loves it. I was using oil of olay before on my face and this is so much cheaper. You get 10x as much.
724,judyB53,1,28-Feb-19, ,Real thick. This is cream not lotion. Don t need to put alot on your skin. A little goes a long way. Really moisturizes. Actually used it (with pump) b4 Dr recommended it.
725,Sue,1,13-Jan-19, ,This is my favorite lotion. It’s thick but dries fairly quickly. You can totally see a difference in your skin texture hue next morning. Incredibly hydrating. I love cereve products.
726,Megan,0,29-Jan-18,6 people found this helpful,UPDATE: It s causing serious break-outs on my cheeks now  and redness that has lead to severe irritation. I have to stop using it on my face now  which was the reason I purchased it.

729,AmazonFan,1,05-Jan-17, ,Best cream on the market in this girl s opinion. One application last DAYS even with hot shower water beating down on you. NOT greasy at all. But obviously nourishing to skin  which comes back to looking normal no matter HOW dry and scaly it is when this is applied. I gave out 9 or 10 of these jars to the family ladies this Christmas. Best stuff. Ever!
730,Amazon Customer,1,17-Feb-19, ,I can’t live without this now that my Doctor recommend this product by CeraVe. No scent  thick cream and keeps me smooth head to toe. When you have diabetic dry skin like mine  you need to jump into this tub of moisture!
731,Meg R,1,20-Mar-18, ,This was recommended by a dermatologist I follow on YouTube. It helps restore the moisture barrier. It’s pretty thick  but absorbs well. I have very sensitive skin  and it doesn’t irritate me. It even works well on my baby’s sensitive skin.
732,oopsie14,1,03-Jul-19, ,Used this for my baby s eczema! Saw a noticeable difference after 24 hours. With consistent use several times a day it s now completely gone. We were using aquaphor religiously before and it didn t do anything. Thank God for this lotion.
733,N.,0,09-Dec-17, ,To be honest  it never feels like it s doing anything. It gets absorbed into the skin (I guess as a plus  it s not greasy)  and it s like I never applied it - my skin still feels dry  and consistent use doesn t show sign of improved skin hydration. I gave up using it.
734,Natalie Wonder,1,20-Jun-17, ,I love CeraVe. I use this on my face and it works great. I have oily skin and I break out often. This CeraVe cream calms my skin down and seems to heal up my acne much quicker. It also seems to give my face a glow. I ve used other expensive face products and I keep going back to this one. I use it on my body too.
735,Amazon Customer,1,12-Nov-18, ,Effective moisturizer  I even use it on my face. Will purchase again  decent price and amount of product. I’ve done my homework  this has proven beneficial skincare ingredients.
736,Jenna,1,11-Sep-14,5 people found this helpful,Love this stuff! I use it for my son who has very bad eczema  my infant daughter  and myself.

737,Dbear,1,16-Apr-19, ,I have dry skin due to medications I take  and this is one of the best lotions I’ve tried. It soaks into my skin quickly and doesn’t feel greasy.
738,Dayna Russo,1,07-Mar-18, ,Tried this for the first time today  it feels amazing. Can’t speak to the long term effects obviously. But it’s thick cream  and it absorbs so well into the skin. My face feels so soft  and not oily at all. Definitely moisturizing as well!
739,Sarah Parrott,1,15-Jun-19, ,My dermatologist recommended Cerave cream a few years ago. I ve used it since. It is moisturizing  helps my dry skin  & helps prevent eczema breakout.
740,Jac Jay,1,29-Jun-19, ,Saved my skin! It is the best facial Moisturizer and rest of my skin moisturizer. Doesn’t break me out and keeps my skin so soft.
741,C. Castillo,0,21-May-19, ,i bought this for face moisturizer since i have dry skin. i lucky didnt get a break out but didnt help with my dry skin. i do not recommend.

743,stephjud,1,11-May-18,One person found this helpful,I love this lotion! It really lasts  and I find I use the product more efficiently because it is not a pump container.
744,Joan Graham,1,05-Apr-19, ,Second time ordering this brand as my physician recommended it. I love how smooth it goes on the face and body and does not leave your skin feeling greasy.
745,muttlover,1,01-Jul-18, ,I ve been using CeraVe moisturizing cream for a few years. I does a wonderful job of moisturizing. Someone I met a few years said that since CeraVe lotion has hylauranic acid in it  it is as good as more expensive products.

748,murpharitaville,1,07-Feb-18,One person found this helpful,This has been my favorite year-round body moisturizer for several years. Even in the hot summer months it doesn t feel greasy or tacky. It was also recommended by my dermatologist.

752,TheMimbo,1,06-Mar-19, ,Great stuff. We use it on both our bodies and faces. Having the tub is also super convenient and less cream gets wasted unlike lotions with a spout.
753,markos gerges,0,10-Mar-18, ,Honestly as a guy with dry skin this doesn t do me much good. It s horrible if you have facial hair as this is a lotion and since it s so thick you have to be careful how much you apply otherwise you ll just have a. Ears full of lotion. I didn t think it helped me with my dry skin as I would still have dry skin. Maybe this product is better for women
754,@,1,16-Jun-19, ,Our son has dry spots on his skin and this was a virtual miracle. Applying it twice a day helped heal the skin back to normal.

763,Jane Smith,1,20-Feb-16, ,Got a three pack for less than a single on one of Amazons price drops on a whim  since it was so cheap. I use it every morning and night  and after half a year  I am still using the first tub. My skin is so soft  and smooth. I am acne prone as well  yet I have never broken out using this cream even when I layer a lot of foundation on top. Since it smooths my face  it acts as a great primer. I used to use Ceraphil moisturizing scream of St Ives lotion  but this is the best by far.
764,Lizz Best,1,03-Oct-17, ,My all time favorite skin care brand. Anyone by crave is worth every dollar. Simple ingridents that get the job done !!! I have this on monthly subcription. I love th slather it on after a shower. Keeps my legs and arms moisturized. It can be too thick for the face.
765,crystall7,1,13-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,I like this. My doctor had me use this in conjunction with another product. It works as expected for my sensitive skin.
766,T. Mao,1,22-May-19, ,This moisturizer is probably one of the best moisturizers I have ever used. It keeps my skin from being dry for a long time  and the moisturizer feels like it has a really high quality. This is definitely worth my money.
767,TobycW,1,13-Mar-19, ,Use at night  or during the day  with sunscreen applied afterwards. Although the tub is huge  don t overapply. This should last you a while.

769,Janis L. Lang,1,29-Sep-18, ,I have tried every lotion on the market. CeraVe outshines them all. It is 3 hours since I slathered this on my hands. I have washed my hands twice and the cuticles are still moist.
770,Arirangfan,1,08-Mar-19, ,Great product! My skin seems to love it. Use it for my face and hands in the morning and at night after cleansing and using toner.
771,Amazon Customer,1,19-Feb-19, ,I went through a weird period of having orange-ish  dry  circular patches of skin on both cheeks and nothing would help them. I had never had anything like this before  and was panicking. CeraVe cleared them up amazingly fast and it s now the only moisturizer I trust for my face. No dry skin or discoloration since I started using this. Truly cannot speak highly enough of it!
772,Brian Tsai,1,11-Jun-18, ,Very thick and doing great job keeping my skin moist. I have dry skin and most of the cream I used to use were too thin and not long lasting . This cream is more expensive but really worth the price
773,Ana,1,25-Jan-17, ,What a great lotion! No smell  no greasy residue. Really moisturizers you all day. I love this product and buy two at a time.

784,J. Williams,1,05-Jul-16,3 people found this helpful,This cream is absolutely a lifesaver. I have eczema (especially on my legs  arms and hands) and have struggled with it since I was a teenager. Living in a relatively humid area and moisturizing regularly kept it in check for many years... until I got pregnant. Suddenly  my eczema was WORSE than it was when I first found out that I had it. Two  then 10  then 22 itchy  red patches... with more showing up all the time! Throughout all of this as it quickly grew worse I was desperately trying everyone s suggestions- my mother s suggestion of coconut oil didn t touch it  and some  natural  lotions did not seem to do a thing for it either. I quit shaving my legs but the patches that were already there refused to fade. My OB was somewhat casual about the whole thing:  Some women s skin conditions improve with pregnancy  and others just get worse.  He had no recommendations of anything safe to prescribe; the steroid creams that had first cleared up my eczema when I had it  and subsequently helped the few times it had started to get dire  were not recommended for pregnancy. Finally  someone who actually has a friend who went through what I was going through during pregnancy recommended CeraVe to me. At first I was worried about parabens (before I did some research on actual risk factors that allayed my fears quite a bit) so I held off  but no natural remedy was working and the patches continued to get worse; I had zombie legs. Some of the patches had progressed to the open-sore stage  and that s when I decided I had to try this  because a staph infection during pregnancy and whatever was needed to treat it would likely be a whole lot riskier for my baby than the parabens. Within just days of applying this cream I could see visible improvements (and it felt better immediately). I am still not shaving my legs (pants for me! and no before and after photos because I have serious gorilla legs) and I apply this after showering. The patches on my legs are fading away and are nearly gone. I still have to apply the cream lest they become dry and angry again  but they have almost fully healed at this point. It only took a few weeks for them to nearly melt away. Thank goodness. I wish I had used this sooner before it had gotten so out of control  but next time I won t wait so long to apply the only thing besides steroid cream that has ever helped me with a truly severe eczema breakout.

I also like that it isn t scented. After using this for 4 months  I m now annoyed by the formerly  mild  smell of other cheap lotions. Ick.
792,Em Ferris,1,31-Mar-14, ,Packaging kept product very clean. CeraVe is a great moisturizer. Dermatologist at Duke University in North Carolina advised me to get this to hydrate my skin and also to help with the constant itching for Keratosis Pilaris. This has helped places heal all over my body  that would not heal. It is a miracle  I don t itch excessively now. She said the cream is much better because it is more condensed than lotion so it will hydrated more. I find this company to be less expensive than the local stores.

I usually apply it once per day  but in the winters I step it up to two times a day - once in the morning and once in the evening after I shower. It also helps with the flakiness I get on my face from retinoids (specifically Retin-A). Some people are sensitive to the fatty alcohol moisturizers in the formula  so I recommend that people patch test the cream in a small area before putting it over your whole face!  The formulation is a heavy - I think it has to be because it s thaaat moisturizing - but it absorbs quickly and doesn t leave a filmy feeling on my skin.
797,B. Harlow,1,04-Apr-19, ,I have extremely dry skin so my dermatologist suggested I use Cerave. Love this product so much I am now using the face cream too
798,Anna May Cleveland,1,07-Dec-18, ,This product is great!! Softens your skin!!! It really works!!! Soft hands  elbows  feet!!! Any skin on your body will benefit form this!!!
799,Lynn keith,1,12-Nov-18, ,Miracle lotion I swear. I have horrific eczema on my hands that burns and cracks and nothing has helped. Then I used this and it started healing it immediately.
800,Sheila Seevers,1,05-Dec-17, ,This product was recommended by an allergist and after reading reviews I thought I would give it a try. I notice an improvement in my skin in just days! I use it head to toe. Works just as good on my feet as it does on my face. Love it and will continue to purchase.
801,Mary,1,13-Jun-19, ,I have extremely dry  sensitive skin  and this cream is so nourishing on my skin from head to toe. My skin feels soft and moisturized for hours.
802,Yuri Sobol,1,25-Sep-18, ,I got a great deal on this--cheaper than in a store. It s a large jar that will last a long time. It feels great upon application  and it moisturizes very effectively.
803,Series Fan,1,18-Feb-17,One person found this helpful,Fantastic cream! We use it for everything from our faces  to a moisturizing hand lotion and body lotion. This product is reasonably priced  and works well for us in our dry  high altitude environment. Fast delivery!
804,SPR,1,25-Jul-17, ,Takes care of the worst eczema  moisturizes deeply and thoroughly. It s odor free and surprisingly lasts a long time. You will need to apply at least 3 times a day to see best results (that again would depend on how severely damaged the skin is to begin with.)
805,Annie,1,08-Jan-15, ,CeraVe Cream is the bomb. If you haven t used it before you should know that it is mondo thick and wicked good. I personally do not find a hint of greasiness in it. It s smooth as silk and makes a huge difference  particularly in Winter or after the beach. This is a LARGE tub and it will last you quite a long time. Use it over your entire body after getting out of the shower. Pat yourself dry  don t rub. Then apply everywhere you can reach. Heaven!
806,FANNZ,1,01-Feb-17, ,I love CeraVe for my skin during the winter. As long as I apply a light layer of this in the morning and night my dry patches always go away. Since the moisturizing is really concentrated  a little goes a long way so this tub lasts for quite some time. Will always repurchase for the colder seasons!!
807,71Buick,1,07-May-19, ,I have super sensitive skin and this works amazing. It is lightweight and the scent is not off putting.
808,Shari A. Mann,1,16-Jul-18, ,Been using this most excellent product for years. And  Amazon beat Costco s price  at least on this order. Who d-a-thunk it? I ll continue to buy this most excellent product.
809,Brenda Wolfe,1,17-Jun-14, ,Seriously....this cream is so awesome  even my husband loves it and uses it. It has no scent (I personally like a scent  he doesn t)  it s not greasy and our skin feels amazing. I had never used it before but was looking for something to help stall the aging process of my skin. I m 49 and I took this cream to my skin care professional to ask her opinion of it. She said she LOVED it too  that it had all the right and important ingredients in it. I loved it so much  I went out and bought the entire line  hand cream  face wash  eye cream  am and pm lotion and bought my 20 year old a set too. I told her to start taking care of her skin now. She ll be happy when she s 49 and has beautiful skin. I highly recommend this cream and as a side note  I am loving the other products from CeraVe as well.
810,barb0710,1,01-Sep-16, ,My dermatologist recommended Amlactin and even though it says  fragrance free  it still has an odor until it soaks into the skin which is bothersome to me. CeraVe was recommended and has the same ingredients... I tried it and absolutely LOVE this cream. I have psoriasis and it helps make my skin so soft???? Would recommend this to others.
811,C. C. McMahon,1,03-Sep-18, ,This is better than anything else I have tried to moisturize my dry skin. It was originally recommended by my dermatologist and is the only  lotion  type product I use.
812,Autumn Dawid,1,17-Nov-16,One person found this helpful,Best stuff when I was on accutane. I would lather this on thick every single night  and it helped more than anything else I used (including some intense Clinique stuff). I ve used it on my body as well  but it really doesn t work as well as a body lotion. Best for face and hands.
813,Suzie,0,24-Feb-19, ,This cream promises a protective skin barrier and within just a few days of use this cream did indeed create a barrier that did nothing but coat my face and skin with grease and clog the pores  resulting in numerous white-heads. No thank you  I’ll stick with Clinque.
814,Perla,1,18-Apr-19, ,My doctor ??????? Recommended This face lotion ?? for my face I feel great it’s not sticky or greasy it perfect ??
815,S,1,05-Jun-19, ,I normally use expensive Dermalogica moisturizers but got tired of the price tag and it was no longer working very well on my sensitized skin (from allergies). I’ve been using this cream for about a week now  and I loveeeeee it! Greatly priced for a giant tub! Non scented & leaves my skin feeling great
816,Richie L.,1,27-Jun-18, ,good cream  but quite  runny . on a scale of 1 to 10 for goopiness  with lotion from a pump bottle being 1  this CeraVe would be about a 5  and Cetaphil would be a 10.
817,Robert Reger,1,24-Feb-19, ,Recommended by my dermatologist now that I live in the desert... so good my mom stole it. Guess I ll have to order more...
818,Katie Danzer,1,03-May-19, ,Definitely a great moisturizer but because there’s no scent  it smells a bit sour. It works great though!
819,kellie,1,16-Feb-18, ,This is one of my favorite basic moisturizer. Came as described and smells the same as the 12 oz tub I had previously from walmart if that helps anyone lol! It s a good thick moisturizer I like it for face and body.
820,Katiepowpow,1,23-Feb-19, ,A bit thick for my liking but other than that it feels so good on my very dry skin. Not greasy or oily just refreshing.
821,C. Wallace,1,15-Oct-18, ,Nice  thick  creamy moisturizer. It s working great for my normal to dry skin (46 yrs). You get a lot for the money and this should last me at least a year.
822,DevD,1,30-Nov-16, ,My daughter has eczema and we tried almost everything on earth without significant relief. CeraVe provided relief almost immediately to the point where I wondered if it contained any steroid. But I can see improvements in her skin and the kind of softness and healthy feel that steroids don t provide. I don t know if this will cure her eczema but the kind of symptomatic relief she got was amazing.
823,AE,1,08-Feb-18, ,I feel like I m putting a body lotion on my face when I use this. It feels a little sticky. Since I only use it at night and I haven t broken out from it  it s working fine as a moisturizer. I trust the brand and like the fact that it s unscented.
824,Nancy Turek,1,01-Jan-19, ,Have always had trouble with dry itchy skin in tne winter. Have also started with some eczema. No problems since using this product.
825,Amazon Customer,1,16-Mar-19, ,I was pleasantly surprised at the creaminess of this moisturizer! I usually buy Cetaphil but this has got me hooked. Its so refreshing finding cheaper products that are better than the name brands.
826,Sophie Shrader,1,08-Oct-18, ,This cream really works especially if you you use it right after your shower. Use it all over your body for best results. It is absorbed into the skin quickly with no oily residue.
827,Kindle Customer,1,11-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,Really absorbs well  not greasy! Love how it moisturizes my really dry skin
828,Theresa Keith,1,15-May-19, ,This is great stuff! It is not too thick  rubs on easily and does not have any real fregrance. I use it all over my face  arms and legs and it feels silky on my skin hours later. When I use it on my face it does not sting my eyes.
829,Barbara,1,16-Sep-18, ,BEST cream ever for older women. The time-release moisturizing capabilities keeps my farmer s skin soft all day and the wrinkles even go away after application.
830,Alex Yang,1,13-Dec-15,One person found this helpful,Winter on the east coast can be difficult  especially for someone like me who has persistently dry skin. The Cerave moisturizing cream has been great! I use it right away when I get out of the shower while my skin is still damp and I stay moisturized all day. The cream does not have an oily feel to it like many moisturizers and within a few minutes you don t even notice it at all.
831,Marjorie Carlotto Yokoda Stobbe,1,13-May-19, ,Feels great on the skin and you don’t need much  could smell better but it’s good that there’s no unnecessary extra scents  good for my husbands dry skin and also for mine  which is balanced.
832,Amazon Customer,0,20-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,I m very disappointed that it didn t come sealed. It didn t at least have a seal inside so I m very skeptical to use it. I m scared to get a bad reaction because it s open  who knows if it was previously use or something like that.
833,Kts,1,11-Dec-17, ,My dermatologist recommended this for my aging dry skin. I love it because there s no fragrance  it dries up nicely and leaves my skin feeing  normal  all day. I bought the same product in the pump bottle also.
834,Amazon Customer,1,28-May-18,One person found this helpful,Love this cream. Makes your skin feel silky without feeling greasy.
835,Honey,1,20-Aug-18, ,I ve been enjoying this product! I use it 2x a day and it dries  dry  and smooth. Perfect for putting under makeup. I ll slather it everywhere else as well.
836,lorrie resop,1,04-Jan-19, ,I love this product my doctor recommends it because it’s natural and there’s no additives and artificial stuff in it it’s all natural or use it for my whole body
837,Harvestman,1,03-Nov-17, ,I ve used several different brands of creams for dry skin that well-meaning friends recommended over many years. I ve been disappointed with each of them until CeraVe. This is the only product that significantly helps the eczema that affects my hands from October until the end of winter every year.
838,Robin E. Davidson,1,28-Jan-18, ,I love this lotion. After my bath at night I put this all over my body. I put on my p.j.s and sleep so good and my skin is soft as silk. It s not too greasy and the scent is very little !!! I highly recommend it !!
839,Reading On,1,23-Dec-18, ,This cream is thick and when used on back and arms  etc. it remains moist and cuts down on dryness for the day. Very good product.
840,djwilson99,1,03-Jun-19, ,I love this lotion it s thick enough to give you moisture for the whole day yet its not greasy
841,crissy thomas,1,16-Jan-19, ,Best lotion I have ever used I lay in tanning bed and have a pool restored my dried out skin love it non greasy no smell
842,CGST720,1,20-Apr-19, ,What s not to like??? Love this for everyday use!!! Moisturizes without being sticky!!!
843,CourtneyC,1,28-Feb-19, ,This was recommended to us by our pediatrician for our daughters  eczema. This is by far the MOST moisturizing product  thick but absorbs quickly and I can tell it soothes their delicate skin. As a 30 year old woman of 2 under 3  I use this as a sleep moisturizer as well and love it for replenishing our skin in our entire household.
844,Mel,1,19-Sep-17, ,Pros: ☆ Very good at moisturizing ☆ Good value  good amount given  Cons ☆ A bit heavy on the skin ☆ Not pleasant smelling  I ve read about people using this in their face. I have normal to moderately dry skin on my face so its a bit too heavy for me. However it s great on the rest if my body  like arms and legs. The smell is a bit chemically rather than a neutral smell.
845,M. Spisak,1,15-Mar-19, ,I bought this for my face. It s great on my body  but on my face it leaves a dry film and makeup won t blend.
846,Aaron,1,30-Jan-17, ,CeraVe always gets the job done. I ve used CeraVe moisturizer for years now and it always works great. I found this container far too large for my use and the moisturizer in smaller containers. But if you need a large amount of fantastic moisterizer  this is the product for you.
847,angelfly39,1,07-Sep-18, ,I bought this for my severely dried skinned son. We have tried many creams but this one made him smooth within a week. Hope the smoothness will last long!
848,Hal,1,02-Jul-19, ,I am using this on my face every night prior to going to bed. It has made a difference with my dry skin.
849,Denise mccray,1,25-Oct-18, ,Love this stuff. I was skeptical but I bought the face wash and lotion. The lotion makes my face feel so soft and hasn t given me one pimple which other lotions have.
850,PrincessLeah60,1,29-Apr-19, ,Have adult breakouts. Read a lot of reviews about this product not causing breakouts and I haven’t had a breakout since ibstarted using it. I’m 35 yrs old with 2 kids under 2. I really like this cream. First time trying it and i like the size. Won’t have to purchase so often. Just wish it came in a pump version.
851,Pamela Montoya,1,01-Jun-19, ,I use this product on my body  face  hands and feet. I have dry sensitive skin. I have tried a wide variety of dermatologist recommended moisturizers and found this is the one for me. It comes in a tub and has a very thick  yet smooth consistency. A little goes a very long way and the moisturizing lasts over 24 hours.
852,Cody B. Tucker,0,24-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,It s very thick. I got it primarly for use on my face  and this is not recommended. It s hard to rub in  and seemed to actually accentuate the fine lines on my face. It irritated my face as well.
853,Mjfitzge,1,31-Jan-15, ,The best facial moisturizer on the planet  period. I ve been buying Cerave for over a year now and it has done wonders for my skin. It isn t greasy and soaks right in. My one complaint would be that it doesn t come with a pump so you do have to put you hand in the tub every time  as long as your hands are clean this shouldn t be a problem!  I have sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts (and a lot of moisturizers give me breakouts) this one doesn t and my skin seems to love it!
854,Lindsey Blake,1,16-Apr-19, ,Ordered this moisturizer for my husband who has very dry skin. He’s picky about everything and loves this product! No scent  very hydrating  long lasting  and has never irritated either one of our skin. I’ve recommended this product to so many friends and family. Definitely will keep purchasing.
855,Mike KinCannon,0,06-Apr-19, ,Worst moisturizer out there. Doesnt do anything the post describes. Instead of actually leaving skin soft and clear. Made my skin red  irritated and started to break out. I never get acne or pimples and this product made me do so  would not recommend. After a couple uses I threw it away
856,Chris Chu,1,17-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,comes on clean. not a lot of greasiness
857,Jiyon Hong,1,17-Jan-19, ,The best moisturizing cream ever. I bought this for my son who has very sensitive skin  gets dry and itch all the time. He was literally waking up every night scratching. He rarely wake up scratching ever since he has been using this. It is thick and moisturizing but not sticky at all. It just penetrates right into skin leaving the skin soft and hydrated. Now it became my favorite moisturizer for me too.
858,Lisa,1,02-Apr-19, ,Amazing! My face has been incredibly dey for several months now. I finally looked for a solution and chose this. Been using for 3 days and my face feels and looks amazing! No more dry skin! I can put this on my face as often as I want and it doesnt get greasy.
859,Mrs. Randolph,1,06-Feb-19, ,As someone with eczema and dry skin  this is my absolute fave body moisturizer. It is effective and long-lasting.
860,Albert,1,12-Jul-17, ,One of the best moisturizers I ve used. To be honest I thought it wouldn t be so different from previous tub moisturizers ive used before. The same old oily moisturizer. So I did my regular routine and applied the moisturizer and amazingly it was absorbed into my skin without a oily layer on my top layer of skin. The moisturizer made my skin very soft which I was happy about. At least now I can go to bed with this moisturizer on without worrying about it sticking to my pillow. I would so buy this product again.
861,AznJoker,1,24-Apr-19, ,It s a great moisturizer  dries quickly  and the greasy feeling goes away quickly. I hate the greasy feeling  so I never really had a habit of moisturizing  but now that I live in Michigan  the winters wreck my skin.  This works great in the winter and tolerable in the humid summers.
862,Cristy Scholler,1,16-Aug-18, ,I love this lotion! It always leaves my skin hydrated but not feeling greasy. Purchased this online because I was too lazy to g to the store and it was cheaper online.
863,Yemi,1,27-Jun-19, ,This is a phenomenal product. While it might be a little face-heavy for some  it s perfect for the body. Typically  I moisturize right out of the shower while skin is damp  and this has worked really well that way. I ve gone through several jars without any issues regarding the quality or otherwise. As a result  I see no reason not to keep patronizing this.
864,Paula T.,1,19-May-19, ,my nieces dr advised her of this product....great value...great product...great price
865,Jazmin Hernandez,1,15-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,This is perfect for people who break out easily with lotions! As someone with easily irrated and dry skin  I was hesitant at first with this product  but boy was I wrong! My skin is finally soft and smooth! Another thing I loved about this product is that it doesn’t leave your skin oily like other creams!

868,SLG,1,18-Jan-19, ,This cream is light and smooth. It is absorbed quickly with no greasy feel. I use this on my face  body  and feet.
869,Kinks,1,10-Apr-19, ,This dream is amazing  great for any parts of body  also use on face with Retinol A stops excessive dryness. Great price and size.
870,Jemma2,1,16-Feb-19, ,The only moisturizer my dermatologist recommends. It settles into the skin with no greasy after-feel and lasts 24 hours. The cream works better than the lotion.
871,Jacqueline Aguilar,1,25-Apr-19, ,Great product and great value! My husband has troubled skin and this has helped him a lot!
872,Cristi Belloli,1,08-Jun-17,One person found this helpful,This lotion is the best for people who have skin sensitivities due to underactive thyroid him. Plus it has hyaluronic acid in it which helps with aging. I have a recommend this lotion
873,Brandon Elbers,1,19-Jun-18, ,The tub will last a long time. Has helped with my facial redness and dry skin. I use it after I shave and it prevents any razor burn or irritation.
874,Megan,1,06-Jan-18, ,Super simple moisturizing cream. I love how hydrating it is. My dermatologist recommended this (okay for acne!) over my very expensive products I had been purchasing. nice to have a solid budget option. :)
875,World Traveler,1,22-May-16,3 people found this helpful,the best cream ever for dry skin. My dermatologist recommended it and I love it. Easy to apply and not at all creasy or sticky.
876,Kim Jong Ellen,1,05-Jan-18, ,I love this stuff because after a shower I can use it from head to toe without worrying about any breakouts on my face. May not be true for everyone but at least for legs and arms this is universally great lotion.
877,Sincity,1,06-Jun-19, ,Having used both vanicream and this one  I feel vanicream is much better.
878,chloe4paws,1,03-Feb-18, ,Good cream but a bit thin. I expected it to have a thicker viscosity. It seems to work well so far and absorbs quickly without greasy feel. It tends to burn my face when applying.
879,Bill DeMar,0,16-Apr-19, ,I didn’t like the feel. Absorbed into skin quickly but didn’t feel moisturized
880,A&R,1,30-May-13, ,I have heard many  many great things about this moisturizer  so I thought I d give it a try. In fact I bought it for my baby (10 months) to help with her skin. She gets these little bumps and I thought a good moisturizer could help with it. And I also use it as my facial moisturizer. I love that it dries quickly and doesn t feel sticky or oily. I ve only been using it for a few weeks  but I like it. And I ll probably get it when we run out. By the way  a little goes a long way.
881,Been There,1,27-Aug-18, ,Sinks in quickly  leaves skin feeling soft but not sticky  easy to use. 19 oz. lasts a long time  too. I use after every shower and love it.
882,DBrown,1,14-May-17, ,Amazing skin cream of all over. I use this on my baby s super sensitive skin. Johnson & Johnson sensitive lotion was breaking his skin out and since I switched  his skin is clear. I use it too and it s amazing. Can t beat Amazon s price of this lotion
883,Heather Jones,1,08-Jun-19, ,Dermatologist recommended this for our daughter  who has severe eczema. It s done wonders! We use it by itself and mix it with her prescription hydrocortisone to help it stay on better.
884,rw0540,1,31-Jul-14,2 people found this helpful,Is the only all over lotion/cream I use. I have very sensitive skin and eczema. I can t express my appreciation for this product enough. Doesn t sting and I can use it on all my body. Love it! It seems expensive but it is well worth the money for what it does. This price with Prime is much more affordable than buying at the store.
885,Dorothy A. Langford,1,22-May-19, ,Great moisturizing compound! Used on rough elbows  dry legs and feet.
886,Mizzou5300,1,19-Jan-19, ,Thick and rich but absorbs well so you never feel greasy. I use it as a face and body cream. Recommended by dermatologist and I like it
887,Catpaws,1,16-Jun-18, ,Great value! After buying pricey night creams for years and years I got smart! This has a great texture and leaves my skin very smooth & soft.
888,D and J,1,18-Nov-17, ,My dermatologist suggested this. It s been working great. I just ordered the pump version too  I do think the pump would be helpful. the product is fantastic though  especially for the price.
889,Amazon Customer,1,25-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,I have extremely dry skin  this has officially saved my skin! This has been the best product I’ve tried  trust me I’ve tried MANY! It’s so moisturizing and also I have sensitive skin and it didn’t make me break out in rashes.
890,cnana,1,27-Feb-19, ,Very protective. Because it is so thick it absorbs slowly. I like to alternate this product with an almond butter which is thinner & absorbs faster.
891,E. C.,1,16-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,This is the only cream I use on my face and body. It goes on easily and leaves the skin feeling incredibly moisturized without being greasy or overwhelming. There is no scent and the container is large enough to keep me through months of cold winter air as well as dry summer air.
892,mtv,1,23-Jun-13,2 people found this helpful,I have skin problems since I was a child (not eczema). Having lived in humid Southeast Asia all of my non-adult life  itching was non-existent and dismissed scaling on my scalp as dandruff. When I decided to live in the West Coast 4 years ago  my skin problem became more pronounced. Scalp itch went from being an infrequent annoyance to a source of infection. I saw a dermatologist and he recommended Cerave to me.  After I emptied my last 16 oz  I opted for a cheaper alternative (Curel). Well  let me just say I had to go back to my dermatologist because of a sudden skin reaction to using Curel and got prescribed a Triamcinolone Acetonide cream for the itch.  Although I have accepted mild itching as fact of life for my skin condition (especially depending on the season)  I have never used another skin cream or lotion besides Cerave ever since.
893,Mary Mary Mary,1,22-Jan-15,3 people found this helpful,Best all around moisturizing cream I have ever found. Without ever being greasy it feels like I have a silky barrier on my legs. No more does my skin dry out after I swim five days a week. First found it in the pharmacy at Kaiser at a higher price. I m sold!!!
894,Sarah Jacks,1,08-Mar-18, ,I’ve never been able to use moisturizer because my skin is crazy sensitive and oily. Until i found this. I’ve been using this for years now  and it’s absolutely wonderful. I’ll never switch!

901,Carol Ann Collins,1,20-Apr-19, ,This cream keeps my skin soft and lightly moist. It is my solution to annoying itch!
902,Lora Cicciarelli,1,24-Feb-17, ,This is a great price for this moisturizer. My dermatologist recommended this for my extremely dry skin and has given me samples of the Cerave ointment. I have had just as good luck with this cream working. I will definitely be buying this again!!
903,KK,1,17-Dec-13,2 people found this helpful,I ve had combination skin that has been causing me problems for years. Dry and flaky in some spots  oily and prone to cystic acne in others. This stuff is MAGIC. My skin is amazingly moisturized  and it has not caused ANY breakouts  which is really saying something  because usually just thinking about trying a new product is enough for me to have one! I highly recommend this moisturizer.
904,Rebecca,1,31-Oct-14,3 people found this helpful,At first I did not like this lotion. It made my skin feel gooey. I ve been using it now for a few weeks and like it a lot. I also bought AM PM lotion by Cerave from Walgreens (cheaper than Amazon)  and after about two weeks started noticing visible improvements with my skin. Tone improved  texture improved  I have spots near my right eye and lip from smoking which are getting lighter (I quit smoking 2 yrs ago  worst thing I ever did for my skin!) I have a pretty extensive skincare routine. I only use dial anti-bacterial soap for face wash  sometimes I mix micro derm crystals with it. I use a Salux washcloth to exfoliate (if you don t have one  buy one! Those are amazing!!!)  I use vitamin C booster for age spots and wrinkles  coconut oil  alpha lipoic acid  and now Cerave. Cerave AM PM contains niacin (vitamin B3) and this contains Hyaluronic Acid  which is why I purchased it. Those two ingredients are used in high end department store products  why? Because they work! I take nicacin in a vitamin form  when you take the vitamin internally  you will have a flushing sensation. I m used to that. With the AM PM lotion you may notice that on your face the first few weeks  but it s not a big deal and it goes away. Using this lotion  my legs are no longer dry and itchy. I epilate instead of shave and if I use this after epilating  my skin feel like I ve used a razor to shave  something that has never happened with epilating. This is the cheapest alternative I ve found with those ingredients. I will be using this for the rest of my life. Cerave is not expensive compared to what you d spend on Lancome or other high end products  and these really work. I ve tried  Loreal products  Oil of Olay (which I like but there are much better products than that)  and other various brands. I think I ve got my skincare down now. I have products that really work that are not expensive  and Cerave is definitely one of them. You owe it to your skin to try Cerave products. Only suggestion...look at CVS or Walgreens first. You may find it cheaper like I did.
905,sav jackson,0,21-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,I like the CeraVe cleanser so I decided to try this but this product does the exact opposite. It makes my skin extremely dry and sticky right away. No matter how little I put on is sucks all the moisture from my skin!
906,Amazon Customer,1,02-May-19, ,Large tub lasts forever  and gives consistent moisturization you can count on. No need for 10 different moisturizing products with this  good for a minimalist.
907,Karen F. Calandra,1,08-Dec-18, ,This is the absolute best body  face cream ever invented! We are in our 70’s & cetaceans is a lifesaver??.
908,BJ Bolender,1,20-Nov-16, ,Best cream ever for dry skin  recommended by my dermatologist. It is medium weight  not a light coat. This is good because when you use it  it will dry and you still feel that it is working. All my friends now use this cream as well. Far better than a lotion and long-lasting.
909,DC10745,1,08-Sep-16, ,We use this on our whole family from our newborn to adult. Both of our kiddos suffer with eczema and this cream after baths does wonders! We then use the cerave regular lotion throughout the day. Love the moisture quality  no scent  absorbs nicely and not greasy. Definitely worth the purchase.
910,Delarae Basques,1,28-Sep-14,2 people found this helpful,My son and I uses Cerave. We love how it feels on our skin. I don t care for sticky or oily moiturizing creams and Cerave is none of those. We use it twice a day. I ve been buying Cerave from a pharmacy  which is so expensive. Now that I have found it online for a great price  I will never buy it from a pharmacy again.

917,Miriam C.,1,06-Sep-17, ,Works very well for eczema. Moisturizes all day after only one use  and a little bit goes a long way. It is thick  but that doesn t bother me. It is a great product. Their facial products are great too!

919,LT,1,15-Jun-16, ,I have very dry hands (a special type of eczema only to the hands) after having my 2nd child. This cream is the only one that I feel really helps to moisturize my hands (if I can just remember to apply it on frequently!). I like to use this on my children as well  who also has eczema. Much better value on Amazon.com than at your brick-and-mortar stores.
920,amarege,1,17-Apr-19, ,Very moisturizing and absorbing. Does not have heavy scent.

927,Amazon Customer,1,18-Sep-16, ,My toddler has very dry and itchy skin. Doctor recommended this. This is the only cream that my daughter doesnt say no to. And her dry skin is much better and itching is almost gone. I have tried Cetaphil (which I personally love)  but this works much better on my daughters dry skin.
928,Amazon Customer,1,12-Jul-18, ,I ve used this product for years and it s great for dry  sensitive skin. If you have oily skin  this may make your skin appear more shiny. Great for winter.
929,robin,1,07-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,Creamy and moisturizing. Makes my skin hydrated and soft. I use it on my face and all over body.

931,Anita C. Shore,0,16-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,This product did not work at all. I bought it based on reviews believing that it would help my eczema. But instead it made it WORSE. Now stuck trying to find other products to counteract the effects of this product.
932,Ciara Alyssa,1,26-Feb-19, ,I am diabetic and this moisturizer is awesome for my very dry skin. Highly recommend!!
933,CJM,1,01-Jun-19, ,One of the best things I’ve ever used for my dry skin. Love it.
934,Pippie P,1,01-Apr-12,One person found this helpful,My two young boys both have eczema. I d tried many different lotions and ointments  but Cerave is the only one that works for them. If they have a flare-up -- a patch of bumpy  red skin  I put Cerave on it twice a day for a couple of days and it ends up healed. I love it for my very dry hands. My husband is very picky about lotion and refused to use it for years  but likes Cerave. He uses it on rash-y skin  but I ve even caught him using it on his hands just because they felt dry.
935,Amazon Customer,1,23-Nov-17, ,I was surprised at the amount you get. Def worth the price. Smooth to apply  works very well!!! Will def reorder when I run out. Out of all the products I ve tried  this is def the best.

938,Folkiepants,1,04-Mar-19, ,This has worked great for my daughters cracked skin on her hands from the winter weather. She has sensitive skin and this helped her more than any other product we have used.
939,Buckeye Guy,1,06-Jan-19, ,I already had some if this and ordered this one as a gift for someone. We both like it. It works great.
940,Nathan Hale,1,28-Jun-19, ,My young daughter s dermatologist recommended we use this twice daily on my daughter to keep her eczema under control. Works well  doesn t have a scent and is far better than anything else on the market currently. Amazon is MUCH cheaper than buying this at local stores - so be sure to buy here!
941,Maria B,1,19-Nov-17, ,My forehead was so dry  I m not certain if it was psoriasis or sun damage. Online I found reviews by people with psoriasis who found CeraVe as a miracle moisturizer. I ordered it and as soon as I got it  I used it on my face . Within 3 days the dry patches were disappearing.
942,Rural Internet Shopper,1,16-Apr-19, ,Works well for very dry skin and helps with eczema. Love that this comes in a tub and you don’t have to deal with a pump. No strong odors and no greasy feeling. Very clean-feeling product.
943,Melissa Mertz,1,04-Feb-18, ,This is my first CeraVe product  and I will be trying more. It is very thick and provides instant and lasting moisture. Worth the price! A little goes a long way.
944,DebK,1,21-Oct-15, ,I love this product. Have been using it consistantly for 2-3 years. My skin is noticeably softer. I love that it makes my skin  waterproof  that is  when I shower the next day the water runs off my skin. It is not greasy or oily. It quickly rubs into the skin. Not so good for a massage cream because it does get absorbed fast.
945,MOTHER OF DRAGONS,1,08-Jun-18, ,Loveeeeee love love how my skin feels after I put this moisturizer on. It s light and silky. I m not afraid to use it on my kids and it lasts awhile

947,daniel leroy wille,1,20-Aug-17, ,I have extremely dry skin and have since I was a wee lad. This is by far one of the best moisturizing lotions I have used yet. It leaves my skin soft and silky like the delicate flower that I am.
948,Joe Braucher,1,02-Mar-19, ,I have dry very dry skin (icthyosis) and this lotion helps tremendously  especially in the winter.
949,Alice,1,03-Jan-19, ,Was recommended by my dermotologist over lotion. Love how the moisturizer feels on my skin.
950,Narayana N,1,19-Nov-17, ,The best moisturizing cream I ve ever used in my life  you have to trust the reviews for this item  so soothing just after applying and relieves eczema so well. I regretted that I was looking elsewhere  look no where because this is the best.
951,Stephen M Calhoun,1,01-Jun-19, ,It’s thick and has a great ingredient list. I got it for my husband and although it doesn’t have all the fake fragrances he likes  it is very moisturizing. It really holds moister all night into the morning.
952,Debbie C.,1,28-Feb-19, ,I love this cream. Very moisturizing and soaks in well. No scent.
953,Amazon Customer,1,02-Dec-18, ,My dermatologist recommended this to me. I love it! It s the best for all seasons. It takes a good care of your skin.
954,Review 175,1,04-Sep-18, ,Seems to be keeping my sons chronic eczema at bay. Doesn’t fully heal  but definitely helps. We apply twice a day.
955,olivia,1,01-Jun-17, ,I ve had eczema for my whole life and this is my go-to body cream. It s definitely thicker than a normal lotion but I put it on after the shower and it soaks in pretty fast. This is what multiple dermatologists have recommended for me. I m allergic to a lot of fragrances so this unscented version works perfectly for me.
956,cubs fan,1,10-Jan-19, ,Have small dry skin patches on my nose where my glasses are  helps clean them up
957,Ryu Kyu,1,24-Feb-18, ,Amazing! Period! I want to elaborate more... Not only it is reasonably priced for how much in the jar  my skin feels supple even next morning.
958,Amazon Customer,1,28-May-18,One person found this helpful,Amazing stuff! If you have combo/sensitive skin this is perfect. It not only helps with acne but dry skin also. I use Apple cider vinegar for my acne then put this stuff on  never seen my skin more clear.
959,Briyonah McClain,1,08-Jan-18, ,I absolutely love this moisturize. It’s thick like eucerin but has better benefits as far as acne-prone skin is concerned. I am a person who wash my hands a lot and this always sets me back on track and dissolves quite easily. I also recommend this over the cerave lotion which is a lot thinner. You’ll find yourself applying the lotion much more often than you would the cream.
960,J Jauregui,1,22-Dec-16, ,CeraVe is the best face cream for the price. Under $15 and it lasts for many months. This cream REALLY moisturizes and holds in the moisture all day. I honestly could tell the difference in a week. And my daughter s face was absolutely glowing.
961,Mary,1,02-Dec-18, ,Better than any moisturizer you can buy  forget about Oil of Olay for $24.00 This is just as good
962,SheS,1,26-Nov-18, ,My parents are here visiting we live in the desert so it s very dry they absolutely love this moisturizer.
963,Rachel,0,02-Apr-19, ,This product shouldn t be used on anymore face in my opinion. It clogs pores so easily. Had to switch after I figured out what product was causing this.

965,Hank,1,16-Aug-18,One person found this helpful,Great for people with psoriasis! Hard to find something that works but this does the job.
966,Amazon Customer,1,08-Jun-19, ,This is so moisturizing. I love this product but I love the results even more when your skin is damped from the shower like a little wet and rub it on your skin amazing .
967,Ella,1,18-Jun-19, ,Great moisture  and absorb fast. Great for legs!
968,Nerdcamel books,1,06-Jun-19, ,Great moisturizerfor sensitive skin. Love this product.
969,yolanda,1,23-Mar-19, ,This product was neither here nor there. What I did like about it was that it was not greasy and my face was able to absorb it without breaking out.
970,K. De Mers,1,04-Oct-17, ,We are a eczema ridden family and have loved the cerve lotion. We tried this and I like it even better. It s thicker and even helps my dry (non eczema) hands! I ll be stocking this from now on.
971,Nana,1,27-Feb-19, ,I am pleased with this moisturizing cream. Huge size! Will order again.
972,Deborah,1,03-Jan-19, ,Well I was skeptical because of the low price. It’s a fantastic product !
973,Anna Cohen,1,30-May-19, ,The consistency is thick  but absorbs very quickly and fully  without leaving my face feeling greasy at all. I noticed once I started using this at the end of my skincare routine  the effects of my other products seemed enhanced - my skin s texture became more even  and dark spots faded more quickly.
974,Kris Buffalo,1,01-Nov-18, ,Great! I use it on my face and body. I have sensitive skin and it doesn’t irritate my skin at all.
975,Amazon Customer,1,09-Jun-16, ,After using the Cera-Ve lotion for a while with good results  moisturizing well  a friend recommended the cream. It spreads easily and absorbs well into the skin. Very soon I noticed better texture and suppleness  and a reduced tendency for injuries to the thin skin on my forearms.

977,winter,1,31-Mar-19, ,This really helps with dry winter skin especially on the legs. The price is really good too
978,Amazon Customer,1,25-Jun-19, ,Doesn t make my face flush. Keeps skin hydrated.
979,Celia Rose,1,23-Jun-15, ,This is the only cream that has kept my hands reasonably smooth & hydrated during months of winter cold & forced-air heating [both of which are notorious skin dryers]. My dermatologist recommended that I buy the cream rather than the lotion since it s more concentrated. As it s non-comedogenic  I ve also used it occasionally on my face  with good results.
980,C,1,22-Jun-19, ,I love this so much! Bought it because of the reviews & I’m very glad I did! No residue or oily feeling - it’s instantly absorbed & my skin feels great even a couple days later.

982,luciditycheck,1,08-Jul-14,5 people found this helpful,I have chronically dry and flaking skin on my hand due to years of dishydrotic eczema. Even most of the  for extra dry and damaged and flaking skin  lotions are totally useless. I was turned onto this stuff from reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction. This stuff is the only thing that keeps my disastrous skin (on my hand) moisturized during the day  thanks to ceramides and hyaluronic acid. Protip: When using this  get your hands just barely wet and then apply the lotion on top. Hyaluronic acid works best this way since it can hold up to 1000x its weight in water. If you are also a fellow DE sufferer  give this stuff a try! (Make sure to accompany it by drinking plenty of water each day--at least 2L!)  Seriously  I ve tried tons of other lotions and this is the best. Triple Cream is my second favorite  but CeraVe absorbs way faster and doesn t leave a greasy sheen so it s better for use during the day. Get this with the pump top and you won t regret it.
983,Shannon,1,02-Jan-17, ,I can t use Aloe on my face since it causes a rash and it is hard to find good lotion without aloe. This brand was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I use this all over my body  including my face and I m in love. No oily residue after a few seconds of applying. Does not leave my skin feeling overly moisturized either. This tub lasts forever! I can go a good 2-3 months on one tub of Cerave. I will never buy another brand of lotion again.
984,Peter L.,1,24-Nov-17, ,I love this skin cream. Compared to ther skin cream I had in the past that were pretty pricy this one works just as well. I do not break up from it at all and it helps lock in moisturizer for me at the same time. Love it!

988,GForce,1,29-Jul-18, ,If it’s good enough for babies skin  it’s good enough for me! Not sticky or pasty. Lasts longer than most moisturizer.
989,HL,1,28-Jul-15, ,I bought the product mainly for the purpose of helping with my daughter s eczema. It failed on that part  but I still give it 4 start because I liked how the cream was thick  and it a decent job at moisturizing. And since 4 stars is  I like it  and 3 stars mean it s  okay . I chose I like it for the moisturizing part and 3 stars for the eczema helping part.
990,From Monterey  CA,1,29-Apr-19, ,No scent  very creamy and easily absorbed

Our dermatologist recommended this moisturizing cream (in conjunction with Solbar Zinc sunscreen) for daily use to help mitigate that risk. Both products aren t exactly cheap  nor are they overly expensive  but as was told to me   They re both cheaper than chemotherapy!

997,Asia,1,04-Apr-19, ,I ve been using this for a week now and my skin is looking so much better! I have really dry skin on my face and this has gotten rid of most of it. It has been the only moisturizer to get rid of so much of the dry skin. I am very impressed.
998,Joe Schwartz,1,14-May-13,2 people found this helpful,I figured since this was gentle enough to put on my breast tumor  it would be gentle enough on my face. My face turned red. But it worked great everywhere else. I bought an applicator stick so I could spread it on my back and around my ankles easily. Those traditionally itchy spots calmed down within a week. It is a very heavy thick cream that doesn t even wash all the way off in the shower. I love it. It moisturizers and does help protect the skin barrier. I think this will work well after the radiation treatments. Lesson learned: never use a moisturizer or sun block on your face that doesn t have the word  facial  on the label.
999,Christina Spade,1,30-Jan-18, ,I ve tried soooo many lotions to help with my weird drying skin and this one works wonders! I love that it doesn t have much of a scent to it also.

1027,GxR915.Wolf,1,28-Jun-18, ,I use this on my face and body. Makes my skin moisturized all day. It doesn t have a strong scent to it.
1028,H. Bickers,1,05-Apr-16,5 people found this helpful,My mother s dermatologist recommended this stuff - it is hands down the best moisturizer I have ever used. No greasy  doesn t leave your skin feeling  coated  and it really does a job on elderly skin. Wax moles  keratosis  crow s feet  CPAP nostrils  cracked cuticles - anywhere there s skin you can use CeraVe. It s not petroleum-based so lets the skin  breathe   it washes out of linens and clothes without leaving grease spots  and it doesn t leave the patient slippery - an important safety consideration in elder care. But you don e have to be old get benefits from this effective product at a good price.

1031,Kelly,1,23-Jun-19, ,This is my go-to moisturizer. I have extremely sensitive skin and it works perfectly for me. A little goes a long way  and it’s fairly thick and sticky so if you like light weight products this might not be the one for you but I love it.
1032,sandra,0,21-Sep-18, ,It is a watered down version of what I usually purchase at my local CVS store and it does not moisturize as the  real  version either. Very disappointing.
1033,Ral,0,29-May-19, ,I went by the reviews and unfortunately regretted it. I ended up with a dry face with patchy white flakes and lost money. Did not work for me.

1039,Amazon Customer,1,31-Jan-18, ,Amazing product! My hands were severely dry  red  cracked  even bleeding and in pain from the cold and this was the only thing that helped! Finally healing. Also use it on my face. I used to have oily skin so I was always afraid to use thick moisturizers on my face but this has restored my skin! Using it on my 6 month old as well who has dry skin/rash from all her drool!
1040,Heather,1,14-Aug-17, ,I love the way this feels  especially on my hands. It was a little too heavy to use under my makeup  or maybe I was using too much. Either way  it went on smoothly when I mixed my foundation with it before applying.
1041,Amazon Customer,1,10-Dec-18, ,I use this on my face every day and i love it. it’s a HUGE tub that will literally last you years and years if u only apply to your face. perfect for dry skin and such a good price
1042,Andrew B.,1,09-Apr-19, ,I have to shave my face/neck at least once every 2-3 days for my job. I do not use shaving gel or cream or after shave. I rub this cream on my face after my shave and shower. Love how it moisturizes and gives my skin a good healthy texture

1044,DB63,1,08-May-19, ,The best moisturizer on the market!
1045,Ry,1,05-Jun-19, ,This moisturizer feels thick but once I apply it to my skin  it absorbs right in. It’s not heavy to my skin and it doesn’t fell like I have layer of oil on my skin. There is no scent to it. I do like this product so far
1046,Pat,1,06-Jan-19, ,My dermatologist recommended this. So far  so good. Not that greasy and not heavily perfumed. Seems to be more effective when used regularly.
1047,kvitka83,1,28-Dec-16, ,This cream is the life saver for people with sensitive  breakout prone skin. I switched completely to CeraVe skin care abour two years ago. I have since tried other products but keep going back to CeraVe. Absorbs very well  moisturizes and leaves skin soft and supple.

1050,fong718,1,13-Feb-17, ,this works well with our kids that has eczema. best one for us so far. There s a few other brands we like  but this is best. You have to test it with your kids or yourself to find out which is best for you.
1051,Leigh Prelesnick,1,26-Apr-19, ,This helps my dry skin so much
1052,2 Many Paths,1,11-Sep-14, ,Cream that will do the job...no matter how dry your skin is. I prefer this over all. I was using Hydrocerin...this iis way better. NOT GREASY AT ALL!! they must put powder or something in it to take it away. Leaves skin amazingly soft. I highly recommend this products to diabetics...this is the only product that has helped my black ashy elbows...without the greasiness.

1055,James W. Young,1,11-Mar-14, ,Here in Arizona dry skin is a problem. My dermatologist recommended CeraVe  which is much better than the previous skin cream my previous dermatologist recommended. It sinks in and doesn t stay greasy. I used to buy it at Costco  where it s a little cheaper  but I d have to stand in the slow pharmacy line only to find it was out of stock. And the pump  available separately  makes using it much neater.
1056,Taresh Bajaj,1,10-Aug-16, ,Much better suited for my 7 month old than other brands like Aveeno baby or crappy Johnson & Johnson  which my doctor asked to throw in trash. She had minor eczema which was increasing slowly and then our doctor suggested Cera Ve products. We got CeraVe lotion which worked well  but when it got over we got CeraVe Moisturizer and saw rapid improvement. All those eczema spots are now completely gone! Happy with the purchase and would highly recommend! This is our baby s moisturizer for years to come.
1057,GypsyOwl,1,13-Mar-19, ,Works for my lady who has sensitive skin and eczema.

1061,Cristina Santiago,1,02-Jun-19, ,My favorite moisturizer of all time.
1062,Amazon Customer,1,13-Mar-19, ,Originally bought for facial use  the cream never really completely absorbs or dries down but that s the price you pay for intense moisture like this. Have been also using on my dry hands and it works excellently.
1063,Princess Sophia,1,31-May-18, ,I love this product and have ordered it several times. This time  however  some of the cream was on the OUTSIDE of the container. Ugh. Very messy.
1064,AmazonGrl,1,05-Jan-16, ,I have been using an acne topical treatment that severely dries out my skin so my derm recommended I use Cera Ve to combat the dryness. It has by far exceeded my expectations! It seems thick and greasy but once it is on your skin  it is absorbed and not greasy at all. It keeps my skin moisturized all day. Can t say enough good things!
1065,Jesus A Diaz Ramirez,1,20-Apr-19, ,It’s really good. I have oily skin so I usually break out when I wear lotion but Cerave has seemed to fix that issue!
1066,Tim E.,1,22-May-19, ,This is a great unscented body cream. It does observe into the skin quickly and doesn t make akin uncomfortably oily.

1074,S. Sumner,1,23-Jul-18, ,This is a staple in my house. Love this more than any moisturizing cream I ve ever tried.
1075,AX,0,03-Jul-19, ,I should have known better than to purchase something with acids in it. I have sensitive skin and this burned the heck out of my cheeks when I applied it. I do not recommend it for anyone with sensitive  dry skin.
1076,a980,1,21-Nov-13, ,So far  it s been magical to apply this cream. My skin just soaks it all up and it s been responding well. It feel creamy even after you ve washed your hands  so I really hope there s no poisonous mineral in the cream because it isn t gonna leave your skin any time soon. There is no fragrance to it but the lightness of it all makes you think it is fragrant - so five stars for illusion-making! More updates when the winter becomes severe.
1077,Ksu,1,03-Dec-18, ,It s a great cream  easily absorbs and you don t feel the skin is only afterwards.
1078,John F,1,28-May-19, ,Love it  lasts forever  makes my skin radiant  helps with the razor bumps and makes sure my sensitive skin is in good shape.
1079,wendy11tom,1,13-May-18, ,This cream helped me with the dry skin I faced in the winter months by keeping it moist and less itching.
1080,IsabelG,1,26-Apr-19, ,Finally a cream for my skin type  its very light but moisturizing. Its best applied when your skin is still a bit wet and moisturizes all day.

1095,Breanna,1,16-May-19, ,Very long lasting
1096,Jean Winters,1,22-Nov-17, ,I use Vanicream cleansers for my oily but delicate aging skin. However  this beats Vanicream for moisurizing creams. It is not as heavy as Vanicream
1097,Amazon Customer,1,15-Mar-19, ,Works well on scaly skin.
1098,E.M,1,14-Oct-18, ,This is the only lotion I use on not only my arms and legs  but my face. This does not cause breakouts and is great for dry patches  dry skin in general  exzema  discoloration  and daily moisturizing. This lasts awhile and a little goes a long way. I would 10/10 reccomend.
1099,Rcstan,1,12-Jun-17, ,A very heavy cream but is the best I ve ever used. I use it primarily at night and a lighter less greasy moisturizer during the day. I have very dry skin that is easily irritated but this cream has done wonders for me.
1100,X. ZHANG,1,28-Jan-18, ,Keeps skin moisture and restores its barrier. The best lotion I ever have had. My skin is getting much better since using it.

1103,Diana,1,04-May-19, ,Ability to moisturize
1104,Tsu,1,27-May-16, ,Thick  creamy moisturizing cream. This lotion is so moisturizing in fact  that even after I bathe my 4 yr old (who has a fairly serious eczema condition)  he ll feel slippery like an eel coming out of the bath. Lotion really lasts. Definitely recommend it.
1105,LJ,1,04-Jul-14,One person found this helpful,Amazing product! Great for eczema! For me  it works almost as well as the steroid creams in quieting down flare ups. It works great in combo with steroid creams. I love applying this cream after I wash my hands. It keeps them from drying out and it smells nice  in a natural  non-perfumed way. I love this cream.
1106,SS,1,21-Feb-19, ,It softens like nothing I’ve tried before.

1111,B D S,1,20-Apr-17,One person found this helpful,Recommended to me by a dermatologist. Best moisturizing cream I ve ever used. A bit pricey but worth it.

1115,Deshanda R Goss,1,22-Feb-19, ,Very thick leaves skin very moisturized  u will not have to reapply
1116,BigXor,1,01-Nov-14, ,Dry Skin? This is the best. Doesn t leave you greasy feeling and is water soluble. Has a low perfume scent that even men will appreciate because the scent goes away quickly.  After showering I massage a gob of this into a wet washcloth and cover my body from head to foot. After it dries it keeps your skin moisturized and feeling clean.
1117,Aaron Ortega,1,07-Feb-17,One person found this helpful,I was spending $20 for 4 ounces of crappy moisturizer that didn t make my face feel hydrated. This product is great.

1122,mahpimiza,1,01-Aug-15, ,My son has very bad eczema as a baby and we tried everything and so far this is the only thing we used for his skin and his skin has cleared up a lot. We keep his skin soft with this and will continue to use this forever since other lotion (aveeno  johnson&johnson cetephil) makes his skin have rashes.
1123,Connie Brinkmann,1,15-Sep-18, ,This is a great product and available several places. Now I shop for price.

I would not hesitate to purchase from this company again.

1134,RoRo,1,03-May-19, ,Love CeraVe. My dermatologist recommended CeraVe for my dry skin. This cream Absorbs immediately and  it’s super moisturing. I apply after showering on daily basis. There’s no scent  so I add a few drops of essential oil. Definitely recommend.

1136,Sauce Gun,1,02-Apr-19, ,Finally a cream that works!!!
1137,Finley,1,23-Oct-14, ,I recently found out that I m allergic to propylene glycol  and this was one of the few products available to me that was also great for my toddler who has eczema. It s very emollient as a cream should be with a nice smooth texture. The lotion is also great if you want something a little less rich and thick. I also love that it s cruelty-free.
1138,JTA,1,23-Oct-15, ,I love this moisturizing cream. I was diagnosed with extremely dry skin. The dermatologist recommended this for daily care  and it has really helped me. I would find my skin itchin like crazy  but after using this  not more itching. A word of caution about Amazon s subscription  though. I subscribed this item and it went up 30% from the first purchase. It s important to cross reference pricing from Amazon as it is not always the best price.

1143,JLS,1,08-Nov-14, ,This is a really nice cream from the drugstore. It is non-irritating  is unscented and does its job. I would recommend this for a mild moisturizing cream. I personally prefer the first aid beauty cream to this one so I will buy that one instead  but that one is more expensive. If you are looking for a cheaper option  I would recommend this one!
1144,Hipmoma,1,01-Sep-17, ,Amazing cream  love it. Makes my skin feel fresh and relaxed right away. Helps with itchy skin and dry eye lids. Really good deal for this hug pot.
1145,Jenelle Harri,1,18-Oct-18, ,I bought this moisturizer for my face but it was a little too thick for my liking however on my body it felt great. I love applying it to my legs after shaving.

1150,Wilfredo ubardo,1,05-Jan-18, ,I ve tried many other creams and always seen to remain ashy skin after a few hours. With these lotion I can go 24 hrs or between showers not needing to reapply. Best m works best if used right after the shower when the skin is a little bit most. It doesn t leave and oily skin but utt may feel a bit heavy if you apply more than one coat
1151,ALB,1,05-Feb-17, ,i use this cream every day after my shower. My skin is dry and this makes it feel nice a soft. I used to use Cetaphil and still use their cleanser for my face but for my body   I perfer this cream.

1167,Greedy Petey,1,20-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,I am surprised how well this works and why no doctor recommends this. One tub is basically a lifetime supply. All you need to do is add a drop onto your skin and it just works.
1168,W. Guy,1,09-Jul-13, ,I m a guy and super picky about lotions that either advertise as fragrance-free and fail miserably or leave skin feeling like there is a layer you could peel off. This lotion is as advertised. It s awesome. You get more than what you pay for. The moisturizing effects last 2-3 days per single application. You ll definitely feel a difference if you stop using it for 2-3 days (or more). It s the perfect daily moisturizer.
1169,kelly mcneal,1,20-Apr-19, ,Best moisturizer for the price!
1170,Jax,0,11-Mar-19, ,I really wanted this cream to work for me. Multiple naturopaths insisted I buy for my highly sensitive and dry skin. Alas - within two days of using  I could tell it s not for me. The skin of my face freaked out  became red  irritated  and even more dry. I will be throwing away.
1171,4plainsmen108,1,15-Oct-17, ,This is the only non greasy lotion that actually holds up even in water. This stuff is the bomb and not just for its hypoallergenic properties which why i bought it.

Most lotions lack at least one if not two of the components. This is the least expensive of the best quality lotions. I had dry cracking heels which are almost all healed.

1201,Jennifer,1,12-Jun-11,One person found this helpful,While I haven t been formally diagnosed  I suspect I have a mild case of eczema. The itching was irritating and the scaly skin patches were disgusting  but using this product makes a tremendous difference. It s still there  but it so well reduced that only I can see it. It also doesn t itch anymore. It s not a cure  but it is much better than cortizone or neosporin  which is what I had been using previously.
1202,cbbop,1,27-Oct-16,One person found this helpful,Been using this for years. The only thing slightly changed is the packaging. Great stuff and way less expensive on-line that in my local CVS

1211,Jillian B.,1,25-Jan-19, ,My skin would still be dry and flaky in the winter when I used lotion so I switched to a cream. This is the best moisturizer I’ve ever used. There’s no smell and it’s not greasy. I use it head to toe daily and I’m going to buy this cream every winter.
1212,T. Jolly,1,21-Feb-14,One person found this helpful,I have dry skin and intermittent eczema/dermatitis on my hands (lifelong). Personally I find this one of the better creams. Cetaphil I find quite greasy and somewhat irritating. Cerave seems less greasy  and better absorbed/tolerated by my skin. Clearly this is a very individual thing  but for me it works great.
1213,amy23,1,30-Jan-19, ,Very creamy and soaks in wonderfully
1214,Susanne,1,27-Dec-16, ,I love this stuff. It is the only way I get through the winter. I use on my body and my face. My daughter has eczema and uses it to combat the spots when they get so bad in the winter.
1215,Gabriella,1,15-Sep-14, ,I bought this to use in the The Regimen for acne instead of the products that come in their bundle (which cost me 20.00 total and saved me 24.00!). I have used CeraVe products before but this moisturizing cream is by far the best one I have ever used. It s extremely thick and you can feel the moisture sink into your skin but also hydrating your skin through out the day. You don t need a lot of it so I know that this jar is going to last me easily 6 months  however if you have really dry skin you can use this stuff all over your body. It s really great!

1227,kuoch,1,29-Aug-17, ,The only cream I tried that really helps my super dry skin condition  and prevents skin from cracking up especially in winter time.
1228,Cheyenne,1,12-Mar-15, ,Have used CeraVe for years & can t imagine any better cream for me. Really helps moisturize my skin without an oily feel or heavy feel.

1244,LISA,1,23-May-17,4 people found this helpful,We use this to treat our child who has eczema. Our pediatric dermatologist educated us on the importance of ceremides in rebuilding the outer layer of skin for eczema sufferers. We have turned to this cream after our favorite was pulled from the shelves-it is a good substitute; however  for severe eczema-the thicker the cream  the better. We wish this company would come out with a thicker cream! For now-this is nice--it doesn t burn  so many creams do burn skin with eczema.

1255,Erica Lynn,0,03-Jul-18,3 people found this helpful,I wanted to be just as obsessed with this moisturizer as everyone else. I tried for so long to love it. I tried to pretend like it wasn t giving me gnarly closed comedones all over my jaw and forehead. I tried to pretend like it wasn t stinging my face & making me a greasy monster 2 hours into the day. Regardless of how hard I tried  this moisturizer and I do not get along. I think it s great for so many other people  so I couldn t give it a one star  but in my eyes  it s a 1 star moisturizer. I don t even like to use it on my hands  because it makes them so greasy as well. It s a hard no from me.

This is the closest product I have found that compares to the buttery-ness and smoothing texture. It doesn t really have a scent which is great for everyday wear. I usually put it on directly out of the shower when my skin is a bit damp  it helps the cream spread and really absorbs well.
1346,Karen,1,01-Mar-14, ,That this stuff seems to work. I used it on one hand for two weeks and compared hands. The hand with the CeraVe was smoother and looked  well  younger. I have been using it on my hands  face  and neck. I usually like to use products that are more natural  and I wish it contained a sunscreen  but this product is worth a try.
1347,Nadisha,1,21-Dec-16, ,Bought this a couple days ago for my ashy skin. Couldn t get anything to work for awhile. Now I m smoothly moisterized. Couldn t be happier ! Skin looks and feels great!!!
1348,Partyof5,1,28-Jun-19, ,Wonderful!
1349,BODYMATE,1,06-Jun-18, ,One of the best moisturizer! Not just for babies but works perfect on adults too :)
1350,Sand,0,23-Jun-18, ,I wanted to like this product  but it is full of parabens.
1351,Sinqobile,1,28-Aug-18,One person found this helpful,This product has worked wonders for me! My face dehydration lines have completely disappeared. Looking forward trying CeraVe Sunscreen for the face and the hydrating Face Wash!
1352,Coral,1,20-Dec-18, ,Love it
1353,Sctrojan_81,1,21-Sep-15,3 people found this helpful,Received today but it should be Pack of 3 and received only 1 in the package.
1354,Coco,1,23-Dec-13,7 people found this helpful,It s definitely a great product at this price  I should say. I applied it to both face and body in the wintertime and the results are a bit different: when using it on the face  it would keep it moist for quite a longer time  much longer than you thought with this price  but less than the stronger facial creams which can sustain a whole day rather than half day as this product does. Besides  my face skin is a bit sensitive to it and may turn red after a while...as for the body lotion  it s just great. It can keep your skins smooth and moist for a whole night even in such dry weather. So  overall  it s a very nice cream and I like it.
1355,Dan & T. Martin,1,08-Mar-16, ,Great for hands  zero greasy residue like Vaseline. It soaks in fast  lives up to its claim of no fragrance. But this stuff doesn t have enough moisture for cracked & dry skin on feet. IT WORKED: My eczema lessened.
1356,Nancy B.,1,23-Mar-19, ,I used it on my skin.
1357,Wendy,1,15-Sep-18, ,The best body and face cream ever.
1358,Ramon Plaza,0,21-Mar-18, ,I’ve been using it for almost a month and the only difference I’ve noticed is that my skin tone is getting darker. My face looks as if I spent a couple hours in the sun. I used to be undercooked and now I look like I spent one too many minutes in the over. Not the result I was looking for
1359,Amazon Customer,1,03-Jul-19, ,Love this product ... not sticky like other moisturizers … very light feeling and makes your dry skin so soft. I will definitely buy this again.
1360,Avery Nwokike,1,24-Jan-18, ,I would rather it have a smell than the medicinal smell it has but it works well.

1367,Ariana Robinson,1,23-Sep-18, ,Super Moisturizing. I used this with my acne wash with benzol peroxide which is supposedly supposed to dry your face out but I did not have any drying out my skin while using this product
1368,Teags,1,18-Sep-15, ,Best lotion ever! I use on my face because I have rosacea and sensitive skin. Great for all over the body. I have tried just about every lotion out there from ultra expensive to drugstore and this is by far the most calming and moisturizing.
1369,Jessica,1,03-Jan-18, ,Good price! I always use this for my psoriosis. I have DRY skin and this is the only thing that keeps it normal.
1370,BHAnderson,1,02-Mar-15,One person found this helpful,I like it. I am a man who sufers from Eczema and I hate putting lotion on my body  but I like the way this feels on my skin. I use it to shave with. We are all different..it is more of a   to each his own  thing.
1371,Amazon Dude,1,05-Dec-17, ,Love it! I suffer from eczema and this lotion helps keep my skin moisturized!!!  Highly recommend!
1372,Dennis,1,09-May-19, ,Wife uses this all the time. She has tried other products but keeps coming back to this one

1376,nonsensely,1,09-Aug-14,One person found this helpful,Recommended by my dermatologist for dry patches  this cream is rich  yet easy to spread and never greasy. Within three weeks of using  all the rough/dry spots were gone. I ve purchased the day and night facial cream and the face wash and love them all.
1377,Bffrosey,1,07-Apr-19, ,Great product. I had a patch of eczema that wasn’t healing and I can see it gradually healing after a weeks use. I have weaned myself off of prescription eczema medications. This product is great for managing eczema.
1378,Ann,1,08-Jul-16,One person found this helpful,My skin was getting so dry and I remembered a few years ago I used this product. It works great. I got a 2 pack and so glad I did as I use this all the time on my legs and arms.

1387,agaD,1,02-Jan-17, ,I ve been using ceraVe products for my eczema prone babies  there s no parabens or fragrance so it doesn t irritate sensitive skin.Makes skin super soft.

1389,Pin Hui Wang,1,21-Jul-18, ,Very good to protect the skin. But maybe better to use it in winter

1394,Diana Lawhorn,1,18-Mar-19, ,I decided to try CERA VE on the eczema rash . I cant say the product cleared it  but using this several times daily relieved that intense itching-there is no redness. Good price is another nice feature.
1395,V.J.,1,18-Jun-17, ,best cream on the market - would not do without it... have used this product for about 7 years - does a wonderful job.
1396,Amazon Customer,1,07-Jan-19, ,Good
1397,Amazon Customer,1,30-Jan-19, ,This lotion is my new favorite! I especially love using it on my face. It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturizer  without feeling oily at all! I use it on my toddlers’ dry faces and it has been wonderful on their gentle skin!
1398,B. Montgomery,1,01-Jan-16,One person found this helpful,This cream was recommended by my dermatologist for my extremely dry skin. It is a really nice cream  not oily  goes on nicely and does help with my dry skin.
1399,Lucille McGinnis,1,17-Mar-17, ,It absorbs almost immediately and doesn t leave any shine or oily look. My husband uses it on his face even. I use it as a body cream.
1400,tbyrd,1,19-Jan-16, ,Ok  you wouldn t dream...usually to use this as a dual product for your face and feet...lol. But  I do. I use it on my face  then I put it on my clean feet  then put on socks. Both are super soft when I wake up.
1401,maria l mejia,0,12-Mar-18, ,i want to remove this item for my list i dont wanted any more please
1402,Mark,1,22-Dec-18, ,I was suffering from severe dry flaky skin on areas of my face around my nose  eyebrows  under and over top and bottom lips. This cold weather made it worsen. After trying several different brands this stuff works I would recommend this to anyone with red flakey dry skin.
1403,erik strandquist,1,19-Jul-18, ,heavy  moisture-rich cream. best as an overnight cream. nice price point to quality ratio.
1404,Junieb,1,13-Mar-19, ,My skin tends to dry out really bad in the winter  I’ve tried gold bond  aveeno  coconut oil etc. nothing seemed to help. This is the only product so far that keeps my skin moisturized thru out the day!
1405,Holly,1,31-Jul-15, ,I bought their heaviest lotion (cream moisturizer) and it is really good. Works good like my other favorite  but this one is not sticky. It dries quickly and doesnt melt in the heat either. I used it under makeup just fine. But could argue that Because its their heaviest cream  it dries a little tacky ( like thin waxy). Its the best one i have tried!
1406,Kimberly Mari Holder,1,26-Nov-18, ,Product is great!! Going to start buying it all the time.
1407,Bubba Red,1,01-Jul-18, ,very good product - my skin is very smooth now 
1408,David,1,21-Apr-18, ,This works for my dry skin & not much else does
1409,SM,1,06-Sep-18, ,very good but expensive
1410,Bethany,1,22-Oct-14, ,I use it nightly  after applying any AHA products- and my skin has improved due to the CeraVe  especially on my legs and backs of my arms. The thickness can feel a bit weird on the face  but it hasn t caused any breakouts. Even after waking  I can still feel some of the product on my body/face- So it keeps me from getting too dried out as it s getting cooler.
1411,SR - Maryland,1,16-Jan-14, ,I bought this on the recommendation of my dermatologist s office as an OTC replacement for a prescription cream (Mimyx) that was the best thing I d ever found to help my dry skin but which was no longer covered by my insurance plan. The CeraVe isn t as emollient or long lasting as the other cream  but it s pretty good and I like that it has no smell at all.
1412,Bernie,1,20-Apr-19, ,I use it every day as a face moisturizer. It s perfect! Doesn t break me out  irritates my very sensitive skin or burns. A+ in my book!
1413,Robin M. Ricks,1,01-Feb-19, ,The product is great. HOWEVER  the packaging wasn’t well done. The rim on the lid was broken  so the lid won’t stay on. I’ve used the cream because it is my favorite moisturizer. I suggest you talk to the vendor. Robin Ricks
1414,Ferdiana A. CHERY,1,28-Mar-19, ,My skin was so dry and I can say it’s moisturize now
1415,beecee,1,11-Dec-13, ,The dermatologist recommended this to my wife to cure simple dry hands but I ve found it works great to keep my severe eczema from flaring up on my hands. It s not greasy and works great for daily use. I m glad I found this one and looks like it will last a long time with frequent use. This is now my moisturizer!
1416,Bruce Thongkham,1,20-Jul-18, ,Shipped fast and Good item
1417,Amazon Customer,1,14-Jul-18, ,Consistency is thicker compared to other lotions  but It goes on smooth  intensely hydrates  and greatly decreases acne. Who knew?!
1418,Amazon Customer,1,22-May-19, ,Excellent product!
1419,T. Herbst,1,16-Oct-18, ,Miracle moisturizer that does everything as advertised.
1420,G Termin,1,26-May-17, ,Love this cream. I am a senior woman and have tried a lot of lotions for dry flaky skin and this one does the trick.
1421,ShadyLady Portland,1,03-Aug-16, ,I ve used CeraVe for over a year now...what a difference over the extra moisturizing lotions I was using. Not greasy  absorbs well  and I m not troubled by dry  crepey skin. I use it as a body moisturizer at least every morning  and am so pleased with the improvement in my skin tone and comfort. Not bad  for the over 60 crowd!
1422,Britney Mae,1,22-Mar-19, ,I don’t usually write reviews. But for this I had to. My face is dramatically changed!!! For everyone that has dry skin  you NEED this!! I recommended to all my friends

1425,AL - NYC,1,20-Feb-18, ,light weight moisturizer. I like that it is not perfumed
1426,NICOLETTE M. BAKER,1,21-Jan-14, ,I have seborrhea  and my dermatologist recommended CeraVe for my skin. I use steroids when it flares up  but for the rest of the time I need a super hydrating cream. CeraVe is the only one that has worked for me. I have tried dozens of  wonderful  creams that did absolutely nothing to diminish my patches of red scaly skin. In fact  most of them only exacerbated the areas. Within one week of using this product  the patches got less scaly. By two weeks  most of the scale was gone  and the red patches began lightening. Anyone who has rough dry skin (my is soft but extremely dry) should absolutely buy this product.
1427,yadira lopez,1,14-Aug-18, ,Best moisturizer.
1428,Phyllis Wells,1,08-Dec-18, ,With the cold temps and dry air this cream is great for moisturizing my skin. My dermatologist recommended using this.

1432,Mary Kaitlyn Word,1,03-Jan-19, ,Works great for my dehydrated skin! I love that it’s fragrance free!
1433,Stephanie K.,1,22-Sep-18, ,Feels great on my skin. I do have some acne and have a lot of oil so I don t put a lot on my face. But I feel plump and hydrated every time I use it!
1434,Percy Y.,1,12-Dec-18, ,Been using this for 2 years plus. keeping my family s skin moist & protected. Not much scent which is what I wanted.
1435,SteveGS,1,30-Mar-15, ,This stuff is great! Purchased as an alterative to neutrogena face lotion and am very pleased. Seems like the 16oz tub will last a long time. I also like that it doesnt need a pump. Pumps tend to get gross and make lotion boogers which seem to be a waste of lotion and annoying.
1436,Sugarnliza,1,13-Apr-17, ,I love this cream..heavy enough to really moisturize but so much that it feel heavy (if that makes sense). Also  not oily- really soaks into your skin for lasting relief.
1437,Amazon Customer,1,13-Jul-18, ,Simply the best body cream ever!!! I have used it my entire pregnancy and not one single stretch mark!!!

1441,Mary D.,0,04-Mar-19, ,I don t know if this product is fake or what  but this is burning my face! Maybe it has to do with all the alcohols in it or maybe I m just sensitive? The consistency is nice and its not too greasy  too bad...

1457,Ron Elliott,1,03-Nov-16, ,CeraVe is the best product of its type on the market  It s a source of serious chemical ingredients; the question is which formulation is best for your needs. The price is amazing .
1458,Stefano,1,25-Oct-15, ,I find CeraVe Moisturizing Cream to be an excellent product. I ve purchased moisturizing creams from L Occitane at more than twice the price with inferior results. CeraVe lasts  is easily applied and dries relatively quickly.
1459,C. Foley,1,12-Sep-18, ,I love this product. Very light and creamy. I bought this to replace the Aveeno I had been using and this is SO much better.
1460,Madison,1,13-Jan-18, ,Kinda feels weird when you put it on  but saves your face.
1461,Kukiya,1,14-Mar-16, ,My daughter has very dry skin and eczema. Cerave does a great job moisturizing her skin. And makes it so soft as well. We tried all kind of lotion and so far Cerave is what helps my daughter s skin the best along with coconut oil. My husband also has very dry skin and uses it on a daily basis.

1474,JP,1,16-Apr-18, ,the best face cream on the market
1475,Ryan De La Hunt,1,23-Mar-14, ,Bought this as a nighttime moisturizer for an acne prone teen. It is non-comodogenic  meaning it will not clog pores. I do not recommend it for daytime use seeing as it is greasy if used in anything other than the smallest amounts. That aside  it is a powerful moisturizer for both the face and the body. If you are using it for your body only  there are other products that may serve you better seeing as they don t need to be non-comodogenic to moisturize your feet  for example. For my application  it is probably the best product I ve found.
1476,rose,1,20-Feb-17, ,Been ordering this almost monthly! Making my skin smooth day by day. I use it on my face too. So far so good! Happy face!

1495,KS Senior,1,18-May-13, ,I read an article written by a dermatologist that recommended the ingredients in this cream. I have been using it for several months now. It is inexpensive compared to other products and works well for dry skin. I also use it as a night cream for my face and will continue that routine since it works for me
1496,Nikki,1,18-Apr-19, ,I am allergic to everything  I have never had a reaction to this and use it on my face and body. It is also moisturizing enough for my feet!

1500,Tyler,1,20-Jun-17, ,Couldn t ask for a better moisturizer. I really appreciate that I don t need to use a lot of it for the cream to be effective

1540,Claire,1,18-Jun-15, ,The best moisturizing cream on the market  no contest. Recommended by my dermatologist and I will never be without it. For extremely dry  or damaged skin  this cream works magic  and does it quickly. It s worth the price.
1541,Nanette Beall,1,27-Mar-19, ,65 years of dry skin  I ve tried many different brands. This lotion is by far the best. It relieves the dryness but also leaves a softness others do not.

1546,Wisdom Seeker,1,23-Nov-15, ,My dermatologist recommended Cerave as part of my post-shower routine to lock in moisture in my fight against eczema/dry skin. So much easier to apply this than Eucerin which is just to thick and oily.
1547,Amazon Customer,1,15-Jan-19, ,Great moisturizer.
1548,Taj,1,16-Aug-15, ,During winter this is the only thing that will keep my hands and feet from getting dry. Very mild scent and absorbs well. I ve been using this product for a number of years and have always had good results.
1549,Alice Becker,1,14-Oct-14,3 people found this helpful,I ve been using CeraVe at the recommendation of my dermatologist for years. I absolutely love it and I know it sounds silly but it has really changed my life. My skin isn t itchy or tight or maddening anymore. It may not be the solution to everyone s skin problem but if you have chronic eczema it is a MUST TRY.  Tip: Give it a week or two to really start working. You need to let the healthy skin grow in under the damaged skin.

1555,Victoria,1,20-Feb-17, ,It s very moisturizing  non-irritating  and doesn t take long to absorb. I used to use the THICK Eucetin that comes in a jar. I love the Eucerin  but rubbing it in is a chore- it s so thick.ThIs is light yet very moisturizing.
1556,Deede,1,24-Apr-15, ,I love CeraVe products  particularly this moisturizing cream. As someone who attempts to take good care of their skin and slow down the signs of aging I find that this cream contains the ingredients necessary to do just that.
1557,Amazon Customer,1,10-Aug-14,One person found this helpful,I like this cream. It seems to work well but it is for my mother-in-law and she doesn t tell anything other than it is  fine . The only complaint I have is that the container opened during shipping. There was a shrink wrap around the jar so it didn t spill out.
1558,Carrie Spencer,1,18-Nov-17, ,This cream is good to keep your skin moisturized. My husband is diabetic and it works very well for him.
1559,chadwick007,1,22-Dec-14,2 people found this helpful,After trying maybe 25 different products for my then  1 year old daughter s sensitive skin/eczema  this is the ONLY product that pretty much cured her condition! From maybe  the time my daughter was 1 month old  she would always have patches of eczema and nothing seemed to work. We tried prescription creams  ointments  bathing her every single day  only bathing her weekly  oatmeal baths.... etc. Seriously  I ordered so many products and we went to so many doctors in her first year of life that it was ridiculous. Then  I found this miracle cream!! Why  didn t I find this stuff sooner? Ever since we ve been using this stuff on her skin; it s now been 2 years  she has never  ever had eczema again. We moisturize her whole body with it in the morning and at night and her skin  honestly looks so nice. Her skin is so smooth  soft and beautiful.

1568,Avid Reader,1,25-May-14,3 people found this helpful,I bought this after I read an article by a dermatologist about products that are safe to use for rosacea. I am so glad I did. I ve been using this product for about a month now and my flare-ups have been greatly diminished. I ve even been able to reintroduce some of my anti-aging products like retinol and vitamin C that I had stopped because it seemed they irritated my skin. In the morning  I put on my Vitamin C serum and let it dry for a few minutes before putting the CeraVe on. I let it absorb for at least 5 minutes before putting makeup or anything else over it. I do the same thing at night with the retinol. So far  it has worked really well for me. I also use the CeraVe skin cleanser. My skin looks better than it has in months. Thanks!
1569,EleDank,1,06-Jan-16,One person found this helpful,Love this.. goes on smooth  not too thick like some of them. I like that it doesn t have that much of a smell or after odor.

1573,Marzo,1,09-Apr-19, ,I love how it heals my very dry skin. It goes on thick but spreads nicely. This jar will last me for awhile. Great price!
1574,JT,0,04-Jan-17, ,My dermatologist prescribed me Retin-A 0.1% and during my appointment he advised that I use only the Retin-A along with a dedicated moisturizer  and so he recommended CeraVe. I bought the generic CeraVe Moisturizing Cream in the tub thinking it was a stellar value for being recommended by a dermatologist. Huge. Mistake.  Applying this stuff made my face immediately feel like I had used it to put out a grease fire. It was truly painful enough that I was on the the verge of tears. To add insult to injury  this made me very oily and seemed to  float  on my skin without ever absorbing - almost like a heavy occlusive. In search of relief  I would park my face in front of an industrial fan for 15-20 minutes each time I applied this cream. Despite the pain  I continued to do this for almost 2 months since I believed it was what the dermatologist recommended. After the initial tretinoin purging period died down (about 6 weeks)  I continued to get localized breakouts and intense sebacious filaments exactly like I had been getting before the Retin-A. The gist I received from my doctor is that this should not happen (as the purging is an allover zitfest  you shouldn t notice specific problems areas once the purging stops).  It was logically determined that this moisturizer was causing me problems. Turns out when the dermatologist recommended CeraVe  he specifically meant CeraVe s Facial Moisturizing Lotion PM. Ugh. I switched to that product immediately and it was a complete 180. No burning  no breaking out  relief from the dry skin and sensitivity  and a huge reduction in sebacious filaments. Almost 3 weeks without the Moisturizing Cream holding me back  my skin had actually progressed enough for the dermatologist to recommend I move up to the strongest possible retinoid. The dermatologist thinks that my reaction was caused by the high content of cetyl alcohol found in the CeraVe Moisturizing Cream  which coincidentally is not found in the PM lotion.  Anyways  the tub is HUGE and I had a lot left over. I didn t want to waste it and found out this is a great body moisturizer that combats winter dryness. I ve noticed nicer looking and feeling skin on my arms and chest... I d recommend it for that purpose.  Just don t put it on your face!

1585,K. R. Licata,1,14-Aug-13,One person found this helpful,I was recommended to use the CeraVe moisturizing cream since I have started taking Claravis (accutane) which makes my face really dry and flaky. It works alright  but I still get a few flakes on my face. I am also not a big fan of the creamy feeling.  I recommend this product for those who do have dry skin and do not mind the creamy feeling.

1614,poe1013,1,14-Sep-16,2 people found this helpful,I am currently battling an adult onset eczema flare up (multiple types all over). I have never had any eczema problems in the past so I m pretty new to this. The doctor prescribed steroid cream for the numular and dyshidrotic eczema but wanted me to try a cream on the more sensitive areas (stomach and neck  ect.). All I can say is I m actually glad for the flare up because if not for that  I never would have known this stuff existed. Even the non-effected areas (like my face) look so much better than before. I am hooked for life even if my eczema never returns!  I also used it on husband who has vericose eczema from poor circulation after a damage from a blood clot years ago. Tried everything to prevent the scaly  thick dead skin from forming and nothing ever really cut it (even pure emu oil). Use this and after one night  the dead skin started coming off and within 4 days it was gone!  I m thinking about to switching my complete skin care line to to this!!

1625,Tyson Alexander,1,23-Oct-17, ,Really good stuff!  Even though there s more to my fountain of youth regiment than this cream --- this is a big part of it. So I m 35 years old and I m getting to that awkward age where I m starting to lose my youthful look. That being said  I ve always been a good looking guy and in just the past few years whether I m going into a coffee shop or the grocery store I ve noticed I m not getting the looks from the girls like I use to.  I m sure I m not the only if your looking up reviews on a product that supposedly makes you look younger.... am I right... or am I right!?  Anyways lol.. So I totally recommend washing your face before putting on this cream. I actually give my face a good scrub with water or rubbing alcohol and then I put it on my face before or right after I get into the shower. The effects of this cream when you already have moist skin from the shower will amplify the effects of the cream. YOU DON t NEED ALOT OF IT - just a little dab  I wouldn t put this cream on over a dirty face - that s probably more so advice for the male reviewers and not the ladies but I think you get my point. I started to see better results with the cream has a fresh canvass to work from. I only put it once a day in the morning during a shower and it lasts all day.  Something that will enhance your skin along with this cream is if you take marine collagen in the morning with Orange Juice. OJ will enhance the collagen s effectiveness and I take marine collagen because it resembles human collagen more so than others out there on the market.  These 2 things will take your skin a long ways!

1645,fatmonkey,1,12-May-14,One person found this helpful,My skin turned really dry during winter. I have tried different thick moisturizer. This one is the best. It is not oily  and it put a nice coat on the skin so it won t dry out even after many hours. Highly recommended.
1646,Rweezy,1,22-Oct-15, ,I wash my hands numerous times each day  which causes my hands to become extremely dry throughout the day. This is the first product that I ve been able to find which helps keep my hands moisturized throughout the day. I just wish it wasn t so expensive.
1647,havasuhottie,1,31-Jul-17,2 people found this helpful,This product was recommend to us by our skin care provider  a professional dermatologist. We both had skin cancers removed. We live in Sunny  hot  monsoon Arizona  in a dry desert  year round. Our skin takes a beating and demands great care. My husband has the absolute worst  dry  damaged skin I have ever tried to care for. We have tried many products  mostly useless. This product is absolutely awesome. It is so awesome I told my sister about it; she was recently diagnosed with an allergy to UV rays. This product is an absolute blessing. I recommend it without reservation. The best prices are available through Amazon.com and Prime.
1648,BLT,1,01-Mar-14, ,It is the best moisturizer that I have found. It doesn t feel greasy and it moisturizes my skin. I use it on my legs  arms and hands. I did have to return that last one I purchased from this company as it wasn t sealed and it looked like it had been used.
1649,Amazon Customer,1,13-Dec-15, ,I have had psoriasis my whole life. I now have psoriatic arthritis and receive remicade infusions. With the treatments my skin was so dry; i felt it deep down inside my system. I ve always been a water drinker but i couldn t keep my skin hydrated. I tried a spa  hydrating cleanser and lotion but the products are so expensive. Then after reading an article  i tried Cerave. LOVE IT. My skin hasn t looked or felt tjis great in years and the price is right

1669,Barbara V.,0,25-Dec-15,13 people found this helpful,The wife has cellulitis and this product was recommended by her wound care professional. Unfortunately  like all moisturizing creams on the market  it has petroleum. This product generates heat if rubbed between the skin and something else - like between toes or against clothing. Very bad. She developed contact dermatitis with huge blisters. This product may not be the direct culprit  but she was directed by another wound care professional not to us it or any product with petroleum in it. This is just a general warning about petroleum.
1670,Terri Oliver,1,17-Apr-19, ,Excellent product. If you have dry or sensitive skin  I recommend you give it a try.
1671,Amazon Customer,1,25-Apr-16,One person found this helpful,This product is absolutely amazing....

I have keratosis pilaris (known as chicken skin) its dry rough patches on the back of my arms  thighs and knees this stuff has made it barely noticeable. I ve also been using it on my face because I do break out often and have rosacea. It s made my skin so smooth and some-what clear but like I said I ve only have used it for a week. I will definitely keep using it for better results.

1763,Here to Help,1,22-Aug-15,9 people found this helpful,Is your skin moaning in pain? Do you feel like human sandpaper? Are you looking for a cream so soothing that it makes you almost weep with relief? I don’t know what in the world the name CeraVe means  but they should call it  heaven.  This product is thick and  well  creamy without being sticky the way some glycerin-based products are  and it goes on smoothly and easily. My skin cries for it between applications  especially the backs of hands and forearms  which take the most sun and wind abuse. And the good news is that Amazon carries a number of other CeraVe products??lotion  cleanser  sunscreen  stretch marks cream  baby lotion. My next purchase will be the face cream. About cost  it is not the cheapest cream in the world. The company offers a $2 off coupon on its website  for use at various brick-and-mortar drugstores and Target  so it might be worthwhile to some folks to compare prices; but I am a loyal Prime member and do almost all my shopping at Amazon except for perishables of course. I balance the cost of time and gasoline against occasional savings in price on specific items. And in any case  I am willing to pay a little more for such a fine product. This is a serious cream for seriously dry skin. Nothing fancy. No fragrance. The jar is plain. The product is a blessing.
1764,Paulette G Majors,1,10-Mar-14, ,I don t even buy expensive lotion for myself  but I splurge and get this stuff. The other lotions were not really keeping my twin s skin soft. And one of them had some excema. This cleared everything up. All of my friends use it too and love it.

1772,Willamsburger,1,03-Jul-14, ,My dermatologist recommended this. My face was raw from something or another. It works well as a moisturizer . Some nights I use glycerin instead. It is a lot cheaper and does not have as many chemical ingredients.

1774,Donovan Orow,1,11-Jan-17, ,CeraVe never lets me down. I highly recommend that you use this cream in the winter months and the lotion in the summer months; the cream is more oil-based  and that is what we need during the winter.

1789,R. L. Carr,1,17-Jan-12,2 people found this helpful,First Let me Say... you can get the same 16-oz. jar at Walmart for $12 and change! Secondly  this is the best treatment for dry skin that I ve ever used. I am a 58 year-old male and have always had very dry skin. My hands looked as if I were 80 years old. I have been using the Cerave for about a month now. Once every two days  I will soap up and scrub the tops of my hands with a pot-scrubbing sponge  just to exfoliate. Then I try to use the Cerave 3 times a day. And I have found that putting on a second application after 30-60 minutes makes a big difference. So... after a month  My hands look about five years younger. Hope that trend continues!
1790,Jim,1,08-May-12,2 people found this helpful,I had doubts about this product for curing my Eczema because I ve tried so many ointments and creams over the past year with no relief. In addition the label does not claim to be a cure for this irritating condition. However  after reading some of the reviews  I decided to try it as a last resort before going to a dermatologist. The results were amazing. Within one week of once daily applications  my Eczema began to disappear from my ankles. Within 3 weeks it was gone entirely. I use it in other dry skin places because it is so smooth. I think the 16 oz jar will last over a year.
1791,Kristin,1,05-Aug-14,One person found this helpful,thick and moisturizing! My only issue is sometimes my foundation goes on weird if I ve used too much lotion but otherwise this has been awesome  my thirsty skin drank up the moisture and looks better.
1792,Amazon Customer,1,14-Jul-16, ,I love the CeraVe  but when I opened the product  the top was barely screwed on and it was not properly sealed  like someone else had used it before me.

1881,ladymamma,1,23-Feb-12,4 people found this helpful,This stuff really has worked great on my usually severely chapped hands this winter. They get so bad sometimes that they crack and bleed  but since using the CeraVe every night before bed  they are nothing but happy hands! I think this stuff is great  and only wish that they would take the yucky parabens out of the ingredients  as I am trying to make a real effort to use more natural  paraben-free products  so they lose a star on that account. But you know what  it is worth it to not have painful sore hands all day long  so I figure it is a trade off that makes sense for me. Highly recommend!
1882,Theresa W,1,13-Aug-16, ,I use this as a face moisturizer after my friends dermatologist recommended it. This is a good thick lotion that doesn t leave you feeling sticky.
1883,Amazon Customer,1,01-Aug-18, ,Really thick and moisturizing. It s a great cream to put on at night. My face feels really soft afterwards  and it feels like it s trapping moisture in my skin.

1945,Dinesh Tyagi,1,03-Mar-13,2 people found this helpful,BEST moisturing product! Period.  Looked into it because my dermatologist prescribed EpiCeram for my skin condition and wanted me to use a stronger moisturizing lotion. I checked out the active ingredients for EpiCeram and they consisted of Ceramides  fatty acids and cholesterol. But the product is available by prescription only and I paid $38 for a 90g tube. When I searched for products with Ceramides  I came across CeraVe and ordered this product. I debated between the cream and the lotion but settled on cream because the lotion has more water content and did not feel like paying for water. What an amazing product! I have compared EpiCeram and CaraVe side by side and I like CeraVe hands down. My elbows and heels have never been this smooth. The cream is non greasy and disappears very quickly. I can t believe that a non-greasy cream and moisturize as well as this product. I am hooked for life.

1995,Sarah,1,02-Jul-17, ,I was doing research on the best moisturizing creams out there and stumbled upon this one. I bought a small tube of it from the store and fell in love. I ve been using the product for awhile now and it s probably one of the best moisturizing creams I have ever used. It s not greasy but it is a little thick; however  I kind of like that because it feels like it s doing some real work on my skin. And while it is a thick there s no residue left over. I ve always struggled with dry skin  even eczema at times  and this has been life saver for me during the colder months. I always see reviews about having  mold  in their products or something and worry about that happening to me  but nothing so far (knock on wood!). I ve been extremely satisfied with the timely arrival and condition of the cream. Will continue to purchase through Amazon so I may maintain as limited contact with the outside world as possible! haha

2079,Eve L.,1,24-Aug-14,2 people found this helpful,Absolutely the best eczema cream I have ever used on my daughter. We have tried Aquaphor  Cetaphil and all other parfume free creams. Nothing helped. Aveeno made her eczema even worse. Her face was so bad that we were given a script for a steriod cream. I was so afraid to use it on my baby and as a last resort I tried CeraVe. Someone on my baby discussion board suggested it because it worked on their kids. After only one day  the redness was gone. But after 3 days her face was clear and the itching was gone. My baby is sleeping through the night now. I have also ordered CeraVe bodywash.
2080,Andrew Rabatin,1,13-Feb-14, ,doctor said on my yearly checkup that my skin had improved  so i can recommed this product. not cheap but well worth the money to keep your skin in good condition.
2081,Ann,1,21-Jan-16,One person found this helpful,This is the best cream for eczema I ve found. I had an allergic rash for almost two years that was driving me crazy with pain and itching. Steroid shots only helped for a week or so. I reverted to steroid creams which would reduce the itching and red patches but did nothing to heal my skin. By adding this to the steroid cream regimen I was able to get my skin back to normal with only an occasional need to dab a bit of steroid on an itchy spot that appears. My dermatologist was amazed and happy that I finally found something that will not harm my body in any way but does the job. I use CeraVe face wash  facial moisturizers  and body lotion as well as this cream.

2098,sarah,1,25-Aug-16,One person found this helpful,My dermatologist recommended this product to me  I have acne prone skin. She told me when you have acne you tend to want to use drying products like rubbing alcohol to dry out your skin thinking it will make the zits go away but she says you have to do the opposite and keep your skin moisturized. So I have been after every time I was my face or take a shower. My skin soaks it right up and in combination with a prescribed tretinoin acne cream my acne has really calmed down a lot! I would highly recommend this to anyone struggling with once prone skin or even to someone who has dry skin this stuff soaks right up and leaves your skin feeling fabulous!

2156,S. Bernstein,1,28-Apr-14,8 people found this helpful,I am using this cream in tandem with taking the photoceramide capsules  and it has been an outstanding combination. I think that most of the improvement in my skin has been due to the cream. After trying a few different name brand toning/moisturizing creams for the last few years to help with brown spots and some age-related droop  I have seen a really noticeable improvement using CeraVe in two months  with a lot the improvement coming in the first 30 days. Brown spots are greatly faded  and folds between mouth and nose and tangibly reduced. The evenness of my skin tone is the best it has been in many years. Even the acitinic kerotosis that would pop up are less pronounced and less frequent. However  the really stubborn  ak s  are still there  but less visible.  Besides improving my skin tone  I was also hoping for some help with my neck. Since losing a great deal of weight I have excess skin mostlly in front around my adam s apple. This nagging problem is still there  but in general there is less sagging around the jaw line than before.  I am convinced that there is no  miracle  solution that will make age and sun damage issues disappear  but this cream has produced more  better  and faster results than I ve had with any other product and I highly recommend it.

2454,Amazon Customer,1,12-Sep-16,One person found this helpful,CeraVe moisturizing cream is fairly light and nongreasy. I used Acid Mantle Cream for 20 years until it was discontinued. CeraVe moisturizing cream is a good substitute  although I liked my previous face cream better. I also tried Cetaphil moisturizing cream for dry and sensitive skin. It s heavier than CeraVe  more like acid mantle cream  but too greasy. I won t be buying the Cetaphil moisturizing cream again  but I will continue with CeraVe moisturizing cream--unless I find something better.
2455,Francis Putnam,1,05-Aug-16, ,Good results for an easily applied moisturizer that adsorbs easily  down side is the hyaluronic acid for tightening can be irritating to the tender bits. Otherwise there is a great dry surfaced feeling of deeper moisturizing happening.

This is simply wonderful for dry skin. Now my boyfriend even uses it. I prefer this 16-oz tub with the extra pump you can purchase through Amazon  but there are also CeraVe lotions available  if you prefer those. When the contents get low  the pump cannot reach the product anymore  so I move the pump to a new 16-oz tub. After some of this has been used  I add the remaining contents of the first tub.
2467,Amy Aotaki-Keen,1,03-Aug-13, ,This product is great for anyone suffering from dry skin. The price is reasonable and it works great. It has no scent and dries easily after applying so you don t have sticky sensation after using it.

I have had none of my usual winter cracks on fingers (Thank you). And it feels great on elbows  too.

2519,wheatbix,1,05-Mar-13,3 people found this helpful,I have had very severe eczema since I was a baby  and I have always used Aquaphor/Eucerin to maintain it. I also use steroid creams  etc. My sister uses this cream for her kids  who have mild eczema  and she claims that this cream completely keeps their eczema away without the use of steroids that she used to have to use. I decided to try it out. I like the cream.. as far as my eczema  it s still as bad as it usually is.. but mine is pretty severe. I don t think a simple cream will COMPLETELY fix it. It IS  however  very very moisturized now. I love this because it s not greasy like my aquaphor is  so I can use it at work and not leave grease marks everywhere. It really softens my skin very nicely. So far  I really like it.  The only problem was that it s sooo difficult to find in stores. This is why I ordered it from here. The price was GREAT  I got free 2 day shipping from Prime  so it was a win win situation... but the only thing that bugged me is that when it got here  the product was in a plastic sealed bag  yes  but the product itself didn t have a seal on it. There was no seal under the lid to ensure that the product wasn t tampered with before being shipped. That s my only concern. I have full faith in Amazon  but that just kinda skeeves me out a bit. I don t know if that s just a CeraVe problem or if it s the distributor s problem.

2527,Philsgirl,1,20-Jul-15, ,I first used this product at my sister s house and really liked it. She is a P.A. and worked for a dermatologist and this cream is what she said she used all the time. I also found out my daughter used the CeraVe too and loved it. After using the product for two weeks I m sold! I really like that it s not greasy and doesn t seem to  melt  when I m outside and get a little sweaty. I ve gone through menopause and my skin has gotten noticeably dryer so I really wanted something that gave my skin a nice  fresh look. The CeraVe takes care of that.

2529,kfitz60,1,23-Jun-16, ,This was recommended to me by my Dermatologist. Wonderful cream. I have very dry skin and this works better than any other lotion I have used. There is very little if any aroma  which I like.

2566,Amazon Customer,0,04-Jan-17,23 people found this helpful,I purchased this item because it had many great reviews. I have chronic eczema and this product advertises that is it accepted by the National Eczema Association so I thought it was going to be a great product. It feel good on the skin initially  but after just one application to my hands (the area affected by eczema) they become extremely itchy. I then checked the ingredients and saw that this product has both methylparaben and propylparaben. Parabens are a well none ingredient to avoid for people with skin sensitivities. Warning to other purchases - READ THE LABEL FIRST. I am disappointed that this information wasn t provided up front in the product description and that the National Eczema Association would approve it. Be careful buyers and always double check the ingredients as companies will apparently say anything to get you to buy their product.
2567,Jean Katherine Baldridge,1,24-Jun-17,One person found this helpful,I have very dry skin  and lately it has been so dry that my face has been hurting. I was reading reviews of 10 or so top moisturizers and this one was on the list--possibly #1. I couldn t believe how inexpensive it was and thought I would try it. I ordered it here on Amazon and it arrived quickly. I have been using every day ever since. It is great for your whole body  not just your face  too! This jar is huge!

2582,bzymom,1,30-Mar-13,6 people found this helpful,I liked this enough to post this to my friends and family on facebook: A patient told me a few months ago about a great lotion her dermatologist had recommended  and I finally tried it last night. I am in awe. After literally 20 years of trying different lotions  vaseline with socks on my hands at night  steroid creams and ointments  this is the ONLY thing that has ever made a significant difference on my hands and feet. Literally after one night of use I can tell a dramatic difference with less roughness  peeling  cracking. I have no financial interest in this product  but simply wanted to share the info to anyone who experiences significant dry skin  eczema  cracking hands in the winter  etc. I sound like an infomercial  but this is just an amazing result from one use. FYI I used the CeraVe SA for the roughest areas - has salicylic acid in it that helps with the roughness but some people might be sensitive to that (although I have sensitive skin  and had no issues). Just sharing the love! I m so ready for sandals now!
2583,Sugar Tang,1,04-Nov-15, ,Useful  will buy back. Thanks to the store discount activity.
2584,spb,1,31-Jan-17, ,you can t go wrong with cerave  and the right price.

2586,Cj,1,13-Jul-16, ,So moisturizing!!! I have eczema and this is very helpful. ONE OF THE BEST!
2587,Nathalie,1,14-Jul-13, ,I used this after 7-10 other baby products for my babies skin. This worked better than organic anything made for babies. I use on her body and it is smooth and non irritating! It seems like a lot up front but it comes in a very large container and will last you at least -5 months depending on how much you use.
2588,Julie L Worth,1,26-May-18, ,Best product for my eczema prone skin.

2595,Jayme M. Lafleur,1,16-Jan-11,6 people found this helpful,I ve been suffering from dry skin on my legs for the past few years now  due to what I believe are the chemicals in our city s water. Since I live in an apartment  a soft water system is not an option for me. I too was also a skeptic of this product  since I have tried everything from coconut oil  to Eucerin  Neutragena s dry hands skin formula  even prescription lotions  and while some of these have helped to temporarily relieve the stress my skin is under  NONE of them have come close to this cream s ability to maintain the balance my skin needs. I am simply ammazed how quickly my eczema and dry skin patches went away with this. In fact they are completely gone  and I ve only been using it a week now. I saw improvement with my skin s appearance within two days  and felt improvement within the first 10 minutes of applying it. I actually just sent a link from amazon to my parents who also have dry skin around winter time. My boyfriend also tried it on his severely winter induced craked hands  and he s going to buy some as well. He was so surprised how quickly it worked within the first application. His hands were completely soft. He was so happy it worked  he asked if he could take some home with him! I am sure he will need several applications to repair the damage on his skin. This product is truly wonderful. I will definitely be recommending it to everyone I know that suffers from severe dry skin. I will be purchasing this again. Best moisturizing cream I ve ever found!
2596,Amazon Customer,1,18-Apr-18, ,Love this moisturizer! Hands down the best I’ve ever used!!
2597,genealady,1,12-Jul-15, ,Simply the best!
2598,SkinPro2,1,07-Jul-14,5 people found this helpful,The best solution for crepey skin. Soaks in immediately  and leaves no residue whatsoever. I use it on my face sometimes and that s unheard of for me having sensitive skin. CeraVe is probably one of the best moisturizers on the market that doesn t cost half a paycheck and a visit to a specialty store. If you want your skin smooth as glass  give this a try. You ll give away all of your other lotions after one full day of use.
2599,Chris R.,1,17-Mar-14, ,This cream is great. It moisturizes and creates a barrier to protect skin and trap in moisture. It was recommended for my baby by his Doctor.
2600,J F,1,07-Jun-15, ,We love this for eczema! Great deal  but I recently saw it on sale at Costco for much cheaper and a bigger jar.

2610,M. Black,1,11-Sep-10,3 people found this helpful,This cream was recommended by my dermatologist. I was thrilled to find it at Amazon.com and ordered two jars to avoid the shipping charges. The two jars were shipped separately - not sure why. The first jar arrived in good condition and I started using it immediately. I can see and feel the difference in my skin already - I LOVE this cream. Now to the second jar - it arrived several days later and fortunately the jar was sealed in a plastic wrapper because the lid of the jar was not fastened securely and the cream leaked out during shipment. I was able to return it free of charge (printed a free return UPS label on line)  but am still waiting for a refund. They could not send a replacement as it was not shipped directly from Amazon. So if/when I do get my refund  they ll probably withhold shipping charges on the original order since the one jar I was able to use was less than $25. So  even though I will continue to use this brand of cream  I m pretty sure I won t be ordering it from Amazon again.
2611,Cori Contreras,1,31-Aug-14,One person found this helpful,My 3 year old had eczema. This lotion is the only thing I ve been able to find that actually works to keep her skin soft and normal looking. It absorbs quickly but is also nice and creamy.

The seller shipped it out immediately and we received it very quickly. I would definitely order from this seller again.

2616,missssay,1,20-Apr-16,One person found this helpful,I use Retinol for acne and it dries my skin out so bad that my skin literally peels off in some area. I apply this about 4 hours after the Retinol before bed and it had been amazing! Highly recommend for anyone that suffers from dry skin or is having the same side effects of Retinol. It is super thick so you seriosuly only need a tiny dab to apply to your face. Buy it here on Amazon too  it is such a better deal!

They don t get clean. My nose usually feels like sand paper. I even went to the dermatologist and tried trentonin. It worked okay  but not well enough.  I ve had this cream for 3 days. I ve applied it every morning and night. My nose is now soft as a baby s bottom. It doesn t feel like sand paper anymore. It seems to have eaten the blackheads. 5 starz

2700,Anne Ross,1,26-Mar-14, ,This cream was recommended by my dermatologist. I had heard of it but had not tried it  and I am happy to say I am very pleased with it. I would definitely purchase it again. It is moisturizing and absorbs well without leaving any residue.
2701,ejp,1,20-Oct-15, ,A friend recommended years ago and I started using it. Truly excellent value and one of the best creams on the market.
2702,LAWRENCE,1,08-Oct-08,8 people found this helpful,I am 45 years old and have had exycema and dry skin all my life. I have tried several over the counter lotions and creams over the years. This is by far the best cream I have found and I am never going back to any of the others. I am very satisfied with the results and you can t even tell that I have dry skin or exycema anymore since I have been using it.
2703,Amazonian,1,07-Oct-15, ,I waited to write this review as I wanted to see if the moisturizer would make a change or difference in my skin. So far so good. I don t see my scars vanishing like in some other reviews but this cream is very  very moisturizing and not greasy at all. It absorbs into my skin quickly and keeps it soft throughout the day or night. Great for under make up application as it absorbs so well and stays matte. I do recommend.
2704,A.B.,1,26-Nov-11,4 people found this helpful,This lotion is very thick  but you can rub it in all the way. You could use a ton of it if you want. It moisturizes well  has no scent  and I had no adverse reactions to it. It s a great lotion if you want a lot of lotion to soak into your skin.

I rarely have to use the OTC cortizone medicine now. Skin patches look better in one day  and this stuff seems to keep the eczema patches away  too.

2753,tom sniegocki,1,19-Jan-17, ,Great moisturising cream
2754,P. Bagocius,1,23-Feb-13, ,My dermatologist recommended this OTC cream for my excessive dry shin  knee  and elbow areas. I started to see results in a week with once daily application. The dermatologist said the cream works on the surface of the skin as well as the layer beneath. It quickly absorbs into the skin and only leaves a creamy feel on the surface for a short while (10-15 minutes). A little pricey  but if you want to end dry skin  this is the cream for you.
2755,The Judge,1,22-Mar-15, ,This is excellent for dry and cracked skin that is so common during the winter season.
2756,johnny yang,1,16-Mar-14, ,Fast shipping and good. A whole lot  it will probably last couple of months. which is good. I like the product. Feels a bit sticky but after awhile it doesn t feel that much anymore.

2786,Jason Kwong,1,02-Jan-14,6 people found this helpful,My wife and I both had eczema as children so it was no surprise that our daughter had it too. When my girl was 3 years old  she had bad rashes on her face and hands  especially during Fall/Winter. Her prescribed hydrocortisone ointment was no longer working. Her skin would bleed from the scratching. It was very stressful and we were at our wit s end. Fortunately  one of her teachers (who had also battled eczema) recommended CeraVe. Wow  what a difference it made. My daughter s skin completely cleared up within a week or two. In fact  after the rashes subsided  her skin peeled like she was healing from a sunburn. Clear  smooth skin showed through afterwards. We ve used it on her ever since and her rashes have never returned.  Moreover  I recently had a mild recurrence of my childhood eczema. I foolishly suffered with it for a few days until my wife pointed out the CeraVe (so obvious now). I slathered some on before bed and  wouldn t you know it  my skin was noticeably better by morning. A few days later now and my eczema is just about gone. So  needless to say  this has worked wonders for our family s eczema. Your mileage may vary but it certainly does work on some types of eczema.
2787,Sonali gupta,1,22-Nov-15, ,Works great with my patients who have dry skin
2788,Evan S.,1,31-Jul-13,2 people found this helpful,This moisturizing cream is AMAZING. It is gentle enough for me to apply near/around my eyes  where I have eczema. This is the first lotion I have found that is gentle enough for this!  Also  when I use this cream  it feels heavy at first-but then sucks into my skin in only a minute or two. It leaves me feeling smooth and hydrated  without ever feeling oily or greasy. I apply it every night before bed and it has never made me break out like some moisturizers do. When I wake up in the morning my skin STILL feels moisturized!

2805,S. Payne,1,13-Dec-13, ,For a cream  rather than a lotion  it goes on very smoothly and soaks in immediately. Definitely relieves very dry skin in a matter of days. Only downside? I only wish they could make this in a mildly scented variety. Unscented is a tad boring.

2813,Karen W,1,04-Feb-13,One person found this helpful,This product is great for anyone who gets dry winter skin. I was worried that it might be too thick  too heavy or too greasy for a facial product but it absolutely is not. It absorbs quickly  within a minute or two  so it initially does feel like there is a residue on my face  but after a minute  nothing but smooth skin ready for makeup. There is no fragarance and it is great for sensitive skin - I ve had products cause a rash or irritation before but nothing but smooth sailing with CeraVe. Great product and I will continue using this. My skin felt softer within two days of my initial use.

2818,Amazon Customer,0,20-Feb-17, ,I usually do not write review for anything. but i am writing for this so you can imagine that i have something to say. the Jar was left in a big box with a other product i ordered. not a big deal since it was a plastic jar. but the jar had no seal. it looked like the jar was refilled with cream. When i usually order this cream from other stores  they have plastic seal under the lead to keep the ingredient fresh. I do not want to put something on my face is not in original package  because i have sensitive skin and breaks out easily. I have used the product for only one day now. I will update the review as i see any difference.

CeraVe moisturizes very well  without feeling greasy. While I don t use the cream on my face  it works well everywhere else. My dermatologist recommended the cream for my back and chest  and it works amazingly well. The cream is a much heavier product than the lotion  which I also like.

My toddler son had eczema and my wife really did not want to use steroid creams on him because of their side effects. We struggled with various other creams but to no avail. When we started using cerave  his eczema pretty much cleared up. We still struggle with it  and cerave is not a miracle cure  but it certainly seems to help. It s pretty expensive  but I think it is worth a try for anyone who struggles with dry skin.

2840,Peter,1,29-Dec-12,2 people found this helpful,My daughter has severe eczema on the foot  ankle  back of palm  wrist and elbow. The affected areas are usually angry red with breakouts. Most creams I tried did not work. Cerave cream is the latest one I tried on her that works. It calms the skin and keeps it moisturized.  The good points: - Keeps the skin moisturized for long period. - Affordable price point. A lot of creams at smaller packaging are a lot more expensive. - Does not seem to encourage secondary bacteria infections.  The cons: - Contains preservatives like parabans. This issue is a double edge sword. Creams without preservatives may not be suitable for eczema sufferers. My daughter tend to scratch the itch till the skin breaks. Creams without preservatives seems to encourage bacteria growth. You will probably need to apply anti bacteria cream on top of creams without preservatives.  She went through a couple of courses of antibiotics to suppress the infections beneath the skin after using plant base creams that does not have preservatives.  - Pretty thick cream that makes it difficult to spread around.  If you are an eczema sufferer without any good alternatives  I would recommend try this after weighing in the issue of parabans. My view is that there is probably nothing to worry about. Most creams out there in the market uses some form of preservatives. There is very little chance to duck this.

I use it primarily for dry areas but its like heaven on freshly shaven legs. Its also fragrance free which I love.
2852,ck,1,11-Dec-12, ,This product is great for eczema. Goes on creamy  but the cream is absorbed quickly. Lasts longer than the regular skin lotions.

My skin just drank it up  but I kept using it and now the itching has stopped completely and I feel younger with moisturized skin.  I also started putting either oatmeal bath stuff or epson salts in the bath water and that helped a lot.

2885,DAWN,0,27-May-18, ,Firstly  this comes with absolutely no seal which is sketchy and unsanitary. Secondly  it doesn’t moisturize at all. In fact  it made my glowy skin looks matte and stiff.  Not being able to return it is just an added bonus ??
2886,Michelle,0,09-Jun-15,4 people found this helpful,Greasy. Greasy greasy greasy. I put this on at night and have to wait about 25 minutes before I can lay down or else my sheets and dog/cat hair stick to my face. In the morning  I have to wait about 30-35 minutes before I can put on my makeup. This is what really frsutrates me. If I don t wait long enough  my makeup foundation reacts poorly with the lotion and starts to coagulate. It looks like little patches of foundation on my face and I end up having to re-wash and re-apply my makeup. I wouldn t recommend this lotion. HOWEVER. Their face-wash is PHENOMENAL! Absolutely love that. Lotion - not so much

2904,xxxxxxxx,0,07-Nov-18,2 people found this helpful,I have used CeraVe moisturizing cream for quite some time and really like it. However  the last jar I ordered had an unpleasant  lingering odor  so I requested a replacement jar with Amazon. They were very helpful; gave me a credit for the original jar (and had me return it)  and sent a replacement jar right away. Bad news: The second  replacement jar of this cream has the exact same unpleasant  lingering odor. Very annoying. I am keeping the replacement jar and using the cream  but am not happy about it. Even though I ve used  and liked  this product for quite some time  it is very  very doubtful I will buy it again when this jar is gone. Who wants to smell  bad ? The manufacturer needs to figure out where their  recipe  has gone wrong and fix it if they want people to keep buying it.

2910,bargainmama,0,04-Aug-16, ,I have been using a cetaphil facial moisturizer. At my dermatologist s recommendation  I started using Cerave AM and PM facial moisturizers and they have been fantastic! Super impressed. I have used Cetaphil moisturizing cream and have loved it. I figured I should try Cerave since I liked their face stuff so much. That was a bad mistake. I honestly can t believe I wasted my money on this stuff. My skin was getting more and more dry so I figured I was not using enough of it. Nope. It makes it even drier than if I used nothing at all. If I could  I would give this one star. I guess it didn t irritate my sensitive skin so it has that going for it.

After searching online and reading reviews  I decided to go to Walgreens and pick this up. It is kinda pricy for a drugstore cream but completly worth it! I applied it the first night and noticed a huge difference the next morning! After a week  my skin has seen a 100% improvement! No flaking  peeling  burning at all. I have only been applying it at night time  and so it seems that this will last me a couple of months at least  so I m very comfortable with the price. Give it a try! I love it  and you may too!

It has this silky texture that absorbs right away and leaves my hands feeling so soft and takes care of the dry patches on my face imediately. Such a wonderful purchase and I couldn t be happier! Also  the tub is quite large and a little goes a long way  so I don t think I ll be needing anymore any time soon. I recommend it!

2939,PandasPancake,0,29-Oct-12,2 people found this helpful,I use Proactive for acne treatment. And my skin tends to become very dry afterwards  especially at my nose. The cerave cream moisturises other face regions well  but it does not moisturize my nose region well or long enough. I tried to put a lot on my nose region  but the cream was too thick to get absorbed  leaving unabsorbed white stretches on my nose. I strongly wish that the cream can be less thick and more absorbing.

2954,chinina,0,24-Sep-15,2 people found this helpful,I have been using Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream (tub) for my baby and myself and have had no problems. I saw the high reviews for CeraVe and was wondering if I was missing out on something so I ordered this to try and compare. Now I m trying to use it up quickly so I can go back to Cetaphil and here s why: a. CeraVe has the same exact look and consistency of Elmer s Glue. For a cream  it s pretty liquid and gooey. You put it on and your skin is a bit sticky/tacky for awhile before it absorbs/dries. I was almost expecting it to dry and be able to peel off a  skin . Cetaphil feels like a true rich cream and goes on skin feels dewy and soft after. b. No noticeable difference from drugstore brand lotions. Definitely not as moisturizing as Cetaphil Cream. Cetaphil makes your skin so soft and it s a noticeable difference even after one use.

2968,Daniel O.,0,24-Nov-12,6 people found this helpful,I picked this up when my local drugstore was sold out of the usual Cerave lotion (the one in the pump bottle)  thinking it would be a suitable replacement.  This is essentially the same product  but thicker and richer. It doesn t seem to absorb quite as well as the lotion at first  and leaves you feeling pretty greasy. On the other hand  it does seem more powerful and restorative.  My biggest gripe is the packaging. Why is this just sitting in a big bucket and not in a pump? You have to stick your fingers into it  contaminating the bulk with each use. Ick.

The two jars were put into seperate plastic bage. (thank goodness) but then put into a box  much larger than necessary  that allowed them to roll around. By the time They arrived  one of the tops on one of the jars came off and about 1/3 of the product was lost inside the plastic bag. What a mess.
2984,Marilyn C Peterson,1,28-Mar-11,10 people found this helpful,I originally saw this product in a video on MSN. It was recommended by a Make-Up BF. I wrote it down and ordered on line here on Amazon and received it in a few days. The first time I put it on I was surprised at the thickness and creaminess of the product. Within a week I noticed my skin seemed less dry. My father mentioned that my skin looked younger and less flaky. I have used it now for 2 months and I won t use anything else. My father has started using it also. He is 79 years old and now swears by it. There is always a jar on the bathroom sink for easy access. I ve received compliments from the people at my gym about how young my face is looking lately and I found out that two or three of them have also started using Cerave. They love it also. I highly recommend this moisturizing cream. It lasts for awhile and you don t need to use alot of it. It is reasonably priced at $13.99 a 16 oz jar and at this price it can t hurt to try it.
2985,mjyum1,1,09-Aug-09,22 people found this helpful,My son has bad eczema and we ve been through tons of different creams including prescription creams recommended by his pediatrician. We went to a pediatric dermatologist and she recommend cerave. Right away  we noticed a big difference in our son s skin. Usually  I would slather on aquaphor/eucerin  etc.  and less than an hour later  his skin was back to feeling like sand paper. With the cerave  his skin stays hydrated  moist  soft  and supple all day without feeling greasy. I recommended this to a friend of mine whose daughter also suffers from eczema and she loves it  too. I recommended this to my mom who suffers from severe dry skin and uses creams that cost over $100 that she has to reapply throughout the day to keep her face hydrated. She used it one day and she noticed a big difference right away. She said her face stayed hydrated all day and she felt no need to reapply. Even my husband who has suffered from eczema all his life and thought he knew everything about how to take care of his eczema and what creams were best was impressed. And now he tells everyone about this cream  too. If you suffer from dry skin  look no further. This is the cream for you. It is absolutely the best thing out there.

About 1/4 of the cream came out into the bag. Instead of returning  I captured as much as possible and put the cream back into the jar. I got most back in but now 100% of course. It was a big mess and could have been prevented by leaving with a tightened lid.  This is my 3rd jar from Amazon and all the others arrived fine. I love the product and was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I will order again.

While getting out of a pool holding onto the rail or climbing out  my legs and hands had me slip right back into the pool. I see that the substance obviously retains moisture but I wouldn t think this stuff would work as a  water-proof  type of cream. Other then that  it s sensitive to eczema skin and does leave it supple and soft.

I had to forfeit it at the airport so I came online to buy another. I d heard good things about the CeraVe (in the tub) and ordered it. It turns out it s much thicker than its bottle cousin  which I didn t really foresee  and I think it led to more breakouts.
2998,Amazon Customer,1,01-Sep-13,331 people found this helpful,I have suffered for the past 3 years with sores all over my body from not being able to stop picking at them when they become irritating. It left me with unsightly scars and scabs. People thought I had chicken pox or chewed alive by mosquitos. I also suffer from repeated cellulitis infections on my face from rosacea that is very sensitive and I spend more months out of the year on antibiotics than I don t. I ve been using CeraVe cream for about 1 month now  everyday  and have had the most incredible results. All the scabs have healed up. I still have scars but there is a noticeable reduction in visibility of them. I still get mild crawling sensations that I find myself reaching to scratch at  but because I no longer encounter a rough spot  I no longer scratch open my skin leading to more scabs and scars  so the cycle of scratch-itch-scratch seems to be broken. My skin is silky smooth  and I can shave my legs with a razor again instead of using Nair hair remover. And I haven t used a razor in 3 years - to me that is amazing  lol.  If there ever was a product I stood behind 100% it would be CeraVe. I also purchased some organic tea tree oil soap to use on my face and body and I started using that about 2 months ago. I did notice a small amount of improvement on my face and skin from that product. But it wasn t until I started applying CeraVe that I had a significant change. My face is the most changed. All my blemishes are gone  My skin is soft and radiant looking again. I was diagnosed with rosacea in 2009 and before that had maybe 1 pimple every time I got my period. I was always praised for my  peaches and cream  complexion  so it was really devastating to deal with severe rosacea -peeling skin like I always had a sunburn  blemishes  sores  and worst of all the hidden pockets of infection that would develop into painful lumps (cellulitis) that I would need to be on antibiotics for. It got so that all I had to do was call in to the doctor s office to have them call in a prescription for antibiotics - I no longer needed an appointment to get it because they were so familiar with my case. I am literally crying as I write this review as I have never been more grateful for something than I am for CeraVe. I have since purchased their face moisturizer with sunscreen from Walmart and it works well but I don t think it would have healed me initially like the cream did. The cream is what really worked for me though and I use it nightly. The biggest fear I had about this product was that it would cause my rosacea to worsen because it was a cream  but I gave it a shot because it said it was non-comodongetic which means it doesn t cause pimples  and it doesn t!  One problem I had that wasn t really an issue for me was Keratosis (prickly  bumpy skin) on my upper arms - it was mild - but that is all but gone as well from use of the cream. At this time  I am going through about 1 tub of the cream in 5 weeks  but I am also overweight so I have more area to cover so others can expect to use less of the product. It is worth every single penny. It s worked so well  my sister bought it just because of my success and she doesn t have any skin issues and can get by using the cheaper lotions from the local stores but she likes how soft my skin is. Please  if you have any kind of skin issues such as I had  do not hesitate to order this product. Use it everyday and I will guarantee that you will see results.  There is only one  very small  insignificant issue that annoys me. If I put it on on a hot day  or before I exercise  it makes my skin slick (not greasy  just slick). I found that  even with sweat  I would just rub the lotion back in and it was fine.
2999,Mo,0,15-Dec-14,4 people found this helpful,I purchased this some time ago  tried it and didn t like it because it dried out my face. I went back to it after a long period in between to give it another chance  and it left me with the same results it previously did. The employee and/or CEO must ve written the countless positive reviews of this product. This as a  moisturizer  doesn t actually moisturize. It does the opposite. It makes the skin dry. And it leaves a chalky residue on the face. To top it off  I hear this has cancer-causing parabens. This was supposedly  developed   by dermatologists. Yea  right. And I m a billionaire. Back to Cetaphil. Thumb this down CeraVe CEO/employees  your product is garbage.

3005,hdean360,0,04-Aug-16, ,I purchased this item becuase it is highly effective lotion on dry skin. Since I have purchased this produce in other places  and know it costs between $12 and $20  a price tag of $65 would seem to indicate to me that I d receive several containers. WRONG! You get ONE 19 oz container of lotion. One container of lotion for $65! UNBELIEVABLE!. It s going back. Completely disappointed.

3007,Nicole Apple,1,31-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,I ve been using this for about a month as a morning moisturizer for my face and finally feel like it an earned an honest review. I d been through so many expensive moisturizers to finally luck out and try this one on a whim.  I use an old recycled L U S H sample container to hold small  bathroom counter friendly amounts of this Cervave moisturizer (and avoid unnecessarily contaminating the giant original tub of Cerave product). In the morning I wash my face  spray my L U S H Tea Tree toner  and apply a dab of this moisturizer in my hand  alongside an even smaller amount of my T A R T E clay BB cream. I MIX THESE TWO TOGETHER in my hands and apply to my face and neck. What do I get from this combo of moisturizer/BB cream? An extremely natural  dewy looking complexion that lasts all day. I will also do this same mixture with my L oreal BB cream because it has a terrible orange tint to it. Adding the moisturizer to the BB cream somehow completely eliminates the orange hue AND it makes whatever BB or CC cream foundation I m using last twice as long! Hey  if you don t know  now ya know...:)  OTHER USES: I also use this lotion for applying self-tanner. I m at a point where I am serious about protecting my skin/staying out of the direct sunlight and away from artificial tanning beds. I buy a Facial Tanning spray from Amazon and mix it with this lotion to lighten the fade of the self-tanner and make application process easier. I put little dabs of lotion (probably quarter sized) in my hand  and directly spray the lotion in my hands  mix it together  and apply to my face. I then take a towel and roughly wipe out the crevices of my fingers so they don t stain. I do this again and again until full body coverage.  I have never had a skin issue with this product. This is coming from someone extremely pale (nearly transparent)  with pink undertones  who breaks out using Sensitive Skin lotion geared towards newborn babies. Trust me...I doubted this lotion too since it wasn t from some  fancy  costly cosmetic brand  and I d never heard any make-up artists recommend it. I can t believe I overlooked this lotion. I m sorry I slept on you CeraVe!!!

3011,AJ,0,21-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,I bought this stuff purely based on the excellent reviews it has on here. I put this stuff on my face and it is SO disgustingly sticky. Like  it feels like I sweat all over my face and then it dried up. The title of this product on Amazon is misleading because I can tell this cream is NOT meant to be put on your face. Cerave was sneaky in that they didn t put  face  OR  body  on the label. It just says moisturizing cream. It does not absorb well into the skin which is sometimes acceptable as a body moisturizer?but def not face. I bought this stuff solely to try as a face moisturizer. I wrote this review because I don t want anyone else to be fooled by the fabulous Amazon ratings. But by all means  try this if you want a body moisturizer.  I got this stuff from Walmart so it is a 100% authentic Cerave product.
3012,Cortney L. Rose,1,10-Jan-19, ,I have used CeraVe s face washes for a couple years now and I love them. A couple weeks ago  I started to get dry flaky skin around my nose. Probably from a combination of blowing my nose 800 times a day from being sick and not using any moisturizer. A week ago  I ran out of my face wash so when I was at the store  I grabbed a new bottle but also noticed this moisturizing cream and Walgreens was having a BOGO 50% off sale so I grabbed the cream too. I started using it that night and also every morning after I wash my face. It s been a week now and HOLY COW!! My skin is so soft! All dryness is gone. And not a single breakout. Also  maybe I m seeing things  but the wrinkles under my eyes seem less harsh. I m impressed and it takes a lot to impress me when it comes to beauty products. I m somewhat of a makeup and skincare junkie. I ve spent $100s on anti-wrinkle and moisturizing creams that promise results. Who knew that a $15 tub of this stuff would work so much better?? At this price  I can put it on my dry hands and elbows as well. If you re looking for something to calm and moisturize your skin  THIS IS THE BEST.

I opened  checked  smelled  and eyed every single brand on the shelf like a snob before settling on CeraVe. It s thick and gooey like what I normally use. And at almost 50 years old ... this is what my face needs to stay hydrated throughout the day. I am in love with this lotion. I ve only been using it a few days and my fine lines are gone! Gone! I also love the price point  the huge tub  and it s fragrance free. I ll buy this going forward. Trifecta win!
3014,soo,0,25-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,im sorry to give one star but it just wasnt for me. there was no seal like other reviews said so that wasn t a surprise. However  the 2nd day i used this product  my skin started to breaking out. it started with small spotted redness and irritated skin and by the 3rd day  they turned into pimples and kept getting worse. my whole face got really itchy that i rather have dry skin instead of applying this product... I do have sensitive and dry skin. but usually don t have any skin trouble; haven t had this crazy amount of pimples for ever! and that itchiness just made it worse. Also  i didn t like how it just  sits  on top of my skin layer  rather than  getting absorbed  into the skin.. if i apply this at night before the bed and wash my face in the next morning  its so soapy and have to wash more to get rid of that soapy feeling. it may work just fine for others but for me  it ruined my skin  and was waste of money.
3015,edp285,1,17-Apr-12,131 people found this helpful,There are already many good reviews  but few have mentioned using Cerave as treatment for chronic dandruff/scalp eczema. I also thought it would be helpful to provide a detailed account of how I use it.  Here s my story: I m a 27 year old male who s had eczema since I can remember. There have been periods where it s been relatively mild and periods where it s been extreme - extreme enough to not want to go out in public. As I ve gotten older it s tended on the extreme  especially during the dry  winter months. Specifically  I get bad facial eczema (very bad on the eyelids)  as well as eczema behind the knees and elbows  neck  scalp  chest  back  etc. I ve tried a lot of moisturizers  steroids (both oral and topical)  elidel and protopic  dandruff shampoos  and a variety of other things. All of the moisturizers irritated my skin. Steroids worked but they re not a long-term solution (because of the side-effects; plus  after regular use I could tell I was building a tolerance). The only useful dandruff shampoo was Nizoral - but that was more of a temporary fix  and it left my hair super dry and brittle.  After all of the experimentation I found a routine that keeps my skin about 95% clear  and most of it is due to Cerave. The only exception is my eyelids - I apply protopic daily  and then Cerave over top of it. This keeps them about 99% clear. I ve tried going without the protopic but my eyelids get pretty bad without it still; fortunately  protopic does not weaken with use  nor have the known long-term side effects - like skin-thinning - that steroids have.  A little bit on the specifics. When I began using it  it actually caused a slight burning sensation  and my skin would turn pretty red. This lasted for about 1-2 weeks but gradually went completely away. My own guess is that my skin was re-establishing a proper barrier. I mention this because  if you ve had problems initially  I would give it at least 3 weeks before dropping it - it may just be your skin getting acclimated to it. As for application  I put it on my face  neck  backs of knees and elbows  and anywhere else that s dried out or suffering from eczema - I try to do it about twice a day (and I apply liberally). I should also mention that there was a brief period where I would get an infrequent but deep pimple on my face - the kind I almost never got before. But after a while this symptom also went away.  Lastly  as mentioned above  I ve also had scalp eczema (or dandruff). Before Cerave  Nizoral had been the only partial fix - but not a very good one. Anyways  as far as application  my hair is not styled long  but it s also not a buzz cut  so it s not as convenient or easy as putting it on your skin. My hair gets sort of drenched in Cerave. As a result  I do it once a day  at night a bit before I go to bed. With hair being in the way  you have to make sure to get it all the way down in to your scalp (apply liberally)  otherwise it won t work properly. In the morning I wash it out with Kirk s Coco Castile Bar Soap (the soap I use for everything). After putting it on for just a few days  the itchiness and dryness on my scalp has resolved 99%. My dandruff is now gone and I no longer have to use Nizoral.  Overall  I m very impressed with Cerave. It s the only thing that provides relief without irritating my skin. It s been a genuine life-changer.
3016,sb-lynn,1,26-May-18, ,I was only to happy to review this CeraVe Moisterizing Cream. Normally when I am given creams or lotions to review  I like to try them out over a period of time to make sure they don’t cause any problems . I didn’t have to wait when I received this one because I’ve been using this for such a long time and it’s been great.  I have sensitive skin and have to be careful what kinds of soaps and lotions I use. In past  I have used Eucerin and Cetaphil lotions because they are good for those of us who have any skin allergies and/or issues. I was happy with those until I tried the CeraVe.  This CeraVe is just the perfect texture; not too runny but more on the thick side. I can use as much as I want and cause no irritation at all and my skin just absorbs it so well.  I found out about the CeraVe from the doctor at UCLA who recommended it as having the best lotions and cleanser for those of us who have skin issues.  Highly recommended. I also love (and use) their CeraVe soap bars and I never thought I’d be using a bar of soap again  but it’s the best.
3017,California Dreamer,1,28-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I really like this cream & it is the ONLY cream that I will apply to my face as well as my body. Usually  when a product states it can be used on the body & face I am reluctant  but not with this one. I add Rosehip oil to this moisturizer & apply when I am still wet  straight out of the shower on the body. I use on my face after my serums  etc.  keeps everything hydrated & smooth. Every product Cereve offers is excellent no doubt about it!
3018,Professor H,1,09-Nov-17, ,This review is for the CeraVe Moisturizing Cream 16 oz Daily Face and Body Moisturizer for Dry Skin  I use tons of different hand lotions  and know the best ones out there.  I do not like a bunch of fragrance  as I don t think it is helpful to your skin  and there is always a chance of irritation.  I like cetaphil more and more these days. Another good one  but a little harder to come by is Keils creme de corps  also very pricey.  Burts bees has been good  but the smell turns kind of funky after opening the tube.  This Cerave cream is super duper. It really absorbes fast. If you use to much what does not absorb will sit there on your skin making you unhappy so be aware of how much you need.  You can tell there is something on your skin protecting it  but it is never greasy like most creams I have tried. This ones a keeper and it does not have a medicine smell at all. Nice
3019,Amazon Customer,1,08-Nov-18,One person found this helpful,This stuff WORKS people. I had a random eczema breakout over my entire chin/mouth area  accompanied by some fantastic little acne bumps  etc... I tried facials  oils  expensive creams from my esthetician and NOTHING worked. SO embarassing  because I could tell everyone would look at my chin while I talked  especially because I have been known for having very nice skin most of the time.  3 days after using this cream in place of my usual moisturizer and my eczema is completely gone. I have very sensitive skin  so I am ALWAYS wary of using any new products. But I can say without a doubt that this cream SAVED my face. Embarrassment gone. Hallelujah.
3020,Jennifermontoya,0,21-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,I bought this to use on my face based off a positive YouTube recommendation. It didn’t agree well with my skin  and every day that I used it I noticed more and more tiny pimples surfacing all over my cheek  forehead  and chin. The day I saw a large cystic pimple  was the day I decided to stop  and go back to my original moisturizer that never breaks me out with acne. I also noticed that although it moisturized fine  it left the texture of my face worse  and it was like I had an uncomfortable top greasy film or layer on top. I wanted to love this cream  but it was not for me. I guess I’m okay with that because the other reason I don’t like this cream is because it really doesn’t have the cleanest ingredients in it anyway  and I’m looking to stick with clean green natural topicals for the long run. I might start looking into Ceramedx which is a more natural ceramide lotion option  with cleaner ingredients... so back to the drawing board! Happy it has worked for other people that really need it though.
3021,Just-a-mom,1,02-Jan-18, ,I have used Cerave PM moisturizer  but I decided to get this one for my face this time since it s so much bigger. Obviously you can use this pretty much anywhere  but since Cerave is so gentle it does work perfectly on my very sensitive skin. This is in a jar form  thicker than thin  good consistency. My skin looks way better just after a few uses (before I was just using aloe vera gel or a moisturizer from another popular drugstore skincare brand starting with an O). I love that this is not greasy  oily etc and absorbs into the skin completely. My skin will still feel moisturized and plump after it sinks in too  whereeas other formulas by other brands leave my skin feeling dry. I definitely think this will be a new favorite. It s a great value  great ingredients and does exactly what I need. It also wears fantastically under makeup  including foundation.
3022,Kayce Cawthon McCarty,1,03-Nov-17, ,I wanted to try this for my husband  who has dry  thin skin due to medicine.  We used it on one of his arms and on the other  a prescription cream. After fifteen minutes  there was quite a difference between the two. After an hour  there was a huge difference. The CeraVe was doing substantially better than the other cream.  His skin was softer and far less dry. The prescription cream had all absorbed and skin was already feeling a bit dry again. Not what we wanted.  After several hours  the skin with the CeraVe was still soft and supple. We put it in his other arm and the difference was very noticeable.  My husband also really likes that it has no real scent to it - a big plus! No flowery or medicinal smell!  We will continue using it and will show it to his dermatologist. Think it will win the doctor over!  Highly recommend this product!!

I kept looking around and came across cerave on amazon so I just decided that I couldn’t wait two days and had to go to the store and buy it. AND OMG DOES THIS WORK. One time use after I washed my face and my skin looks AMAZING. It looks like it’s never been dry before. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
3024,Kort,1,06-Nov-17, ,This is one of the best products if you need more than just basic skin care. The CeraVe Moisurizing Cream is excellent for addressing persistent skin problems. My mother-in-law used this product on my elderly father-in-law s legs per a nurse s recommendation. It was the only remedy that helped prevent and heal skin breakage due to lack of circulation. I tried it as I get irritated skin when stressed  or if I eat too much sugar  and it feels soothing when applied. The texture of the cream is light and rich and does not feel oily. The second ingredient is glycerin  which helps retain water in the skin. The unscented cream can be used anytime without worry about stains  lingering side effects or odor.  This is a great all-purpose moisturizer for all kinds of skin issues and needs. To quote an often overused phrase  It just works .  ~ Kort
3025,Camille De Armas,1,31-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,I bought this for my husband at first  he has a dry skin and is always irritated if he doesn’t put cream. He was using my cream Av?ne and loved it  but then when he finished it  I was looking for something cheaper that would be as good as Av?ne. Well  it’s even better!! I use it too and my skin has never been that perfect. It looks so moisturized and has a wonderful pulpy effect that makes you look flawless ! Love it
3026,CoCo s Mom,1,18-May-18, ,When you have diabetes  one of the issues you get along with diabetes  is dry skin. Very dry skin. This helps with my face  arms and legs. I especially put it on the driest skin. I find that CeraVe is one of the best moisturizers available. I have used it since I was diagnosed with diabetes. I have tried to stop the dryness and this is compounded by eczema and psoriasis. So  I have to throw some medications in the mixture. I try to not use the medication ointments and creams  because  frankly  they are not good to use without some side effects. I don t get side effects from this company. I use this on my face day and night and I use other items in their line for my arms  hands and legs.
3027,Helping2FindaWay,1,08-Feb-16, ,Finally I have found a cream that is worth every penny of what it costs. Both myself and my one year old son have dry/sensitive/eczema skin. It is very hard finding a cream that will actually moisturize without causing a rash or irritation. Other leading brands that claim to seal in moisture didn t do anything except dry our skin out worse  so when I saw this one I was hesitant to even try it. The first night I put it on my son he had a rash and I was worried this cream would irritate his skin or burn  so I tried it on my face where it was severely irritated and peeling and this did not burn. It actually felt nice  so I put it all over my son  head to toe. His skin was smooth and soft without needing to put more on in the morning. Then I noticed that the peeling and redness on my face was going down after my first use of this cream  so I started using it every morning and night-my irritation went away & so did the peeling within a couple of days without stinging or burning. In fact  the cream felt nice like my dry skin was finally being moisturized instead of having something just sit on it causing more dryness. After trying so many different creams with high hopes  only to have them sting  burn or cause more irritation I am very happy to say that this cream right here is the only one that actually works for me and my son. I will be buying this cream again and stocking up when I get a chance to.
3028,Misha Jones,0,14-Nov-18, ,I have purchased a tub of this every year for abut 4 or 5 years now  to help during the winter with it s horrid lack of humidity. It was the one thing that actually healed the skin on my hands that get so bad right about now. This year I was overjoyed to see they d added a pump to the package. Cool. Well  not really  because they ve changed the formula for sure  maybe when they added the pump because it s no longer effective at all. My skin remains the same sandpaper it was a month ago. $14 down the drain. Thanks  Cerave. You ve lost at least one faithful customer here.
3029,Mrs. Lac,1,09-Nov-17, ,This is the best moisturizing cream I have ever used. It is actually an awesome price for such a big tub too. It s literally going to last sooo long with even daily use. A little goes a long way. I m actually trying this because my dermatologist recommended it. I don t have enough great things to say about it. My skin isn t dry  it isn t greasy  it doesn t feel like I have a heavy lotion on it. I use it on my elbows too. My husband started using it also for red/dry patches he gets on his cheeks. It helps him a lot as well. I have sensitive skin  and this is great for it. No fragrance  hypoallergenic. I only apply this in the morning  it does last a full day leaving my skin feeling great. So happy to finally have this cream!!

3031,Heather LaRee,1,31-May-18, ,I d like to put my whole self into this (very large) tub of moisturizing cream by CeraVe. Super thick  unscented (yay!)  and works into my (dry  itch-prone  variety of issues) skin...face  hands  and arms so far. Initially  I thought it might not soak in (a little dab will do ya)  but it did--with my more than  little dab . Within minutes  I could feel my skin calm which made me relax and smile.. I feel like I ve applied a moisturizing barrier on the outside and a deep healing moisturizer under the barrier. Wow... This will most definitely be a repeat purchase. My skin loves CeraVe products. What a great and valuable company!
3032,Mindy,1,08-Jun-18, ,I really like this moisturizer! It s leaves my skin feeling so silky soft and I absolutely love that it is unscented. (I hate heavy perfume in products; not only is it bad for you but it literally gives me headaches) At first blush it might seem like it s more expensive than other moisturizers but you get A LOT of product for the price... this jar is 19 oz and it s huge! This will last me a long time! I used to use Lubriderm but this is leaps and bounds better! It s my go-to moisturizer now!  The only downside  and I know a few people are sensitive to them  is that it does contain parabens. But otherwise  it s a great product!
3033,hannah,1,16-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,I don t think I understood what facial moisture was until I tried this. I have very dry  red  eczema prone skin that with the likes of other moisturizers literally flakes off or becomes an oil slick and refuses to absorb. I also am prone to hormonal acne AND acne that develops under my eczema patches (lucky  right?)  I am not joking when I say my skin drinks this. You put it on and you think   oh god it s so thick is it going to absorb?  Then I walk around my kitchen for a minute and touch my face and it s gone. It feels like your skin is just naturally that plump and smooth.  Also found out in a particularly bad eczema flare up that yes  you can wear it in the daytime and it serves as a fantastic primer. I think this is what our dermatologists were talking about when they say  when your face isn t hydrated it overproduces oil  because since I ve been using it morning and night for two weeks now I haven t had 1) an oil slick of makeup at the end of the day 2) a flaky mess or 3) a huge scary zit.  Do not walk  run to buy this if you have dry weird skin.
3034,Family7,1,04-Nov-17, ,Would give it 4.3 stars. First of  regarding packaging  it came in with lid half way twisted open  contents would have easily spilled  but in my case didn’t. It should have a sealed plastic cover - it didn’t have it. Regarding the cream itself  it has hyalurenic acid  which is great! It is fragrance free  gentle on my skin  and it states it has this technology where hydration is released throughout the entire day. It did  indeed  stay on my face and hands well and did not make my skin look oily. It felt great and was not heavy. Definitely protected me from the extremely cold weather that we have here in NY. Two things I wished it had  more organic or non gmo ingredients  and make it non comedogenic.
3035,EC,1,22-May-18,2 people found this helpful,This is a great product at a great price! I have combination skin that breaks out easily but also gets dry flaky patches. The CeraVe moisturizer works well at hydrating without causing a breakout. It is a very thick and smooth cream that might be too thick for some during the day.
3036,Tessa C.,1,29-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I love this moisturizer! I have been buying it for about 6 yrs and its worth it. I just now put this in my wish list since it is so expensive.  Its great for my super sensitive skin. Im very allergic to most the perfumes and scents they put in most other hand and body creams. It also helps with my ezcema due to dryness and stress. My doctor told me to try using CeraVe and I was AMAZED! I wont use anything else.
3037,kelsey,0,30-May-19,One person found this helpful,I have eczema problems every year. It s spring now  typically when i start to see it dissipate  but i had a small flare up above my eye lid so I decided to try this product out instead of using the steroid cream provided from my doctor. I have been using this for about a week now and noticed random other flare ups showing up on my face!! I also am noticing acne problems that I did not have before using this as a face moisturizer. I m going to use this as a body lotion from now  don t necessarily recommend this product for sensitive skin.
3038,Kemgbr,1,21-May-18,One person found this helpful,I really love this moisturizer. When I first opened it  I wasn t sure I would because the consistency seemed a bit different than what I was used to (seemed more wet and thicker than my normal lotion). However  it has worked wonders on my very dry skin. My legs get so dry that they get little bumps on them. This lotion cleared those. It goes on smoothly and the tub makes it quick and easy to apply.
3039,Anon E. Mousse,1,19-Jan-16,2 people found this helpful,All you need for face and body. This stuff is a miracle in a jar. It is incredibly moisturizing without being heavy or  wet  is all I can say. It has a difficult to describe texture but is not like most other creams in its category. I m guessing it s a property of the ceramides in it. It s kind of like filmy but not really  it s a bit like those makeup primers or bases  where you feel it forms a seal but a light one  not an overly dense greasy one. Anyway  I m so glad I stumbled upon this because I was so loyal to the competitor s brand  I only bought this one cause they were out of stock. This is now my go to moisturizer. It s even good for my lips.
3040,Nicole Del Sesto,1,11-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,My dermatologist recommended this brand because I have chronic eczema. I ve been using the lotion and face stuff for about a year now and I m happy with it. It s generally light and doesn t have a smell which is important for me.  I decided to try the cream because sometimes you need something a little heavier than the lotion. Heels  elbows  etc. The description says  daily face  - I personally would not use this on my face. Too heavy.
3041,L Allen,1,30-Mar-18, ,My favorite Face Cream. I use this with the CeraVe lotion for my face. This adds the extra moisture layer for under my eyes  and dry spots on my face. I use this and the CreraVe lotion for my face. I use the cream for extra dry spots and under my eyes. I have very sensative skin  and other lotions make me itch or breakout  CeraVe Cream & Lotions Do Not. These are amazing and are my face keepers. No more dry & itchy face Can be worn under make up Lightweight & Deep Moisturizing No Breakouts No Shiny or Slick Face
3042,DIANE S.,1,25-Jul-13, , I LIKE IT  IS ENOUGH. I RESENT THAT YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE FIVE WORDS I WAS WILLING TO TYPE IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS. ISN T IT ENOUGH THAT I SAID SOMETHING POSITIVE AND REPLIED AT ALL?. I THINK YOU HAVE RUDELY LAID AN EXPECTATION UPON ME - VALUED CUSTOMER? - I MAY NOT BE BACK TO YOUR COMANY BECAUSE OF IT.
3043,R. Kaufmann,1,20-May-18, ,I use moisturizer daily to avoid scratchy skin. My dermatologist told me to avoid anything with fragrances  and my  go to  product has been?Vanicream  which is awesome. The CeraVe works as well. It s a little less thick/goopy  which is nice. I only use it once a day  and it seems to last.  One note: the 19 oz. size does not come with a pump  so I suggest getting a different size that does have a pump  and then go for this bigger/more economical size as a refill.
3044,Kortney,1,26-Nov-18, ,I purchased this product at CVS instead of Amazon since I had a coupon. First time to try any of the CeraVe line... I ll just say I struggle with dry/dull skin because I use several products geared toward getting rid of acne and during winter its ten times worse. This lotion has transformed my skin. I use it on my face and body. I use it on my kids faces and their bodies as well. SO moisturizing. I will say  it is a heavier creamier lotion... so  if you can t handle that kind of thing on your face I wouldn t recommend. But  if you re looking for something very moisturizing this is your last stop!
3045,Sadie,1,25-Nov-17, ,This is a nice  thick cream for the entire body. It s great for people with dry skin. It goes no smoothly with no sticky feeling.  I love the jar because it s big enough to fit my hand inside. That way I can get all the lotion out. Pumps can be so annoying because they always stop pumping half way through. I always make sure my hands are clean before using this lotion so I don t transfer dirt into the lotion. Also  this is not the kind of container you re going to want to share with anyone for the same reason.
3046,Sherry,1,04-Jan-18, ,I tried this product because I really struggle with dry skin in winter. Nothing seems to work. I typically use bare minerals face wash  exfoliator  and moisturizer but it just isn t enough in the winter. I always get dry flaky skin. I applied moisturizer in the morning and night and still nothing. I didn t want to try a bunch of expensive products so when I saw how many of the reviews were positive for this product I figured I d give it a try. My skin is very sensitive and acne prone so I was worried this would give me breakouts as some of the reviews said that was an issue. But I have been using this for about a month now  no breakouts. In fact they seem to have improved now that I don t have dry flaky skin blocking my pores. My skin is nice and soft again and not flaky at all. Its such a relief to not have my makeup all caked up and gross looking. I would not  however  recommend using this before you apply makeup. I still use my bare minerals moisturizer before I put makeup on because when I tried to use this all the foundation really stuck to it and applied really thick. It just didn t go well. But I use this in the morning and at night and just use bare minerals moisturizer when I put makeup on. My skin is happy and I m super happy.
3047,me,1,20-May-18,One person found this helpful,I have had special dermatologist formulated creams and tried most every name brand lotion for most of my life. I have dry skin and could never find one that worked that didn t irritate or feel like grease. This is the best. Fantastic moisturizer with no greasy feel that lasts all day.
3048,W. Smith,0,14-Mar-17,One person found this helpful,I bought this to help with my eczema  but it burns when I first put it on my skin. I can t believe dermatologists recommend a product that so many people have experienced negative side effects to. The manufacturers need to find some more natural ingredients to replace whatever chemicals are burning people s skin. This product isn t some miracle product that has helped my eczema  so I have wasted my money on a chemical-filled product that is bad for people with sensitive skin.
3049,countingblessings,1,15-Feb-18,One person found this helpful,I love this cream for my body. I don’t use it on my face because it dries matte and there’s no greasiness whatsoever after it dries. I like something greasier for my dry thirsty facial skin  like a balm. For my face at night  I’m using La Roche Posay Lipikar Balm AP+ (it has shea butter and niacinamide).
3050,jeanneserenity,1,12-Jul-18, ,This is the best moisturizing cream. I prefer this over the Cetaphil version. It does not leave me feeling greasy  it absorbs well and it is recommended by my dermatologist. I love the large size of this container. This one does not come with a pump so keep that in mind if you need one. I had one from an empty container so I just swapped the tops. I have this on Subscribe and Save so I am never without it.
3051,hotdogzrule,1,08-Mar-19, ,I ve been using Cetaphil forever for my eczema which is alright. Someone suggested Cerave to me. It s.... a million times better. If your skin can tolerate the oiliness  I recommend putting this on at night and then adding a layer of aquaphor/vaseline on top to further lock in the moisture if your eczema is really bad like mine was. Somehow it was super flaky and dry the day before I started using this and the next day  it was looking pretty good and I wasn t embarrassed to go to work with my face falling apart lol.
3052,G. Hearn,1,16-Nov-17, ,For the price  and for the size  this is really great moisturizing cream. It comes in a large tub. I will say that when it arrived  there was cream on the top and around the edges of the container  so I had some cleaning-up to do. It would be nice if they sealed the top with a sheet of plastic. There is really no odor at all. It’s very creamy. Kind of like soft butter (I cook a lot! Hahaha) It’s easy to apply and doesn’t leave any greasy residue. A really great value.
3053,Where the Sidewalk Ends,1,25-May-18, ,This cream does an amazing job at moisturizing without leaving that greasy feel behind. My skin feels great for hours after use. I especially like using this cream after I ve been working/cooking and I ve had to clean my hands often  where the water has dried them out. Rubbing some of this onto my hands  they feel so much better. The moisturizer relieves the tight  irritated feeling of dried out skin. Works wonderfully!
3054,Emily,1,27-Feb-19, ,This stuff is great! It feels so good on my skin  particularly in the winter when it can be very dry. It is so thick and powerful that I can tell if I put it on the night before when I m washing my face in the morning because it almost feels like it just went on. It also feels clean and despite its thickness  did not increase my acne.
3055,CoCo s Mom,1,03-Nov-17, ,CeraVe gas been around for over 10 years. It was developed with dermatologists and is accepted by the National Eczema Association. As a person with eczema  I did not waste time putting the moisturizing cream on my hands  arms legs and on my face and neck. These are all the areas that need the most attention and are most visible to others. My skin absorbed the cream immediately. Where ever I put the moisturizer  it is softer and looks as if it has been hydrated. Love this.
3056,parcpalc,1,30-Jun-16,One person found this helpful,I ve only tried aveeno s baby Lotion for eczema therapy and this product to relieve/control my eczema. So far this product works really well if i use it everyday. Typically i apply it after i shower. But if i skip a day or two then my skin gets noticeably worse. I haven t gotten my skin to be completely clear of eczema but I m also bad consistently applying it everyday.  In comparison the aveeno Lotion didn t so anything for my eczema. Maybe because it was lotion meant for babies and I m an adult?
3057,sf618b,0,21-Mar-16,7 people found this helpful,This contains soy derived ingredients and the bottle is not marked  and I m angry about it. My 3 year old has a soy allergy and I put this on her after her tub last night! She was up all night crying and itching and ended up needing a double dose of benadryl. I will literally never  ever buy this lotion again. Horrible manufacturing practices. Label your products or stop putting cheap rancid soy in everything!
3058,KeefeKlan,1,23-Sep-16,2 people found this helpful,Love this product! Nothing compares. It works for oily  dry  eczema prone or acne prone skin. You can wear it under makeup and won t make things slide around. I work for a dermatologist and we must recommend this 20 times a day. You won t be disappointed. Its a rich formula but is not oily  unlike the Cetaphil brand cream. The  I ve got lotion on  feeling goes away in like 2 minutes. I think we have 3 open tubs in the house right now. Its a must have!
3059,Julie,1,05-Dec-17, ,Love this cream. It is so much thicker and moisturizing than the Aveeno in a similar container. I prefer a tube  but if you like the jar  you will love this lotion. I m one who would just buy the brand on sale  thinking they are all the same  but CeraVe stands apart. My pediatrician specifically recommended the brand for my daughter s sensitive skin in the winter and it worked and kept us from prescription lotions when applied twice daily.
3060,PghYinzer,1,25-Dec-10,2 people found this helpful,After a VERY unsuccessful attempt to treat my son s eczema with natural remedies  our derm suggested this cream. It wasn t that I was opposed to  main stream  treatments  it s just that so many raved about the California Baby stuff  and it was the only thing my son didn t say burned. Well it did not work for us. He ended up with a staph infection requiring antibiotics and back on the icky prescription ointment for the eczema. Once the ointment got things calmed down  we switched over to this - and we LOVE it. It it very easy to apply - I can just rub the extra into my hands like hand cream  it s not so greasy you need to wash it off. It soaks in nicely. It doesn t burn. And his legs are SO soft now. I wish I had known about this stuff years ago. I can t believe I never heard of it until now. Our derm s office sells it for cheaper than here  and I found it for even less at a certain red circled chain store. Even at the price listed here  though  it s reasonable for how well it works and how pleasant it is to use. I m hoping this becomes our #1 weapon against eczema.
3061,Frugal Shopaholics,1,24-Nov-18, ,I ve used every moisturizing cream there is. Nothing keeps my skin moisturized ALL day like this  especially in the colder months when my skin is extra dry itchy skin. It contains ceramides and hyaluronic acid which is good for people with eczema or dry skin. As an eczema sufferer I can not go without this cream. I go through a jar every few weeks. I use it from head to toe. It s also good for repairing damaged or irritated skin. If you haven t had much luck with other moisturizers  try this!
3062,Amazon Customer,1,05-Jun-16,One person found this helpful,I am 22 years old and have had mild to moderate acne for about 10 years. A few weeks ago I started using Epiduo for the second time as it is the product that has helped my skin the most. I wasn t seeing too much improvement in the first few weeks (which is typical)  and my skin was SO SO dry.  I bought this moisturizer because I knew it was so highly recommended and OH MY GOSH. Not only did all the dryness of my skin disappear in ONE DAY (and the dryness hasn t returned since)  but my acne is literally vanishing!! Even after the first day there was a HUGE improvement  and the few pimples that are left are now MUCH easier to cover with makeup without it just looking super terrible.  I now realize the dryness of my skin was probably keeping my acne from healing/going away  but NO MORE!  Seriously  y all. BUY THIS STUFF BECAUSE YOU WON T REGRET IT. I hardly ever write product reviews but I had to on this one because DANG.
3063,RAYA STEIER,1,26-Jun-19, ,This cream fixed my skin s texture and it helps prevent breakouts on my face. Best moisturizer I have ever used  period.  The cream is slightly thick and has no scent-- it s ideal for night time use. I use the lighter Cerave PM during the daytime under sunscreen.
3064,Amazon Customer,0,25-Aug-17,One person found this helpful,BROKE ME OUT!! Noticed 2 bumps after first use. Then three...four..five...now my entire face is clogged pores galore. Even my eyebrows & eyelids have tiny bumbs  which has never happened before! Turns out  for a lot of people  Cerave caused closed comodones  aka breakouts. Also made my face greasy & shiny. Its a great moisturizer. My skin was definitely moisturized  but breakouts is not a worthwhile tradeoff. Stop using.
3065,hanamana,0,03-Sep-18,One person found this helpful,After using for a few days (2-3 days)  the affected area start getting red bumps (rashes) with severe dryness and irritation. Without knowing  I was applying more and more thinking my dry skin would improve  yet it was making it worse. After realizing that the dryness could be from the lotion  I immediately took a shower and applied my regular lotion  which felt a lot more soothing. Allergic reactions can happen from any skin products  but be aware of potential side effects from this particular product.
3066,Pink.In.A.Blue.World,1,27-Mar-18, ,Thrilled with this cream. It is creamy  smooth and soothing. Non-greasy. Hypoallergenic. Since stopping an expensive branded product I d been using for many years  I have been using this moisturizer and face wash and it makes my skin feel luxurious... way better than on the expensive brand I was using before. My skin feels supple  soft and healthy. I highly recommend it.
3067,Jennifer Donovan,1,22-Jun-18, ,This has always been  the gold standard  in lotions. My daughter has used it on her eczema and winter dry sky for a long time. I was glad to find it in this large size for convenient delivery.  I was also glad to see it has hyaluronic acid. I didn t realize that it did  and that s definitely my favorite anti-aging ingredient!
3068,Brandi Smith,1,25-Mar-19, ,I was using a Mary Kay moisturizer for acne prone skin (because I have acne)   and I felt like I was just rubbing water on my face. This cream is very thick and absorbes into your skin very easily!! I love it and I also have sensitive skin and it is very refreshing on my face. My skin is terribly dry and I had to put vasiline on it all the time until I got this moisturizer. It has worked wonders for me and comes with tons of product!!! I love it and I suggest buying it if you have acne  has sensitive and dry skin.
3069,Dmitry Kristal,1,10-Jun-18, ,This is a great all-purpose cream. I had no idea how giant this 19 ounce tub really was bigger than I thought. I d be surprised if I use it all up before the expiration date. I used other Cerave products in the past that were recommended by salons  so this was not a surprise of how great this moisturizing cream was. Goes on smooth and its not too greasy.
3070,Wandrwoman,1,23-Jul-14,One person found this helpful,I am totally obsessed with this moisturizing body cream. It is totally delicious to use  it sinks in quickly  and it leaves the skin silky soft and smooth.  It contains excellent ingredients including ceramides and hyaluronic acid. The texture of this product is whipped and creamy. There is no discernable fragrance  which to me is a good thing.  As if this wasn t enough  a giant 16 oz. tub costs under fifteen dollars  even less if you buy it at a big box store that starts with a C and ends with an O.  I wish it had a pump dispenser  although I understand you can purchase one that screws on to the existing tub.  All in all  a wonderful product!
3071,B,1,08-Jul-14, ,My skin was acting really weird  oily but dry at the same time (dehydrated it sea) and this really helped fix that. I was worried it was going to break me out but it doesn t  and I am very acne prone. It feels nice going on  but feels kind of tacky until it dries. It doesn t have much of a smell  and is cheap for how much you get! I don t like that it s in a jar especially since it s such a large jar that will take a while to use up  so I bought a pump for it on separately here on amazon. This product would be good for people with combination or dry skin  but probably too heavy for oily skin. I also like using it all over my body  especially my upper arms where I have KP (keratosis pilaris/ chicken skin ) as it s very moisturizing and seems to help with the KP a bit.
3072,Amazon Customer,1,09-Apr-18, ,Might be a little early to be writing a review  as I ve only had this for about 5 days - but I can t help it  I m in love with CeraVe so far! I ve pretty much always had skin on the drier side  but this past winter has been unlike any other. I have been experiencing the driest skin I ve ever had  and have been trying numerous different products  from drug store to high end. Nothing was working - I have been so flakey and because of that  my makeup/foundation has been looking so awful since it s on such dry skin. Finally  I tried CeraVe as a last resort  thinking it wouldn t work  but I couldn t be more wrong! After as little as two days  I started seeing results! My face feels so hydrated and I can t wait to see what it ll look like with continued use! You get a big jar of it for around $12 - it will last so long. Highly highly recommend!
3073,Dean Burns,1,23-Jun-18, ,This is my go-to lotion when my skin starts to get dry and itchy  especially in dry winter weather. It absorbs well and doesn t leave my skin feeling slick and greasy. A little goes a long way and it keeps my skin soft and hydrated for hours. One application in the morning and another at bedtime does it for me. Great stuff.
3074,Ana Rivera,0,11-Jan-19, ,When I bought it was working really well  no dry skin or flakes. But then if I used it after washing my face I had a burning sensation. Some said it was because of dry skin. But I ve tried cetaphil (more oily) and Vanicream and haven t had any burning. And btw Vanicream is great!
3075,Shelby Kirk,1,05-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,I SWEAR BY THIS STUFF! I love love love makeup and have normal/dry skin. The skin on my nose always peels and gets dryer after a few days of makeup. After a lot of research  I came across CeraVe and ordered myself a huge tub of it. I has changed my life! Not only does it deeply moisturize my face  but also helped clear my acne. I couldn t recommend this stuff enough.
3076,Shae,1,27-Jul-12,One person found this helpful,This product was one on a list my dermatologist recommended to me. It was the only one that I found worked in every way needed. I HATE to  feel  lotion sitting on my skin. This is the ONLY cream/lotion (I ve used both) that actually absorbs into my skin. It takes a few minutes but it is amazing. I definitely have seen an improvement in my eczema and I have noticed and improvement in my skin. It is softer and more moisturized now more than ever. I only use this product and no other lotions  and it works well on any part of the body. I do prefer the cream to the lotion. It works better to me and is thicker/more concentrated. I ve been using this product daily for over 4 years now. Oh and it lasts a long time too! It works best when used immediately after baths or showers.

It is a miracle combination!! I had the red puffy eyelid skin for years on and off and have not had an episode for 2 years now! The other caveat that came along with using this is no acne! I am 48 and still would get the occasional annoying zits and wondering if I would every outgrow them. Not only have I not had one breakout  but my skin is all the same color - no blotchiness or uneveness. It totally transformed my skin. I can actually go out without make-up  which I have never done since age 18. Now all I need is eyeliner and a little blush and I am out the door. I wouldn t live without this stuff. In the summer I use the lotion on my face because it s not as heavy. I am so glad I finally bit the bullet and went to the dermatologist and was told about this great cream. After a while  you figure one cream is as good as the other and what s the point  but this stuff is the best. Curel Ulra Healing is THE best for hands  elbows  feet  etc. because it has the best staying power  but this stuff is a great overall lotion that you can use on your face and not be afraid of breaking out. It was developed by a dermatologist and it works!

I USE THS AS A BODY AND NECK CREAM ALSO ON MY FEET AT NIGHT IT HAS TOTALLY TRANSFORMED THEM!!!!!II AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT!!
3079,Marianna Kalabin,1,15-Dec-18, ,The best cream I’ve ever tried! I have very dry skin and have tried so many different products including raw coconut oil - nothing helped. I ordered this cream without any high expectations but WOW!!! It keeps my skin so soft and hydrated. And it absorbs to my skin pretty fast too. Absolutely recommend!!!
3080,?Seas the Day?,1,22-May-18, ,Cerave is my favorite moisturizer. Cerave is moisturizing and has essential ceramides. Cerave is a thick cream but is easy to apply and soaks in well. It is suited for body and face but I only use it for my face  neck  and chest. I have dry skin and Cerave is all I need to keep my skin moisturized and soft.
3081,T-Dubbs,1,06-Nov-18, ,Does its job well. Great moisturizer and absorbs quickly  so you don t have to deal with that gooey feeling on your skin long. Plus the cost/value can t be beat  this stuff could put the competition out of business with a better marketing model.
3082,Acacia Raines,1,05-Jun-13,3 people found this helpful,This product is one of the best I ve ever used. Mind you I ve never had horrible acne  a few tiny tiny white heads around my nose (to small to pop...sorry gross) and the occasional one on my forehead or hair line. I had bad back acne though.I ve recently started taking Biotin (10 000 mcg daily) and a lot of people said they broke out while taking it so I started using CeraVe AM  and CeraVe pm. I ve been using it for a little over a week and 90% of my back acne has cleared up and my face looks amazing. I ve tried other products in the past but they just dried up my skin and occasionally made it worse  but this stuff actually makes my skin softer. I love it.
3083,Big AL,1,26-Dec-17, ,CeraVe Moisturizing Cream: This is a great product for Rosacea  Flushing  and Dry skin. Used it for 5 years. PLEASE keep in mind this product contains no sun block and will actually intensify sun rays to the skin. You should not use this product if your going to be in direct sun light. This has been my experience. I m now reviewing adding a sun block before applying this moisturizer.
3084,Sueb,1,15-Dec-18, ,Great product because my skin felt so nice after I used this for the first time. We all have tried so many different products  but I think this is a wonderful product. My skin loves this ! What an outstanding product with an outstanding price.
3085,Mimi,1,04-Oct-18, ,I live in a dry and cold climate and am constantly needing to apply moisturizer. Especially come winter time. CeraVe has been a long time go to brand for my eczema needs. I like that it is fragrance free and is gentle enough for my sensitive skin.
3086,Michelle sweeney,1,17-Jan-18, ,This winter my face has been extra dry to the point of causing a burning sensation when it was touched or when I would try to smile. My normal face lotion (Lubriderm) could no longer keep up. The only relief I found was slathering aquaphor all over my face at night. The aquaphor helped but I could only use it at night as it was extremely greasy and it also caused me to have small breakouts around my mouth and cheeks. I m so happy I found this product! I ve been using the cerave moisturizing cream for 3 days and have already seen and felt a huge difference.i apply it on my face morning and night after cleansing with noxema classic clean cleanser. No breakouts and dryness/redness going away. Worth the price forsure!
3087,Preston Kuhn,0,20-Nov-17, ,I was recommended to try this and I absolutely hate it unfortunately. It burns when you put it on which is a sign of high amounts of alcohol which is bad for sensitive skin/ eczema. Looked at the ingredients and alcohol is very high up on the list. I’d highly recommend you try vanicream!!! I use it on my entire face and body and nothing else has been able to restore moisture to my sensitive skin like that stuff. Minnesota winters are tough. Good luck everyone!
3088,Andrew J. Keegan,1,21-Sep-18, ,While I use a medication on the really dry psoriasis patches  this cream does a remarkable job on the rest of my skin. Non-greasy and easy to apply using the big tub. I ve tried a ton of moisturizing creams/lotions and to-date  this is the only one that works for me.
3089,RER,1,23-Feb-19, ,I have very dry- thin skin and this stuff is great. I use to get cuts very easily from brushing against something. This no longer happens. I guess my skin is more flexible is the only way I can explain it.
3090,Daisy70,1,27-Apr-14, ,I had laser resurfacing on my face 3 weeks ago and it is soooo dry  even the Cetaphil the doc told me was a good one to use didn t help the horrible dryness I was experiencing. I looked around on the web and saw plenty of places where it was highly recommended. I slathered some on my face last night and it literally seemed that my skin was drinking it up! This morning I woke up to a soft and smooth face. It clearly doesn t just kind of sit on the skin as many other moisturizer seems to do  this actually is drawn in by your face. And it s cheap  too. A bought $15 for a huge tub that will last for several months!
3091,Kwagner,1,06-Nov-17, ,CeraVe Moisturizing Cream is fantastic! I love it. My skin is always at least a little dry. It gets worse in colder weather  of course  due to the heat. This light  smooth cream works better than most at smoothing out and moisturizing my skin. This is one of my top three favorite moisturizing products.
3092,Josephine,1,12-Jan-19, ,I love this! Winter in Alaska can be hard on the skin  and my upper arms usually get bumpy and scaly  but not anymore. I put this on my arms  chest  and feet after every shower and my skin feels amazing. Highly recommend. I’ve been using it regularly for about a month and I absolutely love it.
3093,Cindy B.,1,07-Mar-19, ,My knuckle was cracked  sore and so rough. With just one treatment the crack sealed over and I believe one more treatment will make the area smooth again. the best ever.
3094,sayeun,1,03-May-18, ,After an outbreak of eczema  my dermatologist recommend I use this brand instead of all of the other lotion brands I ve been using. I must say I m impressed how well this works. I was a bit skeptical this would cause my to breakout since it s kind of heavy  but after a week of using it  no obvious breakouts. My skin is super smooth and soft after using this twice a day all over my face and body. It s kind of weird to have skin this soft since I ve always had  red  dry  and irritated skin. The tub is huge  though I m burning through it quickly since I m using it liberally.

3096,Jeffrey Porter,0,29-Mar-17,2 people found this helpful,With regards to their FAQ about the presence of parabens in their product. Here is some more recent research: Abstract This toxicology update reviews research over the past four years since publication in 2004 of the first measurement of intact esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (parabens) in human breast cancer tissues  and the suggestion that their presence in the human body might originate from topical application of bodycare cosmetics. The presence of intact paraben esters in human body tissues has now been confirmed by independent measurements in human urine  and the ability of parabens to penetrate human skin intact without breakdown by esterases and to be absorbed systemically has been demonstrated through studies not only in vitro but also in vivo using healthy human subjects. Using a wide variety of assay systems in vitro and in vivo  the oestrogen agonist properties of parabens together with their common metabolite (p-hydroxybenzoic acid) have been extensively documented  and  in addition  the parabens have now also been shown to possess androgen antagonist activity  to act as inhibitors of sulfotransferase enzymes and to possess genotoxic activity. With the continued use of parabens in the majority of bodycare cosmetics  there is a need to carry out detailed evaluation of the potential for parabens  together with other oestrogenic and genotoxic co-formulants of bodycare cosmetics  to increase female breast cancer incidence  to interfere with male reproductive functions and to influence development of malignant melanoma which has also recently been shown to be influenced by oestrogenic stimulation.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18484575
3097,Leticia Winnick,1,15-Jul-12,3 people found this helpful,Before bed  I tried the CeraVe Moisturizing Cream on the left side of my face and around my left eye  while I tried Olay Age Defying Intensive Nourishing Night Cream on the right side of my face and Olay Age Defying Eye Gel around my right eye. In the morning  the left side of my face (where I used the CeraVe product) was softer and more moisturized  even around my left eye. I bought the CeraVe product at Target for $12.99 and the Olay products at CVS for a little more since there are two of them (about $10 each). Keep in mind that CeraVe comes in a 16 oz jar while Olay comes in a 2 oz jar (the eye gel is half an oz). I personally will stick with CeraVe for night time use. However  if you are allergic to parabens beware. CeraVe does contain parabens while the Olay products don t. CeraVe is accepted by the National Eczema Association though. It s your call.
3098,advocate_of_joy,1,23-Feb-17, ,My Baby has a severe eczema  for weeks we been looking for a solution. We were recommend by this from a family doctor. This stuff work the best. I wanted to let other parent know that this product might work with your baby skin . This product work for my kids. In the morning  afternoon and early evening  I would put Cerave Moist on my kids face and body. At night when bed time  i use Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream for relieves itchy and irritated skin on my boy face so he can sleep well. My kids started taking it on Sunday  and it now Thursday. The different like night and day.
3099,Dixie,1,04-Jan-15,2 people found this helpful,I use this cream because it was recommended by my dermatologist for dry skin. The product prevents dry skin and is an excellent after bath cream to keep skin soft and moist. I have recommended it to many friends and everyone that tries it continues to use it. Great product. It does feel a little greasy when applied  but is absorbed well when worked into the skin.
3100,Amazon Customer,1,13-Feb-19, ,I have terrible skin that is always dry no matter how often I apply lotion. I ve tried cetaphil  the almond lotions from Nivea  etc. This is the only lotion that makes my skin feel like skin again. After looking and looking I am honestly so happy to have found this product.
3101,Nancy Tomberlin,1,23-May-18, ,I bought this because the reviews were good and the price was right. I wanted a total body moisturizer that wasn’t heavy and had a noticeable affect. This product has so far met my expectations.
3102,Jay,0,10-Apr-19,One person found this helpful,my skin felt so itchy after applying it  the next day  i got some little bumps on my skin. i love the smell but i dont recommend it for people that have sensitive skin like me.
3103,Rei,0,22-Jan-16,8 people found this helpful,I really wanted to like this moisturizing cream because of all the skin-nourishing ingredients in it (namely ceramide and hyaluronic acid. Moreover  the price point was appealing to me. Unfortunately  my face hated it. I broke out into closed comedones in areas where I ve never broken out before a few days after using the moisturizing cream (I was using no new skincare/makeup products  so I was sure this was the culprit). I stopped using it for a week  and my face healed after I went back to my old moisturizer.  However  I tried the Cerave moisturizing cream a second time since I didn t want to give up after a few uses  and once again  it broke me out. Moreover  it caused the skin around the outer edges of my eyes and lips to become dry  flaky  and irritated. I did look up what other people said online  and fortunately  my situation wasn t unique  and other people have also had bad reactions to this moisturizing cream. Again  I wish it worked for me since it is a holy grail product for a lot of people  but unfortunately  I most likely won t be using any Cerave products again.
3104,BookshireCrone,0,22-Oct-17, ,My dermatologist recommended this (gave me a coupon actually) & so I purchased 3 or 4 CeraVe products. (Fighting a latex allergy that messed up my hands).. I went through a whole tub of this particular CeraVe & found that it was not really that helpful. In the end  Eucerin sensitive skin excema relief was the best at combating my problem. When I could I used Plain petroleum jelly with cotton gloves  which helped the most. For actual moisturizing & keeping my cracked skin supple when not using the Vaseline I used cetaphil cream . This product went on like a moist fluffy cloud & then dried too quickly leaving my skin visibly dry  even when applied every 30 min. So I m not really a fan of this & gave away my second tub.
3105,charity,1,19-Nov-16, ,I m not sure why people say it a miracle. I spent 17$ for this product. I have to put layer after layer.and my cheeks are still not moisturized and tight.plus don t put it any where near the eyes.It ll burn all day. I can t even use makeup. Disappointed I ll give it longer. Maybe my skin is supper bad.
3106,Book lover,1,06-Nov-17, ,The skin on my face is dry and I have tried the CeraVe Moisturizing Cream for a week. It makes my skin feel softer and my pliable. It does not have an odor and is not greasy. I am glad I have found this wonder moisturizer cream.
3107,Eki,1,21-Aug-09,3 people found this helpful,My little girl has eczema and gets rashes on her skin. I have tried everything - from over the counter to what the doctors prescribed - nothing took the redness and rashes away. That is  until I tried CeraVe. A friend from work recommended it and the same night I went to buy it at a drugstore. It is expensive but I thought  well  my little girl is worth it if it works. After just a few applications (I put it on her in the evening and in the morning)  the rash that was inside her elbow for several months (and that we treated with all kinds of things  including antibiotics)  is starting to disappear! The skin in that area is becoming smooth (it was very rough) and light again (at times it looked completely inflamed and once even oozed). I am completely marveled at how this cream works. I would not use anything else on my little one from now on. Try it for yourself  you will not regret it!
3108,Brittney,1,19-May-15, ,For the past year I have suffered with extremely dry  cracked  red  inflammed  and tight skin. I had a neurological disease that caused muscle tightness  so at first I thought nothing of the severe tightness and discomfort I felt on my skin. Over the last 6 months my face only worsened  and I ended up in the ER with severely inflamed and damaged skin. All my life I have had beautiful skin  so I couldn t figure out what was happening. I tried every OT and prescription that the dermatologist could prescribe  but my skin seemed to dislike it all. I was given everything from hydrocortisone to antibiotic creams  spending hundreds of dollars that I didn t have to spend. Finally  I went into a Duane Reade and stumbled across the last tube of CeraVe moisturizing cream and decided to try one final attempt to soothe my skin. It hasn t even been a week and my skin has improved drastically. The cracking has decreased  and all of the burning has stopped! I can t wait until my skin is 100% This stuff is amazing!!!!
3109,HulaHolly78,1,28-Mar-19, ,Best moisturizer money can buy. My dermatologist recommended it to me. I was surprised at how big the jar I received was. And the price was better than anywhere else.
3110,S. Stein,1,16-Dec-12,4 people found this helpful,Cerave moisturizing cream is an excellent non-greasy cream for dry  sensitive  mature skin types. This product comes in a generous 16 oz. jar that easily should last 6 months or longer. The cream has a key ingredient   hyaluronic acid. This ingredient plays an important part in replenishing and repairing the moisture barrier. Numerous skin conditions are affected by the skin barrier; eczema  wrinkles  aging skin. This cream is superb at moisturizing the skin as to helping the skin barrier heal. What I love about this cream are the generous size  very affordable price  and all the skin benefits from the ingredients. I believe this is the best moisturizer on the market.I also love the fact that after applying in am  the skin is hydrated for the day. Cerave cream can be used from head to toe. No need to buy separate products for the face. It is super in the winter  but I use it year round. I even use this cream for my dry eye area. I would definitely recommend Cerave moisturizing cream for the following skin types: dry  sensitive  mature. I don t think this cream is appropriate for oily or combo skin types due to the richness of the cream. I have noticed a huge reduction of the severity of facial wrinkles  especially forehead and cheek areas. It has greatly soothed my reactive sensitive skin. This product can be found at Wal-Mart  Target  Walgreen  Amazon  etc. for $14-$17. Update: I have found this cream to be excellent on the hands and cuticles as well.
3111,Jonathan Stokar,1,16-Dec-18, ,This is the best cream I’ve ever used on my face and wish I had found it sooner (bought it when a new retionoid cream burned my face). I own literally every brand of fancy moisturizer? La mer  goop  Aesop  Clinique? and cannot believe I wasted all that money when this was what I’ve always needed  for 1/8 of the price!

3114,Lindsay,1,30-Dec-17, ,This saved my dry skin. The back of my hands get extremely dry--to the point of bleeding--and this completely hydrates them without being greasy. Some other lotions irritate my sensitive skin  but this does not at all. This lotion has gotten my hands through multiple winters.
3115,Gravecat,1,08-Nov-12,5 people found this helpful,My face is dry and sensitive...getting more so with the passing years. I m a  product junkie  and  though careful what I use  especially on my face  I will try new things.  My face pulls a lot of red  especially in the cheeks. Not attractive  espeically if you want to go make-up free for the day. You name it  I ve tried it and the last product I bought for redness was Aveeno Calming Lotion. It didn t do a thing for me and  oh yeah  it is loaded with sunscreen which my face cannot tolerate at all. The fumes from it make my eyes irritated and watery all day whenever I wore it.  I know everyone preaches sunscreen  and I m not against it but for it. However  if you are very sensitive like I am  the stuff is just an irritating nightmare to have on your face  neck and anywhere near your eyes.  Besides Aveeno not helping my redness  I was on the hunt again for something....  Enter Cerave.  After reading the awesome reviews on Amazon here  I decided to try it. Strange that when I decided to buy it I seemed to catch commercials for it on T.V....something I never saw before.  Anyway  WOW! What a fabulous cream for your face  around your eyes (didn t irritate at all) and neck....and anywhere!  Do not be mislead by the word  cream . I think sometimes when you hear that  you think  heavy    greasy    sits on top . Not so with marvelous Cerave!  This product is stellar. It not only feels cool  comforting and creamy  but it sinks right into your face and neck (and anywhere else you need it  too).  I ve tried other products that sink right in  only to have my face and neck feel dried out not too long after.  Not so with marvelous Cerave.  It sinks in  but hydrates your skin so wonderfully. Let s face it  the top layer of our skin gets assaulted all day and all night with heat during the cold months  sun and wind  stress...you name it. That top  protective barrier on our skin needs protection! And it needs something that sinks in and helps it say hydrated all day and night. This is your product!  It is marvelous on make-up free days  or under your make-up. If you prep your skin and help it to be moist before you put make-up on  it goes on much better and helps to protect your skin  too.  I can t say enough about it. I returned my new bottle of Aveeno to the store and got my $16.00 bucks back. Cerave is all I use now. I can t believe how it has helped my redness  helps my dry  sensitive skin stay moist all day  and helps my face to look  even   not blotchy and red - even when I go make-up free.  If you have beautiful skin  you can go make-up free with confidence. I love make-up...I m a real  girlie-girl   but when I choose not to wear it for whatever reason  I want my skin to look fresh  lovely and even. Cerave helps me do that.  I just love this product. I think you will too.
3116,Jesse H.,1,05-Oct-17, ,IT WORKS!!!!! Out of no where I started having flaky patches on my chin. It soon spread to my forehead and cheeks! I took a trip to walmart and picked this stuff up and it did the trick. Also  my skin feels damn GREAT! Good product will keep buying.

3130,CKY9,1,21-Dec-11,One person found this helpful,I ve had eczema since I was a kid and once I hit 25  my skin also became very sensitive. There are several cleansers  lotions  sunscreens and make-up brands that make my skin burn or turn splotchy and red. I got a CeraVe sample from my dermatologist--both the lotion and the cream. It immediately replaced my moisturizer. It was summer time so I used the lotion first and bought a full size. Then winter rolled around and I started feeling like the lotion wasn t enough. I pulled out the cream sample  loved it and went to buy the full size too. I never transitioned back to the lotion--the cream just seems to go further for me.  After 2 and a half years using this  my skin is healthy and hydrated. I use it everyday in the morning and at night. Because it s a little expensive  I only use it on my face but in the winter  I spot treat dry patches on my arms and legs and I like to rub the leftover on my hands. I put it on my husband s face too after he shaves and he likes it a lot.
3131,Jacki S Martin,1,13-Feb-18, ,Great stuff. I spend a fair amount of money on skin products (Obagi C  Retin A  Neocutis eye cream) but with a well formulated inexpensive cream like this one  I don t have to spend a lot on face or body moisturizer. Or  for that matter  sunscreen  as Cerave also makes a great sunscreen line. I really like it for winter  especially with indoor heating drying my skin out. I use it on my face and body. Great value.

I still needed to use OTC hydrocortisone cream along with it.My forehead still has itchy patches and my poor son didn t look like he used any moisturizer at all.

3133,Bre,1,27-Sep-14,3 people found this helpful,This is hands down the best moisturizer I have ever used. I ve had problem skin ever since middle school and dealt with mild acne. I would use acne products that would dry out my skin and irritate it and on top of that tried many different moisturizers to balance it out. I tried Clinique  and so many other expensive brands and found this one to be the best. My dermatologist recommended it to me.  Ever since I started using this my skin has become less oily on its own. I use it almost every night on my face after I wash my face and take all of my makeup off. Sometimes if my skin feels dry in the morning I ll put a little on before I apply makeup and its wonderful.  If you have oily skin I would suggest this product. If you don t moisturize your skin it will kick into overdrive and therefore produce more oil. This helps balance it out!

3138,Oriyomi,1,05-Jan-19, ,I’ve had severe painful eczema for as long as I can remember and no cream helped to keep moisture in my skin. This product works; my skin is so soft and supple throughout the day. I’ve never had soft skin! I just take a generous amount and rub it well in my skin after the shower. It really helps to calm my skin after flares.
3139,Paul Littlefield,1,25-Feb-18, ,My daughter has eczema that started on her cheeks then spread to her arms and behind her knees. Our pediatrician recommended Cerave to calm her skin and also a dietary supplement called SpoonfulOne that was developed by a Stanford doctor to prevent children from getting food allergies by training their immune systems via the diet to stay accustomed to all these foods. I LOVE both these products
3140,Wolf_of_Stocks,1,31-Mar-15,One person found this helpful,My skin type: Normal/Combination/Dry  Picked up Cerave Moisturizing Cream from the drugstore  after Cetaphil irritated my skin and left red patches on my cheeks. This is an excellent product and it hasn t irritated my skin at all or clogged any pores. Also it s not greasy which is a very good thing.  ***Tip: Don t apply the moisturizer right after washing the face with cleanser or after hot shower  i find that if i do that it irritates my skin. I usually apply it after 30min-1hour and ir doesnt irritate my skin. But everyone has different skin so might not work for all!

3149,A very tiny stockholder,1,22-Aug-13,6 people found this helpful,In January of 2013  I was in a serious auto accident and received a severe burn to my right wrist and arm. I am 75 years old and not overweight; so you know my injury was almost to the bone and very painful. In the ER I was instructed to re-bandage my injury with a OTC lotion or cream. Since I have been using all the CeraVe products for years  I naturally selected your moisturizing lotion. It was not only a great protection from the bandage  but eased the pain. I did at one point try the CeraVe cream  but found it not nearly as effective. I can t say enough good things about your product  and have turned many family members and friends into believers as well. People are always glad to open a gift and find CeraVe inside. The ending to my burn story is even more special. I have NO sign of a scar. Thank you for the most wonderful product I have ever used.

I wait an hour each night after applying the Retin A 0.025% so that the Cerave cream doesn t dilute the effect of the Retin A  then gently apply this. I am very happ with this cream - it has not caused any pimples and my skin feels good each morning after using it.

3156,HFPotier,1,24-Apr-14, ,Love this moisturizer. It was recommended by my dermatologist. It works really well. Doesn t make my skin red or burn like others I ve used. My skin hasn t looked this good in ages. Only problem is I can t put it on my eye lids  it irritates them. (they are the most sensitive area on my face.) Highly recommended if you have sensitive skin.
3157,E. angulo,0,05-Apr-14, ,I was really anticipating great results based off all the positive reviews I read here on people with eczema but was ultimately let down. Let me start with my skin condition. I ve been a long time sufferer of eczema since I was little. I believe I have what s called atopic dermatitis since I ve passed it on to my poor son  there s usually something that triggers my outbreaks such as a detergent  stress  etc. and I also get seasonal allergies. I get outbreaks mostly on the inside of my elbows  my neck  and my upper lip and forehead.  This past winter I had a major outbreak after what seemed like a lucky streak of no skin problems for a year. I had cracking  flaky skin on my forehead  we re talking Corn Flake sized skin peeling off  as well as dryness and irritation on my usual spots. Plus  it was itchy as hell  so it was clear I needed a better moisturizer. After some research and searching the net for an inexpensive moisturizer with ceramides  which I ve heard is good for eczema  I found this with a lot of good reviews. I was pretty ecstatic about trying it since it was relatively cheap and available pretty much anywhere. I decided to buy it from a local drugstore first to try it out.  When I first used it I wasn t thrilled about the consistency. It was really thick like yogurt and didn t really absorb well. It seems like it just rests on the surface of your skin and forms a film before actually absorbing. My regimen for moisturizing includes wetting my face then applying a series of creams and oils before it completely dries without using a towel. Basically  while my face is still damp I put oil  right now Im using squalane oil  then cream  on this case the Ceravae  and then a thick layer of petrolatum jelly over that. I was hoping that using this cream would help clear up my dry spell but it didn t do any better than what I was using before which was Aveeno Calming Daily moisturizing lotion. I ve been using Ceravae  since I got the 16 oz. jar  for about 2 months and haven t seen any improvement so I guess this isn t for my skin which really disappoints me. Oh well. Back to the drawing board.....By the way  I use a topical steroid cream  .05% for emergencies only like going to a big event  but lately it hasn t been working. It s not expired and I don t want to use anymore than I need. I wanna know if anyone s had any issues with steroid cream like this also.
3158,Carole,0,03-Sep-17, ,This product has some very bad ingredients especially petrolatum (a petroleum product) edta and parabens!!
3159,Amazon Customer,1,14-Jan-19, ,I have been enjoying this cream. I have very dry & itchy skin especially after shaving my legs due to my scleroderma & this has been so helpful It’s light not heavy or sticky but gives the results of a thick heavy cream.
3160,Sarah,1,14-Jan-18, ,It appears MANY of the reviews here are not for the correct product. People keep referring to the spf and/or niacinimide  neither of which are in the Moisturizing Cream. SPF is in the Cerave AM  niacinimide is in both the Cerave AM and Cerave PM formulas.

3163,Mari,0,06-Dec-18, ,I had been looking for body cream since given birth and my skin got really dry. After reading great reviews I decided to try this one. I liked this light texture and it absorbed quickly but my skin still really dry. Unfortunately It didn’t work for me.

3165,Sarah,1,06-Aug-12,5 people found this helpful,I added this product to my skin care routine a few weeks ago  and I can honestly say Ive seen a major difference in not only the texture  but the overall health of my skin! I  like many others here have suffered from mild eczema since I was a child  and my skin was definitely not in the best shape because of it. I tried so many other moisturisers from expensive creams to straight Vaseline. Nothing would take. I purchased this on a whim while at my local CVS and Im so glad I did!  I apply this cream all over my body (but no too much; a little bit really does go a long way) both in the morning after my shower  and at night right before I go to bed. And what a difference it s made! What I love most about this cream is how quickly it soaks in. Its not like a lot of other oils  where you have to stand around waiting for it to dry so you don t stain your comforter or your clothes. I love it. :)
3166,Mae B.,1,17-Dec-16, ,I have oily skin in the warmer months  but very dry skin in the cooler months. My makeup looked horrible because my face was so dry. Enter CeraVe. Combined with Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash and my Clarisonic  my skin looks and feels hydrated and healthy. My makeup also looks great. This cream does not break me out...so deep hydration and clear skin is a win-win!
3167,Alejandra Enriquez Castro,1,23-May-17, ,I ve tried a few different lotion to treat my dermatitis which appears in a lot of my skin  I ve tried different lotion but the texture of this one felt the best on my skin. I d recommend this one over its competitors.

3172,Pooz,1,13-Jan-11,4 people found this helpful,I LOOOOOVE this cream!!! I was looking for something that would help with my 1 year old daughters eczema and my sister told me about this. She used it as a moisturizer on skin prone to breakouts and raved about it. Luckily she e-mailed me a link with the reviews or otherwise I probably would have never bought it. My first thoughts were that it was a bit spendy  but after reading the reviews decided to try it out not expecting much.  Well  I can say that within a few days I noticed improvement and after a few weeks her eczema was almost completely clear. Her skin previously was very splotchy and red in all her creases bumpy on her stomach and back and it was so bad under her neck that her skin was splitting and getting infected. We have been using it since and honestly her skin is practically perfect. She has a few occasional very small bumps  but nothing compared to how it was and I don t have to use steroids  prescription meds.  hydrocortizone etc.  The texture of the cream feels heavy enough that it is not watered down  but so soft when it is on  and rubs in completely so you don t have to worry about it getting all over furniture  clothing etc. I have started using it myself quite a bit too because I love how it feels on my skin. We have very dry air where I live and it helps keep my skin smooth during winter months when it is extra dry.  The only other things I use on my daughters skin in conjunction with Cera Ve are Dreft detergent (which we have used since she was born) and Loreal Super Squirt 2 in 1Bodywash (which I got the same time as Cera Ve so I didn t know which was clearing the exzema until I stopped using Cera Ve for about a month or two and the eczema came back. I bought it again recently and it is clearing up again. Either way these products all seem to be a good combination for us especially the Cera Ve.?Dreft 2x Ultra Baby Liquid Laundry Detergent  50-Ounce (Pack of 2) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]

3177,Nancy,1,18-Jan-10,4 people found this helpful,I m not certain if my diagnosis is eczema  dermatitis  or other but the symptoms have been uncomfortable. I spend lots and lots of time recreating outdoors and live in arid Salt Lake City (it s dry even when it s rainy and snowy) and have dry  sensitive skin. Some years I ve gotten a rash when I wear wool sweaters and I m always itchy and flaky. This year was particularly bad. When it got cold out I started getting the usual wool rash. Then every part of my body started itching and I scratched to the point of bleeding. My dermatologist had me switch to Dove unscented soap. He also has me slather (my word) on CeraVe while I am still wet. I can t describe the difference. The almost unbearable itching has completely stopped and my skin feels wonderful. I don t love putting on the cream while I m wet and waiting for it to soak in but the results are remarkable and worth it. I ve started using it on my face the same way and then wait until it absorbs before using my other  potions .

His skin was getting better using aquaphor but the aquaphor was a little to heavy and was irritating his heat bumps so I thought this would be perfect. I feel awful that I put this on my baby! I wish I would have listened to the other reviews! Please do not put this on your baby! It has alcohol and that s probably what irritated my sons skin. I so regret using this!!!

The tub is huge  and I paid $15 for it my at a local drugstore. Anyone who thinks that is cream expensive has never paid for top-of-the-line moisturizers and lotions. I ve been using Kiehl s face cream  because it was the only thing that did not irritate my skin  and a small tub of that is $45. I m very happy with this product and am also very happy to be saving a lot of money. It is also much more affordable than any prescription lotion  cream or ointment.  This cream is non-greasy and non-irritating. Wonderful for my sensitive skin.

In California I could get away with minimal lotion because of the humidity  but now I cannot drench my body enough. I tried baby oil  cetaphil  and coconut oil. Within an hour  my skin was cracked  itched  and hurt because it was so dry. In desperation I called my dermatologist and she recommended CeraVe. It was the best call I made. I immediately ran to CVS and bought two tubs. My fiance and I drench our body in the cream  felt instant relief  and by the next morning we saw and felt and a huge change. If you have dry  cracked  itchy  painful  and irritated skin because of dry weather please try this amazing cream. You will NOT be disappointed.

3204,KLW,0,20-Jun-12,5 people found this helpful,My son has atopic dermatitis and he just recently went to the dermatologist. The dermatologist prescribed a steroid cream and then recommended we buy Cerave...for his eczma. The reason I was reading the reviews was because I don t feel this product is beneficial for his skin and wanted to see if other people had a problem with it drying skin out. Another doctor has told me that you should never put anything on sensitive or eczema prone skin that the ingredients start with water or alcohol....so I was shocked to see this dermatologist got us to buy a cream that has those two things first in its ingredients.  I believe it may help some people  but everyone s skin is different  what works for one person doesn t work for another so keep that in mind when buying this product.
3205,Messi,1,11-Oct-13,3 people found this helpful,It is really hydrating on my face. I have dry skin around my mouth and cheek area  but never really used expensive lotion before.

Also cream formula is more moisturizing than lotion so it s more bang for the buck

3214,Innovation Creator,1,22-Dec-10,30 people found this helpful,I am a chemical engineer. I used to formulate soaps and lotions in my spare time for fun. My aim was to make a truly moisturizing lotion. So  studying ingredients and selecting formulations was a large part of what I did. I wasn t mass producing  so skimping on ingredients was not important. My goal was just to create a product that brings and holds -moisture- to my dry skin. (Some just feel good; others like Oil of Olay just seem runny and are ineffective for me). So  I formulated my lotions to hold moisture to the skin. The result? My lotions not only keep my skin moist but also helped to minimize wrinkles.  Cerave was something I had never heard of. But  I was not in the lotion making business anymore. And  my fav cream had been discontinued. So  I researched the feedback here. Then  I bought it  studied it  and tried it. Cost wise  it seems to be expensive. Yes  it s a large jar but still it is more that what I normally pay. But  looking at the ingredients  I see why. Quality ingredients. Very similar to the premium stuff that I used when I made my own lotions.  Then  I tried it. It is super! At night  I apply it over areas of my face that will stretch when I move to prevent wrinkles. It absorbs fast. By morning  my skin is smooth. No breakouts. I also use it under make-up. It keeps my skin from drying out over the winter. I was really worried about finding a product to protect my skin from wrinkles without causing breakouts. This absolutely is it for me. Same results on my hands - they look less dry and less wrinkled when I remember to use it. And  I put it in a small jar while I am traveling to keep that same great care going - even if I end up having to use the hotel soap.  Very impressive product!

3222,3jaysmom,1,09-Jul-10,45 people found this helpful,I have had very dry skin and keratosis pilaris scince I was a child  and have tried everything from different creams from the dermatologist smearing myself in vaseline  to rubbing the backs of my arms with apple cider vinegar (got rid of the bumps  but SMELLY!) I had settled on a cetaphil-day  lac-hydrin-night combo  it kept my skin smooth but left me as red as a tomato  and the lac hydrin left me feeling sticky  like it never fully dried. I also had to remoisturize several times a day. If I didn t use lotion after washing my hands (every single time)my hands would crack and my cuticles would split almost instantly. My heels were rough and cracked  and no matter what I used  (pedi egg  heel miracle  burts bees)they would never heal.  After getting a terrible sunburn from using lachydrin during the day  I decided to look for a new lotion  and the reviews on this seemed like it was worth a try. It is the best! After using it twice a day for only 2 days  my heels feel like they are made of skin again  not rocks covered in sandpaper! My hands feel moisturized throughout the day  even if I don t use lotion immediately after washing them. I find that it is too heavy-feeling for my face  but if you use a small amount  it can be used on arms and legs  as it spreads quite easily despite its thick consistency. It is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used. Worth double the price  however they sell it two dollars cheaper at wallmart and wallgreens.

3232,Morgan,0,09-Jul-13,18 people found this helpful,I used this for years and liked it - I didn t compare it to many other moisturizers  but I am prone to eczema/psoriasis  especially on my elbows and knees  and it seemed to help me keep it at bay. But when the Environmental Working Group made their SkinDeep database of cosmetics available online  I went through my cabinets and looked up everything I owned  and boy was I surprised! I found that this contained propylparaben - linked to  Developmental/reproductive toxicity  Ecotoxicology  Endocrine disruption  Allergies/immunotoxicity  - as well as petrolatum ( Contamination concerns (PAHS)  Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive) )  methylparaben ( Biochemical or cellular level changes  Endocrine disruption  Allergies/immunotoxicity )  dimethicone ( Ecotoxicology  Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive) )  and more. I switched to some of the moisturizers that scored much better and never looked back. While the EWG s results are not the end-all  be-all (for example  I still use tar shampoo to try to control dandruff  even though that s listed as pretty toxic because of the - wait for it - tar in it)  there s so little oversight of the cosmetics industry that I really support the availability of at least *some* data for helping us finding products that don t have harmful chemicals.

3236,R.,1,17-Jan-10,26 people found this helpful,I have pretty bad eczema  and this winter I ve been using a prescription cream followed by CeraVe on my hands at night - I wear cotton gloves to bed  and after a few days my hands started to look and feel almost like a normal person s. It s been kind of life-changing - I can actually squeeze a lemon with my bare hands without being in terrible pain from broken skin. Chopping garlic? No problem! Cleaning the bathtub without rubber gloves? Bring it on! (These things may not sound like such a big deal to people without eczema..) This product absorbs so quickly that I was initially skeptical about its ability to do anything. In general I find that most moisturizers are either too watery  so they feel nice at first but then evaporate and lose effectiveness  or too oily  so they might help over the long term but don t make my skin feel any better when I first put them on. CeraVe is one of the only moisturizers I ve found that strikes a perfect balance - it doesn t make my skin feel oily or itchy after application  but my skin still feels soft and protected up to 12 hours later.  My one caveat is that it s so non-greasy that it feels a little unsatisfying - my skin problems meant that I spent pretty much my entire childhood slathered with Vaseline  and I ve realized that I actually find being covered in a thick  sticky  oily cream kind of comforting. But that s neither here nor there; this cream really works.  I think there is something to this whole ceramide thing - I like CeraVe a lot more than Eucerin  Neutrogena Norwegian Formula  Aquaphor  and other comparable products. TriCeram (tried to insert product link but it doesn t seem to be sold on Amazon anymore) works really well too  but not necessarily better than CeraVe. Also  it smells kind of funny and is really expensive.

Every other moisturizing product leaves my skin irritated and red.
3241,Kimberly,1,21-Oct-11,12 people found this helpful,My daughter has had issues with her skin since birth: cradle cap  red spots  skin felt like sand paper. In the last month  she developed red spots in the crooks of her arms and legs. We tried switching what we bathed her with twice or maybe three times and then switched from baby lotion and oil to Cetaphil  which helped some. But then one day last week I noticed the redness in the crooks of her legs had increased tenfold and was now oozing!!  Needless to say  as a first-time mother I was horrified and very worried. I made an emergency pediatrician appointment for her for the next day  but in the meantime did my own Internet research only to discover that my daughter has weeping/oozing eczema. I had used Cerave years ago when I moved to Michigan from Florida. Michigan winters were surely a shock to my skin. I remembered how well it worked and went straight to Walmart to look for it and slathered it on my daughter overnight.  By her 3:00 appointment the next day  the oozing had completely stopped and there was only the slightest redness. The doctor agreed with my diagnosis and prescribed two steriod creams (which really should be avoided in babies/children because steriods cause skin thinning and can cause stunted growth in high amounts). So I only use the steriod cream on occasion instead of twice daily as prescribed and instead use Cerave.  I m also bathing her with Dove bar soap and looking for Alpha Keri oil to seal in the moisture after baths hoping that this combination with keep the need for the steroid cream to a minimum. So far  so good. Her skin now feels like a baby s should after only one week with no redness or slight redness when before it was as red as a tomato and oozing! I really need to stock up on this stuff. Like someone else said  it s cheaper at Walmart. As much as I love Amazon  I ll be getting it from there since here it s around $16.
3242,Stephanie,0,24-Feb-12,11 people found this helpful,I heard great things about this product and  because my eczema was getting progressively worse  I would try just about anything anyone recommended to me.  Unfortunately  this product seemed to dry out my skin even more so that it had been over the course of about two weeks! I have also tried CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion AM with SPF  and that seemed to do even more damage; within a couple of days  I began desperately trying to find a new moisturizer... to no avail :(  I feel like every moisturizer I have tried has either dried my skin out more or made me itchy  and CeraVe seemed to do BOTH....  And the search continues...

After 1st night time application  however  my skin broke out in tiny whitish or clear bumps all over my face. Maybe they would have gone away over time but I m not one to try that sort of thing out :). Yet  now my husband uses it every night and loves it; So  I m sure it works for some.

3262,Freedom,1,05-Sep-13,101 people found this helpful,First of all I have Ichthyosis; specifically Epidermolytic Hyperkeratosis. One of the worst genetic skin disorders out there. I wouldn t wish this on my worst enemy. My skin is SUPER sensitive  very red  extremely dry  my skin sheds like crazy  it cracks and bleeds in the winter  I can t sweat so i m at high risk for heat strokes.  I have tried countless products that I have lost count years ago. When my dermatologists recommend a new lotion or cream i m usually skeptical put I decided to try CeraVe. and after two weeks i m very impressed. My skin is significantly less scaly  red and dry. It leaves my skin silky smooth.  I have used Amlactin  Keri  Eucerin  Vanicream Etc and they all just make my condition worse.  I m currently using their new renewing SA cream version of this original cream and so far so good!  I put this on after the shower and it keeps the dryness away all day!  After adopting this cream into my regimen my skin is the best it has EVER been. Its smooth  clear and less red. Sometimes it looks like I don t have ichthyosis.

3265,Amazon Customer,1,02-Aug-09,51 people found this helpful,I normally do not write reviews but this product helped me so much that I really want to help others. I spent $30. for a copay to see a Dermatologist about this eczema  flaky dried skin and redness on my forehead and $65 on some ridiculous cream (doctor prescribed) that did not work. What a waste  told my sister she said her whole family uses this cream and it worked for them on eczema  cracked skin  dry areas  etc. So I tried it not expecting that much. WOW!!! First I spent a ton of money on aloe creams Cetaphil soap  Cetaphil moisturizer and Cetaphil cream plus others. I spent close to $200  total waste of time and money on all the soaps and creams. The Cetaphil cream was kind of greasy but not as bad as others. But this product is a miracle!!! No Joke! Only $15 at walgreens or cvs and cheaper if your not in a hurry from Amazon. Worth every penny! The jar is a one pound jar you can choke a horse with all this cream  just put it on very lightly and it will not be greasy  again use lightly can always add more. Cleared up my forehead in days. This is incredible  cheap and works. You can t ask for more. I try to use it twice a day morning and night. No more staring from people. Thanks for a great product!!!
3266,A.E. Babbs,1,17-May-16,1 058 people found this helpful,Skin care is a very personal thing  so you can see details on my skin type  concerns  etc.  at the bottom of this review. All products mentioned will also be linked below so you can do an easy comparison based on your needs.  Overview/ intended use/ claims/ packaging/ actual results:  CeraVe Cream: intended for normal to dry skin. Comes in a large tub (16 oz) or in a smaller 1.86oz (56mL) tube. Contains hyaluronic acid. Thicker consistency similar to a body butter. Non-scented. I recommend scooping a small amount of this product into another smaller container. Since it’s such a large amount if you purchase the tub  you don’t want to continue dipping your hands into the product over the 6+months it would take to use up?particularly if you’re prone to breakouts. There is a version that has a pump in the lid as well  but I don’t have personal experience with that version.  CeraVe Lotion: Comes in a 12 oz bottle with a pump. Intended for normal to dry skin  but is really more toward normal or oily. I have combination skin that is much dryer in the winter  and this isn’t as hydrating as I need during those months. My husband has dry skin and can’t use this product at all. This is mainly a summer lotion for me. It contains hyaluronic acid and isn’t scented. I’ve used this on my body and face  but it’s mainly a summer facial lotion for me. Pretty much the same product as the CeraVe PM  but cheaper than the product marketed as specific for facial use.  CeraVe SA Lotion: This is a miracle product for me. It comes in an 8 oz (237mL) bottle with a pump dispenser. It’s not scented and contained salicylic acid as the main active ingredient. It is the same constancy as most pump style lotions and soaks in quickly. Intended for dry  rough  bumpy skin. I use this product on my face when I’m having blemish issues or my skin looks a little dull. I also use this on the backs of my arms to keep them smooth and soft.  CeraVe AM: Comes in a 3oz (89mL) bottle with a pump dispense (basically the same packaging as the PM lotion). This is intended for daytime use. Contains SPF 30 (zinc oxide  octinoxate  octocrylene)  hyaluronic acid  and it lacks fragrance. I had a bad reaction to this product  I’m assuming because of the addition of sunscreen. I used it three times and was left with red bumps and inflamed skin  so I discontinued use. It will not be included in the rest of this review as I didn t use it more than a few time before giving it to a friend.  CeraVe PM: Comes in a 3 oz (89mL) bottle with a pump dispenser. Contains hyaluronic acid. Intended for normal to dry skin  and specific for facial moisturizing. This product is essentially the same as the CeraVe Lotion  but the specificity for facial use means it’s more expensive and dispenses a smaller amount of product. I finished the lotion above  and still had this. Once this is empty I’m just going to purchase the CeraVe lotion instead as I can’t tell any difference between the products  other than packaging and the amount dispensed with a single pump (due to packaging again).  Comparison of thickness/ hydration (see attached photos):  CeraVe Cream: You can see from the photos that it’s a much thicker  creamer product than the  Lotion  products produced by this brand. It absorbs within a few minutes and doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy. If you re familiar with other  cream  products  this would be similar to a body butter and is the right most lotion on my hand in the comparison.  CeraVe SA Lotion (and other  Lotions  from this brand): They have a more liquid/translucent consistency you typically associate with a pump based lotion. This is the same consistency as the  CeraVe Lotion  which also came in a pump (not pictured as I didn’t repurchase when empty). It sinks in more quickly than the cream  as it’s thinner. It also doesn’t leave your skin feeling greasy or filmy afterward. This is the middle lotion in the photo comparison. Note that it s very slightly thicker than the PM lotion  which is the it s left.  CeraVe PM: This is a nighttime treatment cream I use mainly in the summer months or when my skin acts up in the winter. To me  it’s a version of the  Lotion  thickness and after using up this product I’ll return to the normal size (and much cheaper) full size Moisturizing Lotion. I can’t see any difference between those two products  though you can tell in the photo this is a more translucent and a slight amount thinner than the SA Lotion. This is the left most lotion on my hand in the photo comparison.  How I Use These Products:  Warmer Weather: I use the Moisturizing Cream on my body. If I’m not having skin problems I use the PM lotion or the Moisturizing Lotion on my face. If I am having a few problem areas or I notice my skin looks dull or the backs of my arms are bumpy  I switch over to the SA lotion  typically at night. I use the products in the morning and at night. When I’m going to be in the sun for an extended period of time I use an additional daytime lotion from a different brand that contains sunscreen  as I had a reaction to the one from this line.  Cooler Weather: I use the same routine as above  but eliminate the Moisturizing Lotion or PM Lotion  and use the Moisturizing Cream for my face and body. I substitute as indicated above.  Photo Legend:  Photo 1: the products I use regularly. It also includes photos of the containers I use to depot smaller amounts of the CeraVe Cream Photo 2: What the product looks like in the jar Photo 3: The consistency of the product. You can see how thick it is here. Photo 4: A close up of the different styles of packaging Photo 5: A comparison of texture of the different products mentioned above. Left is the PM lotion  Middle is the SA Lotion  Right is the Cream. Photo 6: The comparison in transparency and thickness of the different products Photo 7: The container I put the SA lotion in for travel. You can see how to grip the container in this picture in order to open in.  My Skin Type: I m in my early 30s  but have been using these products since my late 20s at the recommendation of my dermatologist. I have combination skin  that s sensitive and prone to breakouts. My skin is dryer in the winter months than summer  so I cycle these products during different times of the year depending on my skincare needs.  Products Mentioned CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion  12 oz.

3267,P. B. Panagore,1,30-Nov-17,66 people found this helpful,I work in broadcast TV in a regional New England market and wear makeup frequently. Under my makeup  I ve used CeraVe for years. It never leaves my face feeling sticky or heavy. It sinks in well and leaves a barrier protecting my face from the makeup  plus it helps by making makeup removal easier. This is the first tub I bought. I usually owned a tube. It s a good deal. The photo I added is of me in my home TV production studio proving with my smile that I like this product. I ll be putting some on soon for today s in-studio shoot.
3268,D. A. Vargas,1,23-Feb-18,6 people found this helpful,My son was two months old when he developed eczema all over his face  arms  shoulders & legs. I had to use a cortisone cream & Aquaphor ointment to treat his eczema  it worked well but finding a cream to keep his skin moisturized was definitely a huge challenge. I used raw unrefined coconut oil for the meantime to moisturize his skin  although not very ideal for a two month old as you can imagine getting oil on his clothes  his sheets and anyone who held him. It was very stressful and heart breaking trying different creams and lotions only to make his eczema flare up again and again. It took about two months to finally find this life saver right here! My son is now 2 1/2 and has been using this CeraVe cream ever since. Of course with eczema there’s a lot variables that play a role in keeping his eczema under control. But this CeraVe Cream has been a huge help along the way! No flare ups or patchy skin! Yay! P.S I recently started using this cream on my face and body and oh my gosh  it’s fantastic! My face and body feels so soft!! I wish I used it sooner lol!

3271,Julie,1,01-Jun-17,5 people found this helpful,This is the only lotion I have found that actually 1) absorbs in  2) softens the soles of my feet  and 3) improves the condition of my skin. Just one use helps the appearance and sensitivity of peeling skin  and a few weeks of use really softened my feet. No more cracked  bleeding skin. Plus I can walk around barefoot after applying  without feeling oily or like I am slipping around!  I can finally stop my lotion search - Recommend this 100%!  Note: I have erythromelalgia  and my feet are very abused. Neuropathy  edema  discoloration  hives  blisters  chilblains  abscesses  peeling  cracking  bleeding  you name it. Add to that painful hot flares and over an hour of soaking in cool water every day  and it makes for some difficult-to-manage skin!
3272,Cat,1,26-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,I purchased this at the recommendation of my dermatologist. I have really dry skin from a culmination of aging (65)  living on the East Coast where we live in our heated homes most of the winter  and years of boating/sunning. I whined to my dermatologist that no lotion seems to work. She told me lotions are too light and I needed a cream and suggested this. She said I could also use it on my face. It does work really well. For a heavy cream  it doesn t leave a greasy residue. I m not a happy camper having to slather it on after each shower  but I ve accepted the fact that it s an evil necessity at this point in my life. I had some small bumps on my back (which she said was caused by dry skin) and it really helps. My only problem at this point is that I need it in a gallon bucket  and it s not cheap! But I guess you get what you pay for. It s an excellent product!
3273,Shannen S,1,03-Apr-19, ,Not only is this more affordable than other products I’ve tried  but this lotion works magic on my skin! I have had problem skin ever since I hit puberty and I’m 27 now and it’s still a battle. I’ve tried so many different products and lotions. The thing with me is that I HATE lotion. I hate the greasy stain it leaves on my skin. It’s almost as if it just never soaks in. I decided to try this product on a whim and now I can say I have found the lotion for me! It soaks in and dries so fast which is amazing for me. It’s more of a creamy texture than a sticky  greasy lotion. I’ve been using it for maybe a month now and I noticed the other day that my skin is completely clear and so soft. No more of those little bump things on my forehead or my chin. I use neutrogyna hydro boost facial cleanser if anyone is wonder. That is reasonably affordable and has lasted me months and I still have half the bottle left. The hydo boost lotion however costs more than this lotion and is 1/10 the size. I just couldn’t keep affording that so I tried this. I wish I could give this 1 000 stars. My skin has always been a problem  combination of so oily I could cook a meal with the damn grease and so dry it’ll flake right off my face. For the first time in my life though  with this product  I am FINALLY seeing results and I now have soft  clear  hydrated skin that just feels fantastic as well. I couldn’t be happier with this product. I will be a forever customer.
3274,HerdACD,0,21-Apr-19,3 people found this helpful,I wish that I had read the ingredients before I bought this product. The first ingredient is Water. There is also alcohol in the formula. As you can imagine  once this moisturizer is applied to cracked skin  the effects are agonizing. I am disappointed that there are so many chemicals in this product when there are so many excellent natural alternatives.
3275,Denise H.,1,30-Sep-15,7 people found this helpful,I ve been using Cerave for a few years now per my dermatologist s recommendation. I started having skin allergies a few years ago and was sensitive to lotions with perfume ingredients. This moisturizing cream is thicker than lotion and it does a great job of hydrating your skin and keeping it healthy. When I became pregnant  I used it even more on my stomach  not necessarily to prevent stretch marks (since they are hereditary)  but to ensure that my skin remain hydrated. As my baby grew and my skin stretched or became itchy  this cream kept my skin from drying out and put an end to the itchiness. I can t speak to whether it prevents stretch marks  but for me  using it daily kept my skin healthy and free from stretch marks.
3276,Trisha Wilson,1,17-Jun-19, ,Really enjoying this moisturizer since purchasing it. I have sensitive  dry  acne prone skin so I have to be careful with what I use as one product that could help my dry skin would make me break out. I haven t had that issue with this moisturizer and for that i m thankful. It keeps my skin hydrated  but to boost up hydrating I had some squalene oil on top of my moisturizer by just patting a little on. But i m sure even if I didn t use the oil this product would keep my skin feeling moisturized. My only complaint is that I wish it came with a pump. I understand it s for the body and the face but I use mine strictly for my face. I hate dipping my finder in the product to get out what I need. My hands are always clean by the time I get to this step as a moisturize and tone before hand. But I always worry about cross contamination as I don t want any bacteria or other oils on my face that will cause me to break out. But that is my only complaint about this product.  I rated the  scent  category for this review as 1 star as it doesn t have a scent. I thought that was a weird rating feature to have for this product and didn t know how to rate it.

3279,George,1,13-Mar-18,3 people found this helpful,I bought this because I fell in love with the CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion in the 12 oz pump applicator. I was so impressed by this stuff. I am a guy and I usually don t go for this  moisturizing lotion to keep your skin feeling nice and healthy  type stuff  but this lotion is incredible and does not leave your skin oily and/gross. It is actually absorbed by your skin in less than a minute I am awesomely stunned by the quality of this product. Absolutely Incredible!
3280,CBE His Majesty,0,13-Jul-17,5 people found this helpful,I hate this cream  my skin is dry and this moisturizer makes it greasy to the point where my face is shinning in 100 degree weather. Also it stays on so one has to wash their face off to remove it. I discarded it absolutely horrendous cream. I love the cerave face wash and i thought to give their other product a try but regretted and wasted 12$.
3281,Caroline,0,11-Sep-18,3 people found this helpful,This cream was purchased with the intention of replacing the more expensive cetaphil body cream that my wife uses. We both tried this cream out and agreed that it was no replacement and not only that was so sticky feeling that we decided to just throw it away as it didn t make us feel moisturized or smooth. Terrible product imo.
3282,Sandra Z.,0,19-Nov-18,3 people found this helpful,I bought this cream for the dry flakey skin I was started to get in the winter....OMG....when I put it on it felt like a chemical burn on my face..... this is supposed to be fine the face?! Please stay away especially if you have sensitive skin! Definitely NOT meant for the face. I wanted to love this but this is wayyyyy too harsh and NOT soothing at all
3283,Saline The Salt Lake Queen,1,30-Nov-15,18 people found this helpful,I have chronically dry  eczematic skin. Just about every drugstore lotion makes me break out after extended use.  Cerave is gentle and nourishing. In the shower  I apply a carrier oil (usually jojoba or coconut oil) to wet skin and then two pumps of Cerave all over my body before air-drying. With repeated use  I ve gone from cracked  scaly skin with sore oozing patches to skin as smooth as a baby s butt. Seriously. Love this stuff.  This stuff can burn a little bit if you apply it to irritated or dry skin. The trick is to apply it WET and keep using it to rebuild your skin s protective barrier.
3284,Love2Swim,1,23-Jan-19, ,After reading about CeraVe on line  I purchased this product at the recommendation of a friend who is a nurse practitioner. My arms had broken out in eczema blisters as a result of an allergic reaction. The itching and the ugliness of the site was extremely upsetting. I swim regularly in an indoor pool. The chlorine is terribly drying and irritating  and it was making the eczema worse. After trying various moisturizers  I went on line in exasperation and found that CeraVe is highly recommended by dermatologists especially for eczema. After my friend s confirmation of what I had read  I purchased a tub of CeraVe  and the itching was relieved immediately. The blisters began to disappear and eventually my arms were totally clear. I have continued to use it as a body moisturizer  finding that it is long lasting  totally non-greasy  light and pleasantly refreshing. I even discontinued my more expensive facial moisturizer and am now using CeraVe under my make-up. With three ceramides as well as hyaluronic acid  it is the bomb! Will never be without CeraVe again.
3285,Luna s Mom,1,12-Jan-19,2 people found this helpful,I have a LOT of problems with scents due to allergy issues and I was so pleasantly surprised to find that this has no scents in it. A lot of lotions say  scent free  but always seem to have scent anyway. This one does not. I m not sure if I would use it in the summer  as it has a slight oitment-like texture to it  but for in the winter when the cold has your skin chapped and dry? This stuff is amazing.
3286,Kindle CustomerRosieM,1,13-Apr-19, ,I bought CeraVe for myself a while back and it honestly does a wonderful job moisturizing this poor body of mine. Recently  the skin on my face was peeling  Just over dry I guess. I tried different skin creams and serums  I would still have the redness of my forehead. Out of sheer desperation  I tried a tiny amount on the poor face and honestly  it was like magic  it seems CeraVe was just sucked in to my skin. The red spots (me rubbing my forehead) disappeared within hours. Now my daughter in Minnesota was complaining of dry skin and I ordered this size for her and she just loves it. I explained to her that having a pump up system is really important keeping the cream  healthy  rather than digging your fingers in the jars. Don t understand why more manufacturer don t do this. But I miss the lack of subtle fragrance. A girl like to feel like a girl.
3287,A. Hawley,1,17-Apr-17,5 people found this helpful,This was recommended to me by my dermatologist as a way to keep my face moisturized during the day while we figure out what s causing my rosacea. I m not a dainty little froo-froo guy  I don t like smelling fruity  and don t want to feel like I ve got gloop on my face all day. I really like the CeraVe product and will continue to buy it.
3288,Megan Darling,1,31-Mar-19, ,I don’t have any  before  pictures  so I have no physical proof to show that this stuff works miracles. I was so desperate for a solution for my face... I had hormonal pimples all over my lower cheeks & jawline  yet my skin is always dry and it’s super sensitive and I deal with random flares of eczema. So I was trying a million different products  sometimes separately and sometimes together in a regimen  trying to find out what could work. I bought so many products based on people’s amazing reviews and incredible before/after pictures and everything (soaps  serums  lotions  etc.) made my skin so much worse. My breakouts would get more intense  my skin would get oily instead of moisturized  and my skin started burning with one of the products.  So I would just cry (from both pain and embarrassment over my skin) and then go back to the internet to find the next thing I could try. When I saw this  I had the same  well everyone says it works and these people look great in their after shots  thought process  so I gave it a go. And finally my skin started clearing up and felt properly moisturized. And then I started crying from happiness because I realized I could finally look in the mirror without feeling like utter crap.  TL;DR - I cried a lot because my skin was so terrible. I tried so many different things that people had good results with and it made my skin worse. This cured my face and I’m gonna use it ‘til I die.
3289,Joy,1,09-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,I really like this a whole lot. It is so smooth and does not leave a sticky substance when you put it on your skin. It drinks in the skin super fast and has really helped with my very dry skin from chemo. The downside is you have to stick you hands into the tub to get out the lotion. Its thick so maybe they don t want it in a pump but it would be nice to have it that way so your not possibly contaminating the whole tub overtime you dip in to use it. But I just make sure my hands are nice and clean and it should be fine. Highly recommend this and will definitely be buying it again.
3290,Paula Renee,1,27-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,Recommended by our dermatologist after going to three dermatologists for recommendations and second opinions. My two year old has had ezcema and skin issues since she was born. I was told to avoid anything with wool and lanolin as they are irritants. Dont use any laundry detergent but free and clear. Bathe 1-2 times daily and apply this immediately after  and it worked! Her skin is finally healing and feels so much better. I even use this on my face!
3291,Nicole,1,11-Jun-19, ,About 5 years ago I completely revamped my skincare routine and started using CeraVe products  and they have made such a difference for me. I never regularly used a moisturizer before trying CeraVe moisturizing cream  and the difference this has made in my skin is phenomenal. I only use the cream at nighttime and use a tinted moisturizer with SPF in the morning  so this tub lasts a really long time for me. A little cream goes a long way! The cream is rich and thick but absorbs quickly and doesn t feel greasy at all. It leaves skin feeling soft and supple and moisturized.  I prefer to use the tub with the pump to prevent contamination from dipping my fingers directly into the tub  but once it gets to the end the pump won t reach what s left at the bottom so that is the only way to get it out.
3292,Desperado,1,02-Jul-18,2 people found this helpful,This is the best  lotion  ever. It is very  very thick  not greasy and just makes my skin feel more moisturized than anything I have ever used.... And I have tried a LOT of lotions. You simply can t beat this for moisturizing your skin. I put it on my hands every night before bed and sometimes my feet in the summer. It has excellent staying power. The next morning when I shower  I can still feel it on my legs and feet.
3293,Kristen A Spohr,1,19-Feb-19,One person found this helpful,I cannot say how much money I have spent on reasonable and very expensive creams for my four year old’s eczema. He used to scratch himself until he bled at times. CeraVe was right under my nose the whole time  and for whatever reason I had yet to try it. I now slather it on him daily  and have for a couple of months. His skin is now soft and moisterized and how I wish i had just started with this a couple of years ago. I know eczema is tricky  and one cream may work for someone and not someone else  but this worked beautifully.
3294,Rachel F. Lee,1,01-Mar-19, ,I adore this moisturizer! I m 28 and have had acne since I was around 10  and for the first time I can see my skin clearing up! I had been using only water on my skin for years  as everything else seemed to just make my acne worse  until I decided to get serious about my skin care again. This moisturizer in conjunction with the Vanicream gentle facial cleanser  good old stridex alternated with a glycolic acid toner  and aquaphor in my extra dry spots  has done an amazing job of healing my acne so quickly! If you have dry skin and acne this moisturizer will be your best friend! I also use it as a body moisturizer and on my feet layered with aquaphor on top  it s just wonderful!
3295,Nanners,1,07-Sep-16,79 people found this helpful,Update. Its now almost May 2017 and I ve used up my cetaphil but still have half tub cerave. I m now using a different moisturizer for my face. For some reason I m not a fan of ceraVe.  I m going to review two products. I give both 5 stars.  Bit about me  I m nearing my 40 s  dry to normal skin  live in Wisconsin where the winters dry out my skin and summers make it normal.  CeraVe: moisturizing cream (normal to dry) my first tub. When you open this product it looks shiny & slimy (at least to me). When applying it feels very tacky  doesn t go on smoothly and I feel I have to use more product (compared to cetaphil) It drys very fast and you can t even tell you put it on. Skin is well moisturized with no lotion feel to it. I like to use this on my face under makeup and under my fake tanner. It works great! My skin feels well moisturized all day long with this product.  Cetaphil: moisturizing cream (dry & sensitive skin) my second tub. When you open this you can tell it s very very thick & creamy. The texture is creamy & greasy. A little bit will go a long way. When applying it s easy to keep spreading it. It gives my skin a glow to it. I love how it looks on my body. This has been my go to summer moisturizer. It gives that dewy look. I do feel my makeup will not last as long but I still like to use it on my face. I ran out of this in spring and got CeraVe but felt like something was missing. I m on my second tub now.  I can see pros and cons to both. A manly man may not like cetaphil (or maybe) or you may not like the slight greasy feel of it well working with hands or outdoors. With my dry skin I love it. It makes your skin look healthy & glowing. A little goes a long way.
3296,Cbreeze,1,08-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,Why has it taken me so long to find this stuff! It s not greasy and keeps your skin SO soft!! I have crocodile skin and it looks scaly after an hour of putting lotion on. BUT THIS STUFF!!! I put it on one night  showered the next morning  and didn t have to put on more!! My legs didn t look scaly  they looked soft and silky! I now use this as my daily moisturizer on my face too; before bed after washing and mix a little with my cc cream in the morning. My skin glows! I love it and will not buy another lotion/moisturizer cream.
3297,Michelle Yates,1,24-May-19,One person found this helpful,I had no idea the difference between cream and lotion until my dermatologist explained it to me. I started using this CeraVe moisturizing cream nightly and it has made a tremendous difference in skin hydration. My complexion is better and my face is not peeling like it was before  using regular unscented face lotion. Lotion is mostly made up of water  you would think that would help hydrate/moisturize  but no  not so much! Who knew!
3298,Christine s Reviews,1,25-Jan-19, ,Review from someone who hates lotion. So far I ve used this for a few days. I do not like lotion  hate the feeling of it entirely. This cream dries nice  no greasy feeling. I ve used it on my face and body. Was nervous about how it would feel on my face since I am very sensitive  so far so good. Dry patches are healing if at all even there. I will continue to use. Large jar. Small amount goes a long way. I use it right out of the shower after I dry off and then on my face after I wash and go to bed. Like it so far and coming from me that s a big deal since I hate having anything on my face and I hate that greasy look.
3299,Thomas McCoy,0,07-Feb-18,6 people found this helpful,I broke out with red  itchy bumps after a couple days use. Must contain an ingredient that some people are allergic to.
3300,Sandy,1,20-Dec-18, ,I’ve never owned a moisturizing cream that has worked this well. I have pretty sensitive skin and I don’t have an issue with feeling like it’s burning a my face. I used to apply some face lotion and feel dried out within the hour  this stuff though pulls off moisturizing your face without making it feel heavy and sticky and my skin just overall feels great all day. This container will also last a century with how little lotion is needed for your face daily and just how much you get per container. Even have my husband using it now to help me make a dent in it (plus during winter our skin really needs help).
3301,Courtney Marshall,0,07-Mar-18,2 people found this helpful,I am a fan of this lotion and my review isn t so much about the product itself my issue was I just received this last night and when I got this there was no plastic safety seal on the outside nor was there anything covering the lotion itself inside the bottle. It seems like there should have been some kind of barrier after I took the lid off to protect the lotion. I m worried to use it because of this issue. Anyone else received this lotion with no safety seal or anything it just seems unsanitary that anyone could have opened this and touched the lotion.
3302,Michelle,1,03-Jun-19, ,My skin has not felt like this since I was in my 20 s  and I am in my late 50 s. I have never had a cream I could successfully use on my face and body  but this is it! I am so amazed  and I wonder how I did not know about this product before. Also  I have sensitive skin and CeraVe is perfect  no scent  perfect moisture  and not crazy expensive. I can tell the jar I purchased will last awhile because a little goes a long way  while providing moisturizing that really lasts. Color me thoroughly impressed and completely thrilled.
3303,Tara Montes,1,12-Apr-19, ,We bought this for our daughter who has eczema. She decided she didn’t like it before she even started using it. I figured I use it since I have a mild case myself. Well  I will never use another type of lotion again. I love this stuff. I thought it was going to leave a heavy waxy feel after it was applied but boy was I wrong. It absorbs leaving a soft feel to my legs and arms. I can even go a day without applying it and my legs still feel amazing. I started using their other products too. Worth the price you spend.
3304,Robin P.,1,12-Sep-16,10 people found this helpful,I just received this today and I must say  this jar is HUGE (see photo s) So you definitely get your moneys worth  this jar is going to last quite a while. My dermatologist recommended this and I hope that it will help with my annoying skin that feels like I can never get enough moisture although I also have acne. I put some on when it arrived earlier today and so far  my face still feels soft  not dry like it normally would feel by this time of day. This CREAM is really THICK  unlike the lotion  so if you don t like thick  you may not like this. I m going to try the lotion as well  as I have read really good reviews about how well it absorbs into your skin. So I might alternate between the two  according to how dry my skin feels. Hope this helps.
3305,Amazon Customer,1,04-May-19, ,Just a classic moisturizer you can’t go wrong with. I have a 10 step skincare routine (k beauty) and this is my last step to seal everything in. It does the job and really works. It also has the essential 3 things a cream needs to help rebuild a compromised moisture barrier form over exfoliating or any irritants. It has ceramides  fatty acids and cholesterol. All things a cream needs to have in order to actually he’ll rebuild a compromised moisture barrier. Or to help keep the moisture barrier healthy. I’ll definitely never be without this!
3306,Khoi D.,1,22-Jun-19, ,I have tried many and many lotion and cream over the years and this one is one of the best one I have tried. I prefer the cream over the Cerave lotion which does not stay on as long. It is definitely not the cheapest cream but it works very well. Only reason it gets a four stars is because of the scent. Because it does not have any fragrance  you can sometimes smell the chemical  very faint  not strong enough to bother me but it is there. Similar to the smell of cooking flour or baking soda.
3307,Amy Jo,1,08-May-19, ,I can t put any oil on my face or I break out like crazy. I learned this the hard way and tried everything to try to figure out what was making me have insane acne suddenly at 32. After I figured it out I ordered this stuff and my skin was instantly better and acne that I have been so upset and sad about is slowly going away with the help of some other products. Really helps plump up fine lines  in the short-term at least. I also love that it is so thick and there is so much- it s gonna last me a long time :0)
3308,yogagram,1,21-Apr-09,520 people found this helpful,At age 60 I have had severe atopic dermititis since I was about ten years old and have had the help of many caring health care providers over the years. I have tried numerous treatments to get relief - steroids (oral and creams)  anahistamines  moisturizers  Protopic and Elocon  elimination diets  supplements  moisturizing baths  detoxification  acupuncture  yoga  behavior modification  stress reduction meditation and light treatments at Mass General Hospital and Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. I have benefited  and still benefit from several of these treatments  but my skin is very scarred   and I had not found a moisturizer which really restored my skin to a more balanced state until I began using CeraVe about a year ago.  Cerave is probably the single most effective treatment I have found for reducing inflammation and strengthening the skin barrier. (And compared to other treatments I have had  what a bargain! ) I am not aware of any side effects. Skin improvement began the first week I used it. My skin is softer and more supple  ichthyosis and scaling are way down  redness has abated considerably (though not entirely)   and the horrible itching is a minor distraction now. I have had fewer outbreaks of staph infections  and - most remarkable - I look healthier and am comfortable most of the time. In addition I am more focused mentally  more rested  and less prone to depression .  These results are amazing given my history. I do need to use CeraVe at least twice daily to maintain its benefits  which seem to include immune system strengthening. And there is one frustrating area not responding very well to this treatment - my face ( not the area I would choose if I had to have one problem area). Overall though  with the itching way down  I am more relaxed and happier than I have been in years. I hope others with my condition will find this cream as as helpful.
3309,Allie,1,10-Jun-19, ,I have very sensitive skin and it s prone to drying out. I used this after getting an eczema breakout and it cleared it up within a matter of days. I ve also had allergic reactions to other products  and this soothed my irritated skin. Can t say enough good things about it. It s the only cream I will ever use. It s gentle and non-greasy feeling  works well under make-up  and just makes my skin feel like skin again. I live in a really dry climate so this stuff saves my life.
3310,JCKC,1,09-Dec-18, ,This is a great deal for the amount (19oz!!) of cream. My daughter suffered from severe eczema about 10 years ago and we tried almost all creams/over the counter hydro-cortisone that s out there available. This is the only one that worked for her that is not a steroid product. It is by far the best working moisturizer which gets absorbed completely  leaving your skin and hair grease free. We ve been using this cream since then  religiously. We applied this cream about 3 times a day back then  but her eczema eventually got better within a couple of years. Since her dry skin got better  she s been putting it on only after she takes a shower  just once daily. Great product  we highly recommend it to anyone.
3311,ROB,1,30-Apr-19, ,This cream is exactly what my sun damaged 50 year old mug needed. I have never used a moisturizing lotion before and rarely used sunscreen through a life time of surfing and all day beach days. When my face gets sun now  it flares up in red botches and then flakes and itches like crazy. So I got this and started using it about a month ago. It immediately stopped my flare ups and has rejuvenated my skin so much that I actually have a tan again and my skin looks younger too. I will keep this stuff on hand from now on!
3312,Ss Max,1,18-Feb-18, ,I have been using this cream in conjunction with CeraVe s PM lotion and have been very happy with this combo. The only reason I use the PM lotion is for the additional niacinamide which is not present in the cream. If not for this one missing ingredient  this would be all I would need for a nicely moisturized face morning and night.  I used to have a lengthy layering of anti-aging product routine... now I know  that isn t necessary for the same effects and less money spent.  Make sure your skin is still wet/moist when you apply this to avoid that thick lotion feeling on your skin. I happen to love that feeling  but I know some people really don t enjoy it.  This cream + sunblock = excellent anti-aging routine
3313,MinzInGeorgia,1,27-Jun-19, ,Love the CeraVe line of products and decided to add this body cream to my every day regime. My skin has not felt better and has an even texture and glow. I m older and have been experiencing little bumps on my skin around by upper arms and shoulders. The CeraVe with ceramides and hyaluronic acid have evened out my skin and given me a natural glow. My 30 year old son has started using the lotion to help with ingrown hairs on his neck and loves the results.

I have been using this lotion for about two weeks. When I first started using this I really did not think it was working. As the daily use went on the product was working better with each day. I am happy that I gave it a chance. I would order again but the one with the pump.
3316,Kch,1,04-Feb-17,2 people found this helpful,OK so this is the BOMB of Lotions. As a medical professional  I encourage all my patients use this and use it myself. All the dermatologist I talk to recommend it and use it their-selves. My son has and has had since birth the rough bumpy eczema on his upper arms.. Using CeraVE Moisturizing Cream- the cream has resolved this issue. Its scentless and i like smelly things so I add Tropicana After Sun lotion (coconut) in it with a little of my sunless tanner- for tint to make the best lotion Eva..
3317,Krista,1,21-Sep-18, ,Ok  so I ve used Cervu products for about 2 years. It was recommended after my dermabrasion sessions. For some reason  after a couple months I d always shop for something more expensive and made by like Sunday Riley  Organics  Drunk Elephant... Thinking that those products would do an even better job. I ALWAYS come back to this little miracle in a bottle. I guess because it s not expensive  doesn t have a model modeling it  I d assume it wasn t for long term care. Not true! I swear I m staying here from now on lol! This cream moisturizes my face so well and gives me a glowing appearance the next morning! I have SENSITIVE skin  and will break out with a lot of stuff! This does not clog my pores  help reduce adult acne and diminish fine lines  (hydrates well). If I had money at my disposal  I d use Sunday Riley... Too pricey to continue to use but works just as great!
3318,Stephanie,1,27-Nov-18, ,My children have been using this product for the past 4 years. My 4 year old has eczema at a very young age and this was the only product that would moisturize his skin enough without irritating it. We now use it for both our children and my husband has gotten on board. Its expensive but we have found it worth the price not to put ointments and creams on our kids skin. We have little to no breakouts on either child during any season of the year since we made it a staple in our daily regiment.
3319,Erin,1,30-May-17,3 people found this helpful,I have extremely sensitive skin. I have problems with eczema and orange peel skin. Using this  combined with Montana Emu Oil has made all of the difference for me. Everything turns my skin red  but this product does not cause a reaction on my skin whatsoever. I also run dry  and this provides enough moisture.
3320,tawny,1,08-Jan-16,2 people found this helpful,This my favorite moisturizer and it has the best ingredients out of all the creams/lotions I ve tried. It contains ceramides (a natural part of the skin that prevents moisture loss)  hyaluronic acid (also natural part of the skin  attracts and holds water)  and your standard dimethicone. I ve found it especially helpful for my eczema. It turns out that people with eczema are lack certain ceramides with their skin.  As for parabens  the scientific community agrees they re not an issue. While there was one study claiming a link between parabens and breast tumors  that study has been discredited because of poor desig (no control group) and shaky reasoning (parabens are not close enough to estrogen cause worry). Parabens are found in fruit and normal body tissues  too.  While it s not intended for the face  I sometimes use it for extra dry patches on my face. (Some people have broken out doing this  so do test it on a tiny area if you re thinking about it.) It absorbs quickly and doesn t leave a sticky film. However  a few of my makeup products don t mix well with the cream and will start to pill as I m applying it. This is something else that should be tested if you re thinking of using the cream on your face.
3321,Neka B.,1,23-Jun-17,6 people found this helpful,This moisturizer is the ONLY skin cream that doesn t trigger my eczema! I use this after my showers and in the morning after rinsing my face  and it makes my dry eczema skin so incredibly moisturized and happy. This product is so thick and creamy  but not so heavy that it won t rub into the skin. Also great for dry  cracked heals (add socks and wear overnight). When I m having an eczema episode this is the only thing that works to sooth the burning  itchy  dry skin. It causes NO irritation whatsoever  which is more than I can say for anything else I have used. Believe me when I say I ve tried them all!... coconut oil  olive oil  jojoba oil  coco butter  Cetaphil  Aveno  Neutrogena  Dove  and plenty more (including prescription formulas). After having a skin patch test done because of severe eczema outbreaks  I found out that (like many other eczema sufferers)  I am allergic to 2 things: cocamidopropyl betaine  and propylene glycol. Most sufferers don t even know they re allergic  but suffer the effects when using the most common soaps/lotions/ beauty products  never knowing. However  just TRY and avoid these 2 chemicals and you will soon see it is virtually impossible! The stuff is in nearly EVERYTHING sold - even baby washes and stuff labeled  gentle !!! Except for this wonderful  moisturizing cream. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants very moisturized skin without any irritation!

I mean like  not normal people dry  like desert rat dry. So I have tried EVERYTHING. And nothing worked like I had hoped  until my facial lady told me to try this. My skin has never felt this good! I love that it s not heavy and sticky  like others are  but instead makes your skin feel naturally moisturized. I loved it so much that I now also use the hydrating face wash  body wash  and moisturizer. They re all awesome  would highly recommend!
3323,Amazon Customer,1,25-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,This is my go-to moisturizer for my face and body. I would rate it five stars but I have to deduct a star seeing that months passed before I understood exactly how I needed to apply this to my face so I wouldn t get breakouts. This is an *excellent* body moisturizer  you can apply as much as you want without adverse effects. This is also excellent for the face but you need to experiment and see how little or much you need for your face. For me personally  I apply a dab to my forehead and cheeks each and then just work it into the face until there isn t any excess product left. I d recommend this approach if you have oily acne prone skin. Aside from two acne products  this and the cleanser from Vanicream are my routine and my skin has never looked better.
3324,Doug,1,17-May-17,8 people found this helpful,This is by far the best product for dry hands and feet I have ever used...and I thought I had tried everything. This product was recommended to my by a park ranger that saw me running in the desert in sandals...my foot ware of choice (free running). I told her the only problem with running in sandals or wearing them even is how dry and cracked my heels get. Pumice stone and sanding daily and using lotions and creams barely made a dent in my rough heels. She recommended CeraVe....odd name I thought. After a few months I ordered some on Amazon and within a few weeks it became a favorite of my wife and I. This stuff works where nothing else could.
3325,Miranda Reed,1,02-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,I have a weird allergy to aloe along with eczema that can leave burn bubbles on my skin and itching to the point that I scratch until I bleed. My mom gave me some of this and I loved it but ran out not too long ago. I had to reorder it here because I hate shopping in stores. It s creamy without being overly heavy  it s not greasy  and I don t itch! And this tub is huge!
3326,Stephanie,1,14-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,This product has changed my skin. It doesn’t brighten right away and it is a very heavy greasy cream but using over time I can see my skin improving. I won’t repurchase and gave this 4 stars only because of the parabens  petrolatum  dimethicone and other ingredients I would prefer not to be in my skincare.
3327,Noorah,1,24-Oct-18,One person found this helpful,I was using an exfoliating gel for my acne scars and my face was sensitive to almost every face cream I had. Now I throw them all out! This is by far the best moisturizing cream I ever tried! It’s fragrance free and my skin loves it. Also the size was a surprise to me I guess it’ll last more than few moths before re-ordering again.
3328,Tooturhorn,1,20-May-19, ,CeraVe Moisturizing Cream in a 19 oz size is an excellent daily moisturizer and love the larger size. I have very dry skin and I apply immediately after a shower to lock in the moisture  versus applying to dry skin. Also  I used the pump top from a 16 oz jar of CeraVe and it fits perfect. I highly recommend this cream. There is a slight fresh scent that may be just from the products  however  it is not scented otherwise.
3329,Courtney W.,1,05-Aug-17,One person found this helpful,(Female) I have normal to dry skin. This moisturizing cream feels thick  but doesn t go on sticky or leave a weird residue. The difference between the moisturizing cream and the moisturizing lotion is that the cream is mixed with petroleum jelly  so it is slightly thicker. I felt like this was a little too thick for my face  but it is great for use everywhere else. If you are looking for something for your face  I would try the moisturizing lotion. Otherwise  I love the moisturizing cream for my legs and back.
3330,Amazon Customer,1,26-Nov-18,One person found this helpful,I have super dry skin  live in the desert and have rosacea. Was super happy this product was not greasy  moisturizing and didn’t irritate my face which is allergic and sensitive to just about everything. I spent over $200 on product suggested from an ethictician and all they did was make me look like a beet. So happy I found this. Life saver.
3331,Shawn,1,13-May-19, ,I ve tried everything known to man  and out of pure desperation i did a search online for dry flaky skin and Psoriasis...i have Psoriasis in my ears  scalp and face. It just recently started on my face and i would wake up with massive dry flakes all over my face and chin. Nothing worked....multiple soaps-tons of lotions-Cetaphil...the list goes on....one dime size bit of this stuff  and it s GONE!!!!!! Whoever designed this in the lab is a genius
3332,MyLovelyKids,1,06-Oct-18, ,I use to buy Johnson s baby lotion  and I would say if not take packaging into consideration  I think many lotion brands are OK for my kids. However  I really like the products with seals. Johnson s baby lotion bottles use to have good seals. However  they changed their packaging design (maybe ingredients as well  but I am OK with that part of change) recently  and their baby lotion bottles no longer have seals. Fortunately  I found Create has this new Seal design. So I shift to Create. And the kids  pediatrician actually recommended Create too.
3333,Amazon Customer,1,26-Dec-18, ,This cream is just what our family needs...especially during the winter. It’s gets REALLY dry in Maryland. I tried using just coconut oil on my family’s skin for a while but I was always dry and my son started developing itchy eczema. As soon as I switched to this  his eczema cleared (in 48 hours) and all of us have much softer hydrated skin. I love this stuff. I also like that it’s not greasy yet spreads nicely for a thick cream.
3334,C. Joo,1,06-Feb-19, ,For some odd reason  in the winter time only certain part of my face dries out very bad and is constantly flaky. I ve tried different lotions  moisturizers  cream  etc. So I wasn t expecting much with this. I just purchased it because it came with a ton compared to the big name brand ones where it comes in a tiny little container. This cream though  is the only one that actually worked. I don t have flaky skin anymore!
3335,Laurel L.,1,22-Oct-18,One person found this helpful,OMG this stuff is the best. I use it for everything -- facial moisturizer; it doesn t dry out your skin under the guise of moisturizing like most products. Actually found this by accident bc my MIL had given it to my husband and he never used it. I took it when I ran out of my moisturizer and now will never switch back.
3336,Jordan E,1,02-Jan-19, ,I have super sensitive skin and most fragranced lotions irritate my skin. My dermatologist recommended this brand and I swear by it. The trick for me is that I apply this lotion after a shower to increase its moisturizeration. This was also a recommendation by my dermatologist. It’s thicker than traditional lotion  that’s why I prefer the twist jar. It also lasts a long time  maybe a few months with daily application.
3337,Alex A,1,25-Feb-18, ,FINALLY made it to my second tub. It lasts forever. I’ve tried so many expensive moisturizers and skincare products but this is by far one of the best.  I have very dry skin that would always flake and makeup would end up looking cakey. This stuff fixed that entirely  even in the winter months. I used MAC’s comfort cream for a while (also a great product!) but this is even better. It’s cheap  effective  and doesn’t have any fragrance.  It’s a thicker/creamier product than some other moisturizers but I prefer that to something runny and thin. Doesn’t leave you feeling oily or greasy and gets absorbed pretty quickly!
3338,Will,1,29-Nov-16,One person found this helpful,Probably the best moisturizing cream that I have ever tried. My skin gets intolerably dry and itchy in the winter months. I was desperate for some relief so I decided to give this cream a try. It works like a charm. It dries quickly and is not greasy. An added bonus is that i can also use it as an all in one facial cream. I apply all over my face including under eyes and neck twice a day. It is rich and luxurious but non-comedogenic so it will not clog pores. I have found a perfect solution that also saves me a few bucks. I m a happy camper.
3339,Eski,1,08-May-15,2 people found this helpful,I ve been using Cerave on my baby s chin  neck  and chest because of bad skin irritation caused by constant drooling and it CURED her skin! I bought this based on recommendation from a friend and I am so grateful to her. My baby s skin was so red  bumpy  and itchy - it was really bothering her. I had been wiping it frequently with a wet cloth  putting Aquaphor on it constantly and changing her bib every half hour - but nothing seemed to help - skin remained red and irritated. After just few days of using Cerave  I noticed her skin getting better. I would apply liberally before her naps and bedtime - her skin looks great now! There s no scent and the texture is very light - it really works like magic!
3340,Mark,1,23-Sep-14,One person found this helpful,I ve used many brands of lotions and creams  preferring the ones that don t feel greasy after application (like Vaseline Men). But my dermatologist has been on my case for several years  telling me that my skin s still very dry in spite of the lotions. I also had a few  barnacles  on my lower back that were unsightly. He told me to try CeraVe. Now I m a believer.  This is the first cream I ve tried that doesn t feel greasy  and it has worked incredibly well. I ve been applying it once in the morning after my shower; my skin stays moisturized for 24 hours -- and I m sure of that because my skin feels quite slippery when I get in the shower every morning. What I did not expect: The black barnacles have dissolved away. (I still have a few slightly raised brown spots  but the unsightly growths fell off after a few weeks of daily use.) CeraVe is a huge improvement over the lotions I ve been using for years.
3341,M. Hammer,1,14-Aug-16,9 people found this helpful,My daughter has had eczema for years. We had been using topical steroids per dermatologist recommendation for so long that the skin started thinking out and frankly making things worse.  This was the only lotion her sensitive skin tolerated and after discovering most of her eczema (and asthma) symptoms were prompted by an undiagnosed peanut allergy  she is on the mend but continue to use this lotion exclusively in lieu of the topical steroids. She still gets flare ups but are well controlled by this lotion.  I have purchased other CeraVe products including their face wash  sun screen and hand lotion. All are equally tolerated by my sensitive child.
3342,T,1,23-Jul-18, ,I love this lotion. I use it for my face & hands. It s not cheap  but you really do get what you pay for. It s silky smooth  not too heavy  but is VERY hydrating. No added fragrance  and no weird-natural-gross-lotion-y smell. It really hardly smells at all  and if it does smell  it s a nice light scent.  Love it and will keep using it as long as it s being sold!  (written by a 24-year-old female who loves good quality products)
3343,ILoveGadgets,1,24-May-19, ,I came across this brand over and over again while researching skin care but until I was better educated  I didn t appreciate why. Now I do. I apply this on my arms and legs every night. Ideally you should apply fresh out of the shower to damp skin but quite frankly I always am running too late every morning to make that happen. So nightly routine is how I use it.
3344,ReaderReader,1,02-Aug-18,One person found this helpful,My whole family cannot get enough of this. A few years ago my dermatologist gave me this for my eczema and I am so glad she recommended it. It s fantastic (non oily but smooths my skin so well). I can t use the facial products because I break out from them  but this cream for my hands and elbows is amazing.
3345,Liz L.,1,02-Oct-18, ,I work in a research lab  so I wash my hands constantly and am not allowed scented products. I am also very sensitive to scents since I don’t use perfume  fabric softener  or scented soaps. I love this lotion. There is no scent at all. It absorbs quickly in about 5-10 seasons and does not leave any residue - easy to put on gloves after. It washes away completely after washing  so it does have to be reapplied after each wash.
3346,Jeanine Akers,1,06-Jun-16,3 people found this helpful,This is the perfect moisturizer. Me dermatologist recommended it. It is not greasy or heavy at all. It soaks right into my skin and makes it feel moist and the plus is that it doesn t contain any perfumes or irritants. It is very reasonably priced through Amazon. My face used to feel very dry and tight. Now  my skin feels wonderful. My husband even commented on it.He told me my skin looked really good. I ll take that. :-)
3347,Mom of Two,1,23-Jan-19, ,First time using this and I am in awe! These harsh cold winters does a doozy on my skin. Gotnout of the shower  put this on and immediately felt a difference!! I don’t think I’ll buy another product that claims it moisturizes when it doesn’t. This does!! I don’t feel like an alligator! No smell  it’s thick...but that’s a good thing. Nice size jar and no pumps to worry about breaking!
3348,Davi,1,16-Nov-15,One person found this helpful,I was skeptical when I purchased this on the recommendation of my doctor. I went in for a skin complaint and she said she suspected it was dry skin. I told her she was wrong  but that I would defer to her judgement and her Ph.D. for at least a month. After all  I already moisturizer obsessively  and I don t pinch pennies on my skin.  So  I shoved all of my other lotion in the cupboard and gave this stuff a go. I have to say  my painfully itchy skin has gone away and I am even softer than I was before. I m hooked and I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who thinks their moisturizer isn t quite doing the trick or just wants to have the softest skin around.
3349,Chuck,1,13-Feb-19, ,I have very bad combo skin  oily and dry at the same time! Drives me nuts. I’ve accepted my oily skin but I can’t do the flakey  dandruffy skin around my eyebrows. I’ve tried all kinds of products to help and nothing has worked until I tried this. I apply this stuff every night and it’s phenomenal. It took a couple days to actually work but it was worth it! I went out of town for a week and didn’t have this and my skin started flaking again. I absolutely love this!
3350,Blue Bobo,1,30-Nov-18, ,This is the best stuff ever  especially for me in my 70s and dry aging skin being an unwanted inevitable side effect of continued survival. When my dermatologist noticed during my twice yearly sun damage reviw  she commented on my improved skin quality and asked what product I was using. I told her  and she said that was precisely what she d have recommended had I asked her for advice.
3351,ChevyMama,1,05-Apr-19, ,It’s nice to have found a healthy cream. I don’t need all the perfumes and additives that aren’t good for your skin. Great for sensitive skin and I’m so happy there’s ceramides to keep your skin protected and rejuvenated. *this is for delivery  please leave my products inside my gate  not outside for anyone to take* usually your good about this  not today tho.
3352,Just me,1,02-Jan-16,2 people found this helpful,This is a create product. I started using this after my dermatologist recommended it to me. I have dry skin and kept using lotion after lotion. One big mistake is that I was using lotion instead of cream. My biggest issue is getting dry skin once I shave my legs. I ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and I m noticing a huge difference in my skin; it s less irritated. It has a light scent once you re applying it  but that goes away. It would be great if it came in different scents  then I d need about 10 more bottles! Overall  absolutely awesome product.
3353,Dominique,1,28-Dec-15,One person found this helpful,I had been using prescription retinol to improve my skin but instead I got the retinol uglies. My skin dried out and peeled every time I used the retinol and no moisturizer even touched my horrid dry skin. Then I found an article suggesting ceramides for rehydrating and counteracting the retinol uglies.  Wow  I wish I had skipped the expensive facial mousturizers and had acquired CeraVe in the first place! I m finally seeing the results my dermatologist had promised from the retinol  and my skin looks more hydrated  smooth and glow-y than it has in years. CeraVe has been added to my  fountain of youth  lineup.
3354,Sven5000,1,30-May-18, ,I have eczema and it is very difficult to find products that work for my skin longterm. I have been ordering these Cerave creams for maybe a year or two now  switching back and forth between these and Vanicream (which was recommended by an allergist). They re around the same price and are comparable products. I feel like the Cerave remains on my skin for longer  due to the slightly thicker texture. As with any eczema approved products  it s unscented.
3355,David S,1,13-Sep-16,One person found this helpful,My dermatologist recommended this product  so i tried it. I have very dry feet and nothing every seemed to help except expensive prescription products. After 3 days of using this cream in the morning before I put on my socks and shoes  I began to notice that my feet had not been as scaly as they normally are. After a couple of weeks my feet began to feel so much better. I no longer have to worry about snagging my socks when I put them on and my feet are almost completely soft and smooth again. I couldn t believe it.
3356,Amazon Customer,1,20-Sep-17,One person found this helpful,My skin loves this moisturizer. I switched to this from more expensive daily creams and have been so happy. I use it on face twice a day. I have combination skin and this works great on the dry and the oily patches. I can see a difference in using this. I started using this on my arms where I struggle with allergy bumps and this is the only moisturizer that smooths these away.
3357,Ellen K. Savanick,1,27-Jan-15,2 people found this helpful,After weeks of itching on my legs and arms  especially at night  I was at my wits end. Tried everything I could think of to stop the itching  but the best solutions only worked temporarily. My daughter then reminded me that she had similar symptoms  bumps that looked and felt like poison ivy  while she was pregnant. Her dermatologist suggested CeraVe and it cleared it up. As soon as I received the CeraVe  I rubbed it on all my itchy places and the itch stopped---but  of course  it came back. However  now two days later  I see definite healing. No more itching and just little bumps on legs and arms. I expect that in another two days this itch will be a forgotten nightmare.
3358,realq,0,05-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,This was recommended by a friend but they bought the product at the store. I read the reviews and decided to buy from amazon. However the lotion is different and it makes face breakout. It seems it is a knockoff. The texture is odd after you rub it on. I realized the recent reviews did show the problems with the lotion.
3359,Joy Michaud,1,18-Mar-19, ,I bought this after reading a review describing the same symptoms I was having with the skin on my face- dry  rough  kind of scaly and nothing seemed to help - no lotion  oil  or scrub. The reviewer said this cream helped her in 2 days  so I took a chance and it was like a miracle! in less than a week it s almost completely cleared up. I can highly recommend!
3360,Random shopper,1,08-Jun-18, ,I developed a dry  patchy area on the side of my mouth  but figured it was dry skin due to winter. After a week it spread to my chin and other side of my mouth. I thought it would go away on its own but then three weeks passed. I tried moisturizers and coconut oil but nothing worked! I was frustrated and embarrassed by this patchy  scaley skin on my face! As a last ditch effort I tried cerave and it worked! It was much better after two days! Its now a month later and its still gone!
3361,Brian W.,1,07-Nov-17,2 people found this helpful,My hands are always crazy dry and a little bit of the CeraVe helped them stay soft for hours. I’ll be keeping this at my desk. You don’t need much and it’s really silky smooth and not greasy. Bedore ans after shots of a particularly dry area.
3362,Gladys zavala,1,17-Aug-15,2 people found this helpful,I ve always had really dry and sensitive skin. I had tried multiple face muisturizers but as soon as they would dry you could still see my skin was dry. It would also make my makeup look horrible. I ordered this one based on the reviews and I have not been disappointed. This moisturizer works amazing! It s is a thicker kind of moisturizer and the only moisturizer so far to help me with my dry skin. It has a great amount of product so I know it will last me a while. Overall I m very happy with this and will recommend it to anyone who has the same issues I had.
3363,M. Coe,1,07-Oct-17,7 people found this helpful,I am very pleased with this cream. It is much cheaper and better than what I used previously. It is not sticky or greasy. Like many people  I have some skin areas that are dry and other areas that are not. What is nice is that I can use this on both dry  normal  and oily areas and it does not result in breakouts. There is also no scent. The only time you can tell it is on is when you shower since you will feel it washing off. I find that impressive since it means it is staying on my skin all day.
3364,Kim (@kims_quest),1,25-Apr-19, ,I have the dryest skin everywhere. I can put this on my 38 year old face before bed  and my body  as well as my 4 year olds soft skin and it doesn t irritate either. It is super hydrating  no scent  and just an all around excellent cream. I will be trying the lotion next to use as a morning facial moisturizer.
3365,Coni,1,05-Feb-19, ,I bought this after getting really bad eczema on my hands and then it started on my arms. The skin was red and cracked and everything that I tried wasn’t making a difference. I bought this and put it on right before bed. It worked immediately and after a couple of days my hands were soft. I recommend this to everyone
3366,H. Hughes,1,30-Oct-18, ,This moisturizer is SO GOOD! Cannot stop raving about it. It is thick but is absorbed leaving a plump feeling in the skin. Even have my husband using it after he complained of flaking and dry skin. Good sized tub makes it perfect for using on all the important part of your body: face  neck  elbows  knees  toes  wherever! Have not had any breakouts. Only downside: NO SPF!
3367,Jack O.,1,28-Mar-17,3 people found this helpful,Seems to be the go-to product for eczema  which I m slowly getting under control. Wasted a lot of $$$ on other creams twice the price. I m glad this is reasonably priced because I have a large area to cover.
3368,Joanne Campbell,1,13-Feb-18, ,My daughter has eczema and I had given her a bar of CeraVe s facial soap which she likes very much. So I decided to look for more of their products for her. She now uses this moisturizing cream and is quite happy with it. She finds it soothing and healing without the irritation she has experienced with several other creams and lotions that are supposedly good for her skin condition. I m glad to have found CeraVe products.
3369,LDD,1,29-Oct-18, ,The first time I tried this product was thanks to my dermatologist. I have very sensitive skin  eczema and easily break out in rashes. This cream works wonders moisturizing and keeping skin well hydrated. It does not have any fragrance  so I put in a few drops of regular scented cream and it adds just a light perfume. Amazing stuff that I keep buying over and over.
3370,Drew Harper,1,04-Mar-19, ,I ve tried plenty of moisturizers over the years. CeraVe is the best overall value by far. It moisturizes without leaving a film and rubs into the skin very well. The large tub lasts a long time making it a great value for the money. Using it every day on my hands  arms and face and have no complaints.
3371,Rosa,1,08-Sep-16,4 people found this helpful,I have been using CeraVe for 5 years and love how it works and feels. No more dry skin. I only have to apply it once a day and my skin stays moist all day long. It is my one and only body moisturizer.
3372,Amazon Customer,0,21-Apr-19,One person found this helpful,I’m really surprised this got so many good reviews. The product I got was either old  or not real real CeraVe lotion. It didn’t look or feel like real CeraVe lotion. I ended up having to throw it away.
3373,Kindle Customer,1,08-Aug-18,2 people found this helpful,Rather heavy  but seems to do a good job. My doc said to ditch all that anti-aging stuff. My skin is MUCH better.
3374,DUSTIN,1,29-Nov-14,7 people found this helpful,I ve struggled with dry  scaly skin from time to time on my forehead that would simply fall off like a snowy day if I passed my hand over it. Unlike every other moisturizer on the market that advertises healing and repairing  this one actually worked! It worked well  instantly moisturizing  and in jus days  it repaired my skin. It is light and blends well. I ve never been so excited to come out the shower and put on a facial moisturizer... seems pretty ridiculous  right? Yes  but I get excited every time. Definitely worth it!
3375,Little Blue,1,30-Jul-15,2 people found this helpful,I ve had sensitive skin for years and it seems to grow worse with time. After having used many products with mixed results  I came across CeraVe and it is simply the best product for keeping the skin moist and itch-free that I have used. It is marketed as a cream but is mixed very thin. You get the advantage of a cream that locks in moisture  but it feels like a lotion  so it is not sticky. I cannot recommend this product enough. If you have eczema  psoriasis  dermatitis  or just dry skin  try this product.
3376,southern lady,1,20-Mar-19, ,This is the best skin and face cream for the money. I have dry skin  with normal to dry facial skin. No greasy residue or strong smell to interfere with your perfume. I think this CeraVe cream will be my favorite. It has the best ingredients for a very reasonable price. I finally tried it. No regrets.
3377,Andrea N.,1,12-Nov-17, ,CeraVe is the perfect facial moisturizer. It was recommended to me a few years ago and is the best moisturizer I ve ever used. Non greasy  lightweight and perfect texture. Leaves skin feeling soft and perfectly moisturized. No scent and great for sensitive dry skin. I would pay three times more for it if I had to because it s worth every penny for the benefits it provides. I cannot recommend this product highly enough and will never use anything else on my face.
3378,kassh4,1,30-Jun-19, ,I ve heard great things about CeraVe  so I decided to buy their lotion. Upon first application  I loved it because it was one of the few lotions that didn t leave a greasy feel on my skin. It felt super light and it didn t seem to clog up my pores. Also  it is super effective and works wonders. I got the pump originally but I ve heard that the tub is much better because you don t waste any  unlike the pump version. I would highly recommend this.
3379,aviraz,0,21-Feb-19,One person found this helpful,This lotion leaves a very thick sticky feeling. I had to wash it off. Definitely not suitable for the face despite the description of the product page.
3380,Sarah A.,1,21-Mar-18, ,I already have naturally dry skin  so in the winter it gets even WORSE. I felt like other moisturizers/lotions like Jergens were either instantly absorbed or sat on the skin doing nothing. When I switched to this CeraVe Moisturizing cream  it worked wonders for me! I paired it with a body butter on some extra dry skin days and I no longer have that ashy dry feel throughout the day and even into the next morning!
3381,Julie,1,15-Jul-14,One person found this helpful,This stuff works great (actually better than great). My new grandson had  baby acne  (that s what my daughter called it) on his face; so I scoured Amazon looking for the best cream and I now I know why this got the best reviews - it really does work! She put this on him and within 1/2 hour it was gone. Of course if you don t keep putting it on it will come back. He had also scratched his face and my daughter was concerned the cream would burn if she put it on  so I tried a little dab and nothing - so it didn t irritate the scratch  in fact it healed it! She continues to put this cream on him because it makes his skin soft and keeps it hydrated (we live California  lately it s been dry and hot).
3382,p. dixson,1,30-Sep-14,3 people found this helpful,This was a really important purchase that saved me a lot of money and doctor s visits. I had a really bad rash on my face around my eyes  between the brows  on the forehead  and it was very red and itchy. I washed my face patted it dry and put the Cerave Moisturizing Cream on it. I did this twice a day morning and bedtime. By the third day my face felt so much better and almost looked normal except for a few spots. The moisturizer was a little thick for the face but was the most highly effective moisturizer I have used.
3383,DMSlagSkal,1,05-Nov-18, ,Our young daughter has struggled with eczema since she was 7 months old. We ve tried allergy testing  elimination diets and just about every OTC cream to treat her skin.

3384,LK,1,27-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,I purchased this moisturizer after having problems with other product causing white heads. I love this product for my face and hands. It works well  does not cause white heads and is not greasy.
3385,Judy B,1,17-Sep-15, ,This stuff is incredible if you have acne  and fine lines. Unfortunately I didn t get many uses because of a mischievous 2 year old little girl who smeared the entire container from her head to her toes... with her clothes on. LOL. This product is about 17.99 at my local walmart so I was happy to find it at a cheaper price. I would recommend purchasing a pump to make the uses more sanitary.  Current facial routine  body shops tea tree cleanser Burts bees brightning cleanser (leave on for about 2 minutes) witch hazel toner Cerave moisturizing cream for day time Cerave renewing night cream at night And every 2 or 3 days Cerave SA renewing lotion

I also deal with mild acne  ezcema  and mild rosacea. This cream is the only cream that actually makes my face look soft and moisturized! My acne has actually improved and so has my other skin issues. I will always use this. It s very thick but not heavy at all. It absorbs into the skin and then I can apply my makeup about 15 minutes later.
3387,Michael Shoults,1,30-Nov-18, ,My 1 year old struggles with eczema. His doctor recommended this cream. Within a day  all of his eczema flair ups were gone. It’s now his daily lotion. Occasionally  I will apply twice a day (morning and night) whenever he begins to have rough patches. It has no lingering smell and is non-greasy.
3388,MommyMel,1,23-Mar-19, ,I have diabetes and along with it I have severe dry  itchy  scally skin. I ve been using Cereve for a few weeks now and I have noticed a significant improvement in all of those areas. It s not greasy and absorbs quickly but lasts a long time. I highly recommend this!!!
3389,J. James,1,19-Sep-14,14 people found this helpful,I always have had ok skin. It would break out randomly depending on the makeup I used or for whatever reason. I tend to have a bit of oil in the T-zone. But not overly oily or dry skin. A friend of mine suggested I use this on my face at night along with a very mild cleanser. Her thought was that my breakouts could be in part  due to over drying. This stuff is amazing. My skin is the best it s ever been. I use a mild cleanser in the am  followed by a moisturizer with SPF. At night I use a cleanser followed by this cream. No breakouts in months  just beautiful skin. Love  love  love it.
3390,Phylte,1,28-May-18,One person found this helpful,I’ve been using this for years as my all over moisturizer  including on my face. Completely odorless  it is chock full of actual active ingredients. I use the lotion version as well. My skin is smooth as a baby’s.
3391,Sudha Iyer,0,07-Jan-18,3 people found this helpful,I was surprised the container was not sealed. Should not the product be sealed? Upon opening the lid there was a large hollow in the cream as if someone scooped a portion of the cream. Not happy. .
3392,K. Gottlieb,1,05-Jan-15, ,This is a great moisturizer and the price is certainly reasonable. I was having a serious case of winter skin which was aggravated even more by the very low humidity level in our nearly airtight new home. After using this cream  it has cleared right up. This cream has a lovely feel to it and is easily absorbed into the skin. Does not leave you feeling sticky or gooey as some skin creams do. It is nearly odorless. I would recommend it to anyone. Have even applied it to my DH s hands when he was complaining they were dry. He usually hates hand cream or lotion but there were no complaints from him this time. In my opinion  this moisturizer is superior to many other far more expensive products.
3393,Brian,1,28-Aug-18,One person found this helpful,It doesn t have a strong smell and it keeps my skin fresh and hydrated. Especially useful in cold weather and helps with Keratosis Pilaris and the reduction of the visibility of it.
3394,Anna N,1,18-Dec-17, ,I love this stuff. It feels soooo good going on  nice and cold and soothing. It doesn t feel heavy at all  but it also doesn t absorb all the way  which it s not supposed to. I put it on right before bed  and when I wake up in the morning I still have a thin layer all over my face which I gently rinse off. My skin always seems brighter in the morning after I use this  and it just feels nice.
3395,Dr. Jerrold Katz,1,22-Dec-18, ,The skin on my hands was very dry and and my hands were filed with many cuts because the dry skin kept on cracking. I started to apply CeraVe moisturizing cream to my hands every evening when I went to bed. With less than a week my hand skin was soft and all of thecuts disappeared. It is a great product.
3396,Allison,1,18-May-18,One person found this helpful,This is a great lotion/moisturizer!!! I have excema on my face and instantly had partial relief!! I applied liberty and frequently at first. I anticipate over time it will be a huge difference!!!! My hands are so soft and non-greasy
3397,D. McGehee,1,10-Dec-18, ,I ordered CeraVe moisturizing cream and I was surprised how well it worked. After washing my face and giving it a good rinse I put a warm wash cloth on my face and hold it there a few seconds. The warm rag opens my pores so the CeraVe cream can penetrate into my skin. I use it once or twice a day.
3398,Sa.Ma.Ga,1,09-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,I’ve never been a lotion person much less a cream one. Everything I’ve used before has felt like it jut sat on the top of my skin. This cream  however  felt like it melted into my epidermis immediately with no greasy feeling afterwards.
3399,Queenleo42,1,18-Mar-19, ,CeraVe makes some of my favorite skincare products from the drugstore and finding a jar this size at this price was a steal. I love this cream in the winter for my eczema. It soothes my dry skin and feels so good on my skin it s a godsend. You can t go wrong purchasing this.
3400,Stylus,1,02-Feb-19, ,Especially nice to use as a body cream. Would be 5 stars  but it s quite expensive. Used a few drops of lavender essential oil -- mixed in well as the CeraVe ihas a whipped texture. Now smells wonderful  bu I m afraid ihe product is too expensive to use as liberally as I d like.
3401,Runner,1,31-Dec-15,2 people found this helpful,This is a great formula  but I think next time we will be spending the extra money for the pump container. I was unsure if we would even like the moisturizer so I didn t want to go with the pump-version because I read some people experienced defects with the pumping mechanism so I didn t want to risk the waste. Next time I will go with the pump to make life easier--less mess and less contamination.
3402,RP,1,29-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,Very smooth and silky creme  goes on easy and absorbs well. Skin still feels moist the day after using it. Not as thick as Eucerin. CeraVe received a good rating from Consumers Report. Recommended.
3403,Jamie,1,13-Dec-17, ,I love this lotion! I have dry skin and live in the desert  and this has been such a help to me. I get skin cracks on my fingers every winter  but I kid you not  after using this lotion for a few days  they healed and have not come back. This is the first winter I ve been using it  and I am so hopeful. It is very thick and creamy. I ve even used it on my face at night  and notice a difference.
3404,Marnie,1,02-Apr-19, ,I use CeraVe all the time. It is not greasy and helps to keep my hands moist and comfortable. And  just for the record  my Dermatologist recommended this brand. Glad I tried it right away  because it really has helped me. I m a pet owner and love to cook  so  I m always washing my hands!
3405,jazzfl,1,01-May-14,One person found this helpful,Based on the review that said this moisturizing cream was beneficial in helping another person heal skin that was prone to break easily and develop sores due to person s medical condition and medications  I purchased this cream. It does moisturize extremely well  and heals/conditions skin so that it does not break and bleed leading to skin infection so easily. When used sometimes more than daily but certainly daily it does exactly that. It absorbs fairly readily and does not leave the skin feeling greasy . The smell is very mild and I certainly will continue to use it. have now been using it about 2 weeks and my skin has improved significantly.
3406,Lab K.,1,27-Jun-19, ,I *had* pretty bad ezcema and have very dry skin. I use it right after i shower every day and have been for almost a year. Most of my ezcema on my body has disappeared while using this and keeps my skin very hydrated. Barely any scent and very good for people with sensitive skin. I highly recommend this
3407,Marilyn Auerbach,1,10-Dec-18, ,I m Fred/ Marilyn s husband I have been using moisturizing cream on my scabby legs for many years; doctors orders. So I went through the motions. Nothing changed. Ran out of the old cream  and bought yours. It works. Scabs disappearing. leg skin softening. It works. Thank you for a fine product Fred
3408,btb65,1,16-Mar-19, ,My skin was getting so dry this winter so I purchased this cream to use at night and also under my makeup. It is absolutely the best I have found for my dry skin and I use it all over when I have a problem area. Best product for the money.
3409,Martha,1,15-Mar-19, ,I always have used a ton of oil and lotions to moisture my body. Our climate is dessert dry. Winter temperatures are below 20 at times My skin is sensitive to extreme cold ??. I have recommended CeraVe makes my skin moisturized and very soft. My sister and granddaughter love it also! I have seen changes smoothing cellulite too! Bonus!!!!!
3410,Arlene,1,25-Oct-15, ,Best moisturizing cream I have ever tried. After falling in love with their face wash I decided to give this a try. Ive tried the cream both on my body and face. I have oily skin on my face  yet my body is very dry. So this cream did not work on my face  it made it too oily. But on the contrary  it does wonders for my body. I usually have to buy intensive  ultra healing body creams to keep my skin on my legs from cracking especially during the winter  and sometimes even those creams fall short. This cream really penetrates my skin leaving it hydrated the entire day. And the best part is that it does not leave any sticky  oily residue. It truly gets absorbed by my skin and looks like I m naturally smooth and hydrated. I also noticed that if I skip one or two days of moisturizing with this (which happens often) my skin doesn t crack like before. Hands down best cream!! I will keep repurchasing.
3411,tess,1,28-Jan-15,4 people found this helpful,I have plac psoriasis and it s not good. It was recommended to me by an online health post to purchase CeraVe and I think it s wonderful. The syndrome that I have  dries my skin up so very much it s uncomfortable. The moisturizer feels really good on my skin and I can see it s helping it. I just hope that others see this and it can help them  also. Thank you  Amazon!
3412,Jessie,1,21-Dec-18, ,I have really bad dry skin. This has been great. My doctors have recommended it and it has been great. It may be a little pricey  but it s really honestly worth it. The super cheap lotion just dries your hands out more. This is the good stuff  for real.
3413,Nanny to 6,1,01-Dec-18, ,The price of this product was very fair. The quality of this product is in many ways better then the more expensive body crimes. This time of year my skin gets quite dry but if I use the CeraVe daily; it keeps my skin moist and a little goes a long way.
3414,AmazonUser,1,08-May-19, ,This cream is my favorite! It has no scent and really rubs in quickly. It makes my hands feel smooth without being oily and is not heavy feeling. I only use it on my body  so not sure how it would be for the face  but it is a great moisturizer.
3415,Abraham Friedman,1,28-Jun-19, ,I was recently diagnosed with sensitive skin and this helps a lot with the dryness over the winter. It goes on easy but doesn t feel greasy. It doesn t have a heavy perfume smell so I don t notice it after I apply it.
3416,Tiffany D Knox,1,29-Apr-19, ,I ve read about this from model s posts and skin care articles. It moisturizes well & sinks in quickly. Barely leaves any residue. And best of all does not make my VERY sensitive skin irritated. You get a ton for the price too.
3417,Tinuwiel,1,01-Nov-18, ,Good cream loaded with good ingredients. I am using on my face and hands. I have dry and sensitive skin for reference. It is hydrating but not enough for hours. Also  it is absorbed quite well. It doesnt leave a residue so it is not providing any slickness for foundation.
3418,Ed Margoscin,1,13-May-19, ,I have very dry skin and hard to heal skin. This cream is helpful for both. I had fallen into a brush pile and had a plethora of cuts on my legs and arms. This cream calmed everything down and allowed it to heal super fast.
3419,Kate,1,18-Jun-18, ,I was in need of a good face lotion. Reviews were great on this so I bought it. A lot thicker and greasier (but not horrible) than I am used to  but i must say I do feel moisturized and it lasts all day. I have pretty sensitive skin  turns red and burns for some lotions. This has been doing the job. So far so good.
3420,Jamie,0,16-Dec-18, ,I bought this as a new facial moisturizer due to coworkers raving about how nice it is. First application seemed to make my face baby soft. Used it twice more  and now for some reason my skin is super dried out  and feels like I ve gotten a chemical burn. Since this is the only new thing added to my routine  I know it s to blame. However  it just wasn t the right product for me. Maybe it s my super sensitive skin  I m not sure.
3421,Marie in Ohio,1,21-Mar-19, ,I have very dry skin and the dermatologist recommended CeraVe. The first time I put it on my face I felt a difference. I use it all over my body. It s not oily  heavy  nor does it have an odor. I am a very satisfied customer.
3422,Phanessa,1,28-May-19, ,Love this stuff. We all suffer from dry  sensitive skin. This is very hydrating. I use several CerVe products including face cleanser  night cream  plus our dermatologist recommends it for my son who had bad eczema.
3423,Judy s Blooming Reviews,1,19-Feb-18, ,I have purchased this product several time. The first time it was on the recommendation of my dermatologist. Now  I purchase it because I really like it. I put it on right after I shower before I am completely dry. That way is smoothes on. I know it works well because the next time I shower  I can still feel it on my skin. I really like this product.
3424,Anna Aryeh,0,12-Mar-19, ,I hate this stuff. It feels sticky on your skin and kinda makes your skin feel like it has a sticky film on it. It made me itch. And on top of that it does not smell good. I will never buy it again and recommend you don t either.
3425,Shelley Lane,1,06-May-19,One person found this helpful,Dry skin from chemo therapy & my dermatologist only recommends CereVe products
3426,Christine,1,10-Mar-19, ,If you check ingredients  you will find that this cream contains many of those found in high end moisturizers and anti aging creams. It s unscented  non irritating and perfect for all ages. In fact  Cera Ve did the trick for my baby granddaughter s eczema. It s a staple in our home.
3427,Krissi Lawton,1,25-Nov-16, ,My skin was extremely dry from living in Arizona with fine skin. It was getting worse by the day  to the point where it itched. I spoke with my dermatologist who recommended this cream and some of their other care products. This cream is AMAZING. It went on a little thick the first time for some reason; probably because by skin was so chased. After the first use  I could notice a wonderful difference in the appearance and feel of my skin. Highly recommend.
3428,CheeryToes,1,09-Oct-15, ,Holy Mackerel! Buy this stuff! True test is the back of my hands - they were crepey - I put the cream on...they were not crepey. I mean it was almost instantaneous! My skin is so very very dry and this has really helped. I was (and still am) a firm believer in coconut oil  but even coconut oil didn t work on the backs of my hands like this cream. I am in love. LOVE!! I use the lighter lotion and their facial washes  as well. I just love this product! LOVE!! I should have taken a before and after picture of the back of my hands... Grandma hands no more!
3429,Jennifer Sloan,1,03-Aug-13,One person found this helpful,This is a REALLY good product for many  many skin types. It s gentle and non-irritating and works very well for me in general. The only thing I don t love is that  immediately following application  it feels like there is a film on my skin. That being said  it s not sticky or uncomfortable  but I can definitely FEEL it there. This is somewhat helped if I use less product (hardly any at all) but then I don t feel like I m using enough and sunscreen/makeup doesn t apply as smoothly. I recommend this moisturizer because it IS good for so many different skin types and for the price (lasts forever)  I don t think you can beat this product  but it s not *quite* perfect.
3430,Jackie,1,14-Dec-16, ,I bought this product after reading reviews were people used this as a base to make their own lactic acid lotion. I mixed the CeraVe with Lactic Acid 88% 5oz for Home Brew by Home Brew Ohio (https://www.amazon.com/Lactic-Acid-88-Home-Brew/dp/B000MBW7V2) which I ordered off of Amazon to make a 15% Lactic Acid lotion. I have been using my lotion mix (with other softeners) and I have had great results. I will be ordering this again.
3431,dcshippy,1,01-Mar-19, ,I suffer from extremely dry skin all year but the Winters are much worse. Finding a good moisturizer that lasts all day has been ellusive until I found the Cerave cream. Terrific texture and all day moisture. Highly recommend it.
3432,BlissfullyySweet,1,17-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,My favorite cream for my son s eczema. It s extremely hydrating and I notice that he itches less when I apply it. It s not greasy and sinks into the skin.
3433,MLM,1,17-Apr-17,3 people found this helpful,I use only CereVe lotion. This one I use on my face  but the one with the blue lid keeps the driest of dry skin moist all day!
3434,K. Galiano,1,13-Jan-19, ,Was actually recommended by my dermatologist - legit! Glad to know it’s not just some marketing scheme. Cream is thick  blends easily and has not caused any sensitivity reactions at all. Works best when you put it on damp skin.
3435,Sweet Lew,1,27-Aug-18,One person found this helpful,A little too thick. Lots of product though for a great price. Does the trick of keeping me mortiurzed. I prefer it for after I shower.
3436,Iamincalifornia,1,15-Jul-18, ,We originally bought this for our baby s sensitive skin but it is so moisturizing and non-greasy that I now use it myself after each shower. I enjoy that its very rich without being greasy  I also like that it has no scent  so will not mix with any perfume in a weird way.
3437,HB,1,03-Apr-16,One person found this helpful,I love this cream. It s a little thicker than lotion  but still liquid enough to be pumped. It goes on smoothly and dries without leaving a sticky or oily feeling. It s gentle enough for my kids  sensitive skin  and when applied to my kids  dry or irritated skin  it heals up quickly. Cream has no scent. I have a pump from a previous purchase  so I was happy to find a replacement tub of the cream here.
3438,Fannins,1,19-Sep-18, ,I am a cancer patient who was in search of an unscented moisturizer as the chemo treatment is brutal to my skin. After using this moisturizer  my skin feels better than before treatment began. Absolutely no scent and no greasy feel. Highly recommended.
3439,Michael and Brittany Tshudy,1,30-Apr-19, ,I believe that I have have somewhat sensitive skin because I have eczema and occasional eczema outbreaks. This lotion does not irritate my skin and is has a nice light feel. It does not leave my skin feeling greasy.
3440,Reuben B. Bowie,1,29-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,Would prefer a pump bottle or jar. Difficult to get out of jar when used near bottom
3441,Munyu,1,13-Oct-18, ,I have been suffering for severe dry sole for many years and tried so many products but nothing helped. When I started to use this I notice this is the one I was looking for. I am very happy and not afraid of bare foot sandals in summer.
3442,MZU123,1,16-Jan-15,One person found this helpful,Perhaps one of my best Amazon purchases. It gets cold here in the winter  and my skin would get itchy and dry. I just use this stuff after I shower or after I shave  and my face stays comfortable for the rest of the day.  I also have less acne. I never had much acne  but I think this stuff really was the nail in the coffin. You can apply as much or as little as you want too  which is nice. Seems like the 16 oz container is going to last a very long time  even though I am applying the stuff pretty liberally.
3443,Ana,1,05-Apr-16,One person found this helpful,Very hydrating and  importantly  not oily. As a cream/lotion/moisturizer lover I have tried many many products and this is the best body cream I have encountered. It s very good for the winter when my skin tends to dry out a lot more. It s so moisturizing that I can feel it washing off of me when I soap up in the shower even after a whole day and an intense workout. Absolutely recommend.
3444,M. Wiley,1,13-Jul-14,2 people found this helpful,Our allergist recommended this cream for our baby s eczema and it is working brilliantly. The sandpaper feel to her skin is gone and her red patches are slowly healing. Scratches seem to go away quicker as well. Although I m not excited about all of the ingredients  I was convinced this was better than other  natural  and  organic  stuff we were using when I was reminded that eczema s irritated skin can let in other irritants (environmental allergens as well as natural ingredients like coconut  shea  etc.) that the body can become sensitive to.
3445,DKC,1,06-May-14, ,I have been using this along with the Benzoyl Peroxide treatment from Acne.org and it has done wonders in keeping my skin clear. I get out of the shower (once a day)  let my face completely dry  apply a pea amount of Benzoyl Peroxide  let that dry  then apply about 1-2 pea size lumps of this cream. It does wonders for dry skin in the winter. I still get oily skin  and this does feel a tiny bit greasy after applying (not uncomfortable though by any means) though in the summertime which is probably due to my skin complexity. I just wish CeraVe made an in-between moisturizer since their lotion doesn t seem to do much and this can be overkill if you use too much in the humid weather.
3446,BernaReads,1,25-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,I love this cream so much I keep reordering it! CeraVe goes on light and stays on all day.
3447,TZ,1,07-Jul-14,One person found this helpful,Recommended to me by a dermatologist for my dry  eczema prone hands. This is the best moisturizer on the market. I ve tried everything else (Aveeno  Eucerin  Aquaphor) and everything gave my hands an oily feel and sometimes left a rash. And the eczema kept coming back. I switched to this and loved it! It didn t feel oily  soaked right in  and as my hands were much better protected  the eczema isn t so bad. My only complaint is that it comes in a tub so I have to stick my finger in to scoop the moisturizer out  which feels to me not that hygenic.
3448,Math Coach,1,29-Aug-15,One person found this helpful,This moisturizer was recommended by my dermatologist. It is the best skin lotion I have ever used. My skin was very dry from living in a desert area. After only a couple of days  my hands are soft  and smooth. I use this on my arms and legs  too. There is a special CeraVe cream for the face. I have not tried that yet. I will continue to buy this body cr?me. It does a wonderful job keeping my skin looking and feeling young again.
3449,Anthony A,1,27-Nov-18, ,I really love this. Dermatologist recommended. Locks in moisture without feeling greasy or oily. Perfect daily use for winter in dry climate with itchy alligator skin. I notice the difference when I use it. Less itchy  healthier.
3450,Boz from Oz,1,26-Feb-19, ,I have tried many moisturizers for many years to clear up dry skin on my face. This moisturizer stays on while the others evaporate in a few hours. After a few day my dryness cleared up and has remained cleared up.
3451,DLM,1,18-Sep-17, ,My dermatologist recommended I use this because my skin was so dry and flaky. I m 55 and the past 3 years my skin has become crepey in texture which is very frustrating. This doesn t work miracles and completely erase it  but it s 100% improvement with no more dry flakey skin. I put it on after my shower and it really is best I ve used.
3452,Greg Brown,1,16-Dec-18, ,I have eczema that seems to flair up for reasons I can never figure out. My dermatologist just recommended this CeraVe cream it s pretty amazing. I ve tried just about every other lotion available and this is by far the best I ve found at keeping my skin subtle.
3453,Paul G.,1,03-Nov-13,2 people found this helpful,For those who have chronic dry skin  you may want to try this. Like any cream or cosmetic  or over the counter medications - some works for some  and not for others.  I have tried very many creams and lotions to handle dry itchy skin (pretty bad ... lots of rashes  etc). I came across this a year or so ago and it works perfectly for me. There are those who say it s too oily  it s not oily enough  this and that. I suggest you try it - and see for yourself. I started using this and i don t even need to use it daily. it s that good.
3454,chezsan,1,08-Jan-17, ,This lotion was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It is fantastic. Very moisturizing and it is not greasy at all! I have used other brands in the past that are so greasy I could hardly stand them and it was so hard to wash them off of my hands. With this one you don t even really need to wash it off of your hands because it rubs in completely. I just wish it weren t so expensive!
3455,Criscassee,1,29-May-18, ,You name it  I ve tried it. I ve had eczema all my life and only one cream has worked this well and it s only obtainable by Rx only. If you have eczema/dry or sensitive skin that is easily irritated by changing of seasons look no further  this is the best option.
3456,Sidra Coman,1,02-Apr-09,4 people found this helpful,Every winter I used to scratch my skin until it bled! my son unfortunately was born with the same curse of dry skin and eczema. Non of the steroid creams and other prescription medication had a lasting effect. When he was 18 months old  I decided I could take this no longer. I honestly did not want my child dependant on all the prescription strength medication anyway. CeraVe was a heaven sent solution! Recommended to us by a dermatologist whose wife uses the cream for eczema. The product helps mild to moderate eczema  and is fabulous for super dry skin. In my family  we use it twice daily. My itchy skin is no more  and my son s eczema is gone! The only con  the cream has kind of a slimy texture to it - but  I m willing to put up with it.
3457,Kimberly,1,30-Dec-16, ,I initially bought this in hopes of getting rid of a small rash that I had had for over a year that refused to fully go away. I started using this several times a day and within two weeks  it was completely gone. Not only that  but I noticed that the area that I had been applying it on  where the rash had been  was significantly smoother than the rest of the skin surrounding it. This made my skin so smooth! I m definitely going to buy this again and start using it on more of my skin.
3458,Tia James,1,07-Dec-17, ,My dermatologist recommended I use this with my CeraVe cleanser and it is wonderful. A little but goes a long ways so it lasts me a good amount of time. No overpowering scent. I have super sensitive skin and have really loved this moisturizer. I plan on using it for a while. Definitely recommend.
3459,Laura,1,08-Nov-14,One person found this helpful,Great moisturizing cream. It is the only cream that makes my skin soft without having a greasy feeling to it  or requiring what seems like hours for my skin to absorb the lotion. Within a week I noticed a big difference in the softness and hydration of my skin. Yes it can be more expensive than other lotions  but you don t need a large amount of it to do a great job so this outweighs the cost of the lotion. I always recommend this lotion to anyone looking for a moisturizing cream.
3460,Arun Venkat,1,20-Apr-19, ,After researching online and reading the reviews of this product  I decided to give it a try and I glad I did. It helps with my dry skin and leaves my skin feeling soft. I ll buy it again.
3461,Tonya E.,1,23-May-14, ,It is worth every penny. It is not greasy  no harsh chemicals ... simply great!  My daughter is currently 10 months and we ve been using it since she was about 2 months (weve only gone through 2 jars). While I think her eczema has decreased over the past few months  even at its worst  the CeraVe cream kept her moisturized. I just wish they had a small travel tube that I can keep in her diaper bag!  We tried several other creams ... but this is the only one that  tamed  her outbreaks.  I definitely recommend for adults and children with severely dry skin.
3462,Mandi,1,21-May-18, ,Great for sensitive skin. Very thin and sleek; doesn t feel bulky or over-coat my skin. Seems to soak in immediately. I hate when I apply lotion and then need to wait like 15 minutes before putting on jeans or something. This is light and refreshing. No scent.
3463,Matt,1,13-Dec-14,One person found this helpful,My dermatologist recommended this stuff to me about a year ago when I got some really nasty Eczema on my face when the weather got really dry and cold. She also gave me some other medication to try  and as I was originally getting better results from the other stuff  I didn t stick to using this stuff like I should have. When the weather started getting cold and dry again this year  I finally put two and two together  bought some of this stuff  and the problem was solved before it really had a chance to even get started.
3464,Janice Ochoa,1,27-Dec-16, ,I love that its slightly more affordable here than getting it at the store. this was recommended to me by my allergist. keeps my skin well hydrated. Helps with diminishing the occurrence/ length/ itchiness of my dermatitis. My allergist recomended me to put this on right when i get out of the shower (lock in the moisture). I hate that feeling  but it works better than lotion.
3465,Adrienne,1,29-Nov-17, ,I have battled with finding the perfect face lotion but I am convinced I have finally found it. It hydrates and moisturizes all in 1 product. My face was very dry before and I never found a lotion that was thick enough to really hydrate but also didn t cause skin irritation. This product does it.

This--in combination with wearing gloves for some of my messy jobs--has finally gotten one finger healed and the other one under control. It s not thick and waxy  but you can feel that it stays on your skin better than other creams.
3467,adari,1,01-Jan-19, ,The cream has been great for my dry  sensitive  eczema prone skin. Moisturizes well without feeling oily. Have been using it for over 2 years now. Has worked better than any other longe range of brands I have tried. Added bonus is that my dermatologist recommended it.
3468,FAMAZON,1,10-Apr-19, ,It is a heavy moisturizer so it will feel oily on face/body for a little while.Large jar for a couple of months supply.Price is reasonable and a trusted brand product.
3469,Maria,1,13-Jan-19, ,This is technically a body moisturizer  but I bought it because I saw reviews for it being used on the face. It’s a great face moisturizer that I use at night! It goes on not too thick  and it’s a great addition to my winter skincare routine.
3470,SS,1,16-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,Works great  not crazy about the texture. Its really thick and creamy  I can feel it fir a while after I put it on.
3471,Patti,0,05-Sep-18, ,This CeraVe cream was recommended by my long time dermatologist for improving my aging skin.. The cream would not absorb into the skin on either my arms or legs. Next morning in shower I would be slippery from all the cream just sitting on my skin..not to mention cream on PJs. Other reviewers have had this same issue. I have no problem with other creams and lotions. My favorite is Beessential cream with lavender and berganot.

3473,JRBH,1,14-Mar-19, ,I am a Cancer patient undergoing a lot of Radiation. I must moisturize my skin and this was one of the products that was recommended by my Oncologist.  GREAT PRODUCT!

3476,Fooey,1,04-Sep-18, ,Always keep my skin silky smooth. Especially my face. Have gotten many compliments on how smooth my skin looks! I live in Colorado and keepin my skin smooth is really hard sometimes especially when i work outside all the time !
3477,Mike M,1,16-May-19, ,I just found out I have eczema and need to moisturize forever. The CeraVe Moisturizing Cream has no scent and no icky feeling. When I take a shower the next day  it is still doing the job... very nice.
3478,craftysharon,1,27-Sep-18, ,I have spent a small fortune on cream. First time since FOREVER my skin is dry. Cerva is the only cream ice used with a positive result. I d do a free commercial. Ladies stop buying thing that don t work. Try it.??♥?
3479,Sandra Hudson,1,11-Aug-18,One person found this helpful,I have a lot of skin problems and I love using this product. It is really good for my dry skin.
3480,true60,1,13-Jun-18, ,We’ve tried them all...dermatologist recommended for my skin problems during cold winter months. Moisturizer lasts all day  leaving skin hydrated and healthier looking. Have brought this cream 4xs  for once a product that works.
3481,Dezzy,1,01-Aug-18, ,I bought the product to apply it in my face due to use of retinA  but I was having a really bad case of KP at the same time. I started using it in my arms and it helped me sooo much! My KP is not even noticeable anymore!! ??
3482,M. Nutter,1,10-Feb-17,One person found this helpful,I have tried multiple times to have a skin care routine. My skin was dry and rough. I would occasionally put on some lotion that seemed thick as cake frosting.  I have used this product twice. It is light  easy to apply and my skin feels fantastic.
3483,Ree Strawser,1,25-Mar-19, ,This cream was recommended by a Dermatologist on the Dr. Oz show years ago. She said it was the best without costing a ton of money. I find that to be true.
3484,Liz G.,1,18-Mar-19, ,I use this twice a day on my face and neck and it s the BEST. Don t bother getting fancy expensive creams. This does everything you need! My skin looks awesome.
3485,Nancy Prince Jackson,1,02-Apr-19, ,This was recommended for my husband by his Dr. and it has helped tremendously with his skin rashes. He has super dry skin and this works well for him. Would recommend.
3486,Michael,1,12-Feb-17, ,I read this moisturizer was too thick. My experience with my first tub is the moisturizer is not too thick but almost too thin. I am comparing it to Eucerin Intensive Repair for Sensitive Skin (pump bottle). Eucerin is thicker even in the pump.  My choice for CerVe is based partly on my Dermatologist recommendation but moreover  the ingredients.
3487,ellen marie,1,04-Aug-18, ,This was recommended by my husband s dermatologist for his legs. (He is diabetic & has poor circulation). Goes on easily & is not greasy feeling. Too soon to see a difference but seems to be a good product & we are hopeful.
3488,Josh,1,01-May-15, ,7 years ago my daughter was diagnosed with eczema and her dermatolgist recommended using Cera Ve lotion regularly. This lotion has helped her tremendously. I now use it on myself as well as my other 2 kids  and it works...no more dry itchy skin! The cream has no smell  and rubs on very well. Two of my children s skin is extremely sensitive  to the point we have to use special detergents  soaps  etc. or their skin breaks out in a rash. Luckily  their sensitive skin can handle Cera Ve cream.
3489,dwagner,1,06-Mar-19, ,Great  fragrance free moisturizer. I use on my body  and on my face in wintertime. It s great to use before bed because there is no smell to have to deal with. This is now my preferred body moisturizer.
3490,Tina Oaks,1,16-Jun-19, ,Best moisturizing product I have ever used. I had a dry cracked and bleeding heel. Within 24 hours it was nearly healed. I recommend this product.
3491,Miss Action Jackson,1,12-Feb-19, ,I ve wasted money on a lot of moisturizers that didn t really help my skin at all. I can say this one is not heavy and a little goes a long way. I will continue to buy!
3492,Adrienne,1,12-Oct-16, ,I am battling dehydrated skin  this cream was recommended as a daily routine (between my serum & sunscreen)... I like how lightweight it feels. I can t say it s a miracle moisturizer because I m using several products  but my face has made tremendous progress in the last month and this face cream is incorporated into my morning routine. I think it s totally worth the price  too!
3493,Kevin K,1,29-Jun-19, ,Unless they discontinue this I ll never stop using it. This is so thick and moisturizing compared to other products I ve tried -- perfect as the final step of your nightly routine
3494,L. Baker,1,16-Mar-19, ,Our whole family uses CeraVe. First found out about it at my dermatologist s office. We have sensitive skin in our family  and this cream keeps our skin happy and moisturized.
3495,Sophie,1,05-May-19,One person found this helpful,i always use it for my sensitive skin. it is free of scent  but that is what i want. keep my skin moisture
3496,Emily Olson,1,14-Dec-15, ,I was pleasantly surprised by this moisturizer. I have used a CeraVe cleanser for a long time and love it  but their moisturizers always seemed very thin to me which doesn t usually work for my dry skin. However  a friend told me that this completely got rid of their dry winter skin and so I thought it was worth a shot. I m so glad I tried it! Despite how thin the moisturizer is  it worked wonders for my arms and legs which were dry to the point of scaly. After using this for a couple of months  I can confidently say I no longer have dry skin!
3497,Gabrielle,1,16-Oct-17, ,I bought this to use for every day. A bit on the thick side. I slathered it on my face (yes it feels gross; its a trick used by Marilyn Monroe) to replace primer  and my make up stayed all day.. and mostly through night s sleep (Guilty-dont sleep in your make up!).  I will update my review after using it for a month. Thank you CeraVe :)
3498,Jan H,1,24-Aug-17, ,Nice moisturizer andnot greasy or sticky. My daughter is a physicians assistant in dermatology and it a cream that is recommended. We also use it on my mother s extremely dry skin and it works for her too. It is a cream  not a lotion so it is a little heavier but spreads well. No odor so that is a plus or minus depending on what you want.
3499,Nana2BoysNC,1,04-May-19, ,After being recommended by my primary doctor for dry skin  I tried this brand. I have loved every one I purchased and this is no exception. It is non-greasy  absorbs quickly  does not feel sticky without a scent. Now my husband is using and likes it too!!
3500,Lizzardo,1,28-Jan-19, ,I’ve only used it for a day so can’t say much about its effectiveness. But it’s a nice big jar. It came sealed and looked untouched. Fragrance free and feels nice not greasy.
3501,Lana,1,22-May-19, ,I like how quickly it is absorbed into my skin and how it doesn’t feel like some lotions do that feel like there is a heavy residue on my skin. I also really appreciate how moisturizing this lotion is for my very dry skin. This moisturizing cream is better than any lotion I have tried before and I have tried a lot of lotions.
3502,Susan G.,1,10-Jun-19, ,My Dermatologist suggested this and I am truly Amazed at how good it is. I ve been struggling with skin cancer for years and this cream has made my skin feel like a Baby s Skin!
3503,Amy,1,01-Jan-15,One person found this helpful,This is the best lotion I have found for my DRY skin. I am allergic to aloe. yes I said aloe. the one thing almost all companies put in  sensitive skin  products. The first time I used this I was absolutely thrilled with the way it made my skin feel. I will continue to buy this because I can use it on my face and body. With no itching because there is no aloe in this cream. If you try it I know you will not be dissatisfied in any way.
3504,lola,1,28-Nov-17, ,Nice cream  great price  wonderful volume! Just got it so will have to wait to see how it works over time  but feels good on my skin and appears to do a good job of moisturizing. Finally  a good cream that does not cost an arm and a leg for each drop....loving that
3505,Robert G,1,18-May-19, ,I bought this based off of the reviews and it turns out my dermatologist recommends this exact product too. No funky scent and no dry skin.
3506,Ash,1,20-Aug-18, ,after reading an article that this cream works better and absorbs more quickly than a lotion  i switched from the Averno Is been using for years and am happy with the improvement I see using Cerave.
3507,Bill Hess,1,14-May-18, ,This is the best skin lotion I have ever found and I ve been using lotions for decades. It was recommended by my dermatologist to combat dry itchy skin. It works  has no fragrance and leaves no oily trace. Perfect.
3508,ElaineDiggs,1,15-Feb-16,One person found this helpful,My daughter has eczema and sensitive skin. I am 100% convinced that using this out of the shower keeps her skin from breaking out  itching and burning. We ve used CeraVe since she was born. 10 years and counting! I ve tried cheaper and more expensive tub lotions and they do not compare to CeraVe. It s well worth the money!
3509,AnikaG,1,01-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,One of the few face creams that works for me and doesn t cause a weird burning sensation.
3510,A. S. Beasley,1,11-Jun-19, ,Excellent product. Moisturizes skin during the winter when warm heated air causes dryness  It also relieves irritation and minimize itching
3511,SM,1,28-Jun-19, ,This was recommended by my dermatologist for the psoriasis I have on my fingertips!! It soaks in without a greasy after feel.
3512,Jamie,1,28-Mar-19, ,I love this lotion and how it works for our skin  best I’ve tried. I just wish it didn’t have ingredients like parabens. Any way to clean it up a bit?
3513,Martin B.J. Boersma,1,05-Sep-18, ,Believe me  when I say  I could talk all day on different creams I ve used to keep my skin hydrated. My dermatologist recommended this one and it s the best cream I ve ever used. Period!
3514,Ailurophile,1,16-Jan-19, ,My dermatologist recommended this cream. My skin was just horrible. He recommended using a little oil on the skin  let it completely dry  then apply the  CeraVe . I don t even recognize my skin. Like being in baby skin!
3515,Blackbunny,1,31-Jan-14,One person found this helpful,Bought this for my 3mo. old baby eczema problem. This is a pedi-dermatalogist recommended moisturizer for baby eczema and it works well. I like this over Aquaphor and Vaseline because it s non-greasy and it seals skin moisture just as well. Then I started using it for myself as well over the winter because my skin got really dry and becoming really sensitive. After a week of use  my skin sensitivity problem is gone and my skin feels so soft and hydrated all day! I ve tried many luxury brand facial creams and spent a lot of $$ on them  none of them works as well as CeraVe. I m so glad that I found this and never need to buy those expensive luxury brand again!
3516,bill christensen,1,08-May-19, ,This is a superior moisturizer. It was originally recommended by my dermatologist. I have been pleased with its quality ever since.
3517,Roni J,1,21-Jun-16, ,My baby has eczema and his Dermatologist recommended this cream over all others that are sold over the counter. It has ceramides in it  and has really done a good job at starting to clear up his skin. It is lightweight and smoothes onto the skin easily  and is best used after a bath as well as several times throughout the day. No scent  which is perfect for this skin condition.
3518,Paige E.,1,07-Jan-19, ,I ve been in the middle of a TERRIBLE eczema flare up. After a few days of using this  the patches on my body are noticeably improving  which is a godsend. However  as other reviewers noted  my face is breaking out really bad -- probaby the worst breakout I ve ever had.
3519,Leigh,1,16-Sep-14,One person found this helpful,Very nice cream that helped relieve winter itching. Leaves a protective barrier. Look for products actually approved by the National Eczema Association--they are superior to others that just claim for helping itchy skin. My SIL (a hairdresser with her hands in water and products a lot) and her father are fair and have sensitive skin--they swear by this and another NEA approved cream. They ve tested a gazillion products at all price points.
3520,GH,1,17-Feb-19, ,My kid uses this due to eczema- it’s the only product that works 100% of the time in keeping the eczema at bay during peak allergy season.
3521,Seth,1,12-Feb-19, ,I was looking for a highly rated moisturizing cream and this is it. It s one of those items where you have in mind what you need to function in life  and this fits the bill for that lotion spot you may need in life. Highly recommend it.
3522,Les R,1,18-Feb-19, ,I have had skin issues (eczema  dry skin and rashes)  since I was a child. This is the ONLY cream that I can use and that works for me.
3523,Jennifer Owers,1,07-Oct-18, ,A great moisturizer for my dry flaky skin?especially for the price. I use it with the serum. The jar is a little large so I have to lay it sideways but otherwise it’s perfect!
3524,Patty P.,1,21-May-16,One person found this helpful,Holy grail. I m one of those who swear by it. I m not even put off by the  unsanitary  packaging. I love this stuff for my face or body. Smooth  silky  sinks in quickly. Very glad I got over my preconceived notions about putting  cream  on my oily face. This makes my face happy.
3525,austin,1,16-Jun-19, ,All fave moisturizers make my face break out. That was until I used this one. It’s great stuff! Helps me keep more face clear and not dry. Will continue to reorder forever!
3526,Whitney,1,09-Nov-17,3 people found this helpful,A few years ago  my dermatologist recommended CeraVe as an effective  low-cost product. Since that time  I have used and liked the face moisturizer and they eye cream. I got this Moisturizing Cream because the regular face moisturizer wasn t enough for my dry skin during the winter months. I tried coconut oil and other lotions without much success  and in some cases the products clogged my pores and caused breakouts. After using it only once my skin felt better  soft and hydrated. The cream soothed and moisturized without feeling greasy or clogging my pores. I love that this product doesn’t have fragrance or heavy oils.  Because we live in a dessert climate  all my family has dry  cracking  peeling skin during the winter months. I have been using the CeraVe Moisturizing cream on my children’s hands and faces with great results. So far  this is the best product I have ever used on my and my children’s dry skin  and I have been through many products to combat dry skin.
3527,SleeplessInSummerville,1,23-Oct-17, ,Recommended by my dermatologist to better protect skin against damage! Appreciate the fragrance-free  quick-absorbing product. (Tip: Consider purchasing the Surgeon s Secret Skin pump  also  to more accurately measure out small amounts of product.)
3528,Bermuda Punch,1,16-Aug-18, ,Primary care doctor recommended this product to me and she definitely picked a winner. Left arm and hand skin has sprung back to life with the use of CeraVe. I also would recommend.
3529,AutumnBlonde,1,27-Oct-14,6 people found this helpful,This cream is wonderful! It is very thick  but doesn t feel greasy or heavy. Initially is feels a bit thick  when applying it to the skin  but it absorbs quickly  and keeps your skin moisturized throughout the night (which is when I use it) or day. Since beginning use of this moisturizer approximately ten days ago  I no longer have any dry patches of skin on my face  which I used to get badly.  CeraVe contains the good stuff that one needs to keep their skin plump and moisturized (hydrolauric acid is your friend  people)  has no scent  and works better than creams I ve tried that cost three times as much. A little bit will go a long way  so the 16 ounce container I purchased will last for quite a while  making it a great bargain.  I use this after my retinol at night before bed  and experience absolutely no drying from the retinol as a result  despite the fact that I have mild rosacea  which I think it s definitely helping with  as well. I m not as red as I was beneath my nose and on my cheeks  and that s a definite added bonus of this moisturizer.
3530,stephanie,1,26-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,Good moisturizer but not the cream I expected. It is runny like lotion
3531,Heath,1,08-Sep-18, ,I’ve really enjoyed using this cream. I use a small amount on my face in the morning and it keeps me hydrated all day. It also works extremely well on my arms and legs which tend to get a bit dry.
3532,erd,1,29-May-18,One person found this helpful,I am allergic to many creams  but this one has been great! No order  moisturizing is great.
3533,T728,1,12-Mar-18, ,This is hands down the best moisturizer. My skin is normal  but face tends to be sensitive/acne prone. I can use this moisturizer on my face and body. A little goes a long way. I love that it s not scented  as that s perfect for everyday use. It s such a bargain too.
3534,Alejandro,1,27-Sep-17, ,This is great! I started getting dry skin around my neck and whatever I tried it would not go away. I bought a couple of other lotions  creams  jellies and nothing.  I gave this bad boy a try and I saw improvements after a day or two. This review sounds fake but I m just pretty happy with it.
3535,Jon Snow,1,12-Feb-19, ,I like this product. Initially purchased a smaller amount from local store. Absorbes quickly when applied and does not leave greasy residue.
3536,Becky,1,06-Mar-18, ,I was battling dry  peeling skin on my chin. I tried a huge variety of products and nothing worked. I started using a thin layer of this cream every morning and night and within a week my dry skin was healed. I now use it daily and I love it!
3537,Ju-Miao Cheng,1,22-Jul-16, ,We tried various lotions and creams for our daughter  such as Vaseline Intensive Care  Aveeno  Eucerin  Babyganics  and Cerave. These are all great products  but when our daughters elbows and wrist got really dry and super itchy  Cerave worked best. We also used some hydrocortisone to stop the itchy. Cerave helped her skin heal quick and look much better.
3538,Anna,1,18-Mar-17, ,When my dermatologist recommended it  I was skeptical since I have tried many products before and breakup terribly. However I decided to give it a shot and absolutely love it. My skin cleared up in just days. I even used it on my face. I was using Nivea for years  but this will be my # one product now.
3539,Doc Domino,1,10-Oct-15, ,I have nerve severe nerve pain in my feet due to Agent Orange exposure while in Vietnam. This product used three times a day works better than anything a doctor has prescribed...emphasis on using it three times a day. I apply it in the morning to get my day going. In the afternoon I liberally apply it again. Just before bed I rinse my feet-or bathe- and it becomes a blessing in a jar. It works and you won t stink.
3540,Janie,1,29-Oct-18, ,This is a great product and was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I love the sale he feel of the cream and the way it dries on your skin. I have recommended it to several friends.
3541,Soccer Mom,1,22-Mar-14,One person found this helpful,Do you have psoriasis? Eczema? dry skin? Wrinkles? sensitive to smells? This is the best cream I have ever tried. I hate creams and lotions but with dry skin and wrinkles and occasional eczema I need to use it. This is thick in the tub and you have to dip your hands in  but once it is applied  it is not too greasy and lasts on the skin all day long. My wrinkles are better. Mix it with a little hydrocortisone cream for eczema and it is gone in a 1-2 applications.
3542,Amazon Customer,1,17-Oct-17, ,Have only great things to say about this. I use it to remove makeup. I also use it at least twice a day as a moisturizer. Highly recommended by my dermatologist ! She was right.. Not greezy at all. I use on my entire face and neck. Hands and arms. Legs. Feet. Love it
3543,teacher,1,07-May-16,One person found this helpful,Yep  really like this cream. It is not at all greasy and I gob it on my hands  feet and legs. It is absorbed quickly and I can actually touch things afterwards. This was recommended by a dermatologist when I asked why and how to get rid of scaly looking skin on my calves. This helps a lot.
3544,Monique W,1,03-Feb-19, ,This is a very moisturizing cream. It feels good on the skin and it feels nourished all day. In addition  a little goes a long way.
3545,Eve Halley,1,21-Dec-18, ,Great moisturizer for the winter. In the winter  when my skin gets really dry  this is an excellent lotion to reach for for all over face and body. This product has never made me break out and doesn t have much a scent at all.
3546,Mr. Westwood,1,24-Jun-18, ,Years of heavy beer drinking has left my face with red  ruptered blood vessels which this seems to help with. I dunno how it works but it does and as a 35 year old man I swear by this stuff now.
3547,Mana Lima,1,12-Jun-19, ,This is an absolute must for your skin care! It had helped with my acne so much! And the price is amazing. I love this product.
3548,Kelsey Stratman,1,31-Jan-19, ,I have fairly sensitive skin and this does not break me out. It applies well  feels moisturizing  and dries within a few minutes  and does not feel sticky or slimy. Good  affordable day-to-day moisturizer.
3549,Elise A.,1,31-Jul-18, ,One of the best out there. I use this daily. There is no fragrance to irritate and I like this so much better than the other big brands out there. It is not greasy. It was recommended by my dermatologist a few years ago and I have been using it ever since. I have even used it on my kids since they were born.
3550,T Parks,1,07-May-17, ,I will never use another lotion again. I started using this when I was put on Accutane and my skin started to dry out. I had to use this morning and night on my whole body  and usually once or twice during the day on my face as well. I continued using it for a few months after and my skin continued to look great. When I stopped using this for about 2 weeks  long after I had stopped my medication  I noticed a huge difference in my skin- for the worse! I ordered another tub of this and haven t looked back since! It is a miracle worker for dry  irritated  sensitive skin. Nothing else has ever worked this well.
3551,Sandra Gomez,1,01-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,This is an exellent product.
3552,D,1,15-Mar-19, ,Love this it’s wgy i get a subscription it’s not greasy and has help with dryness of skin especially during the summer heat.
3553,Robert Garcia,1,02-Aug-18, ,Recommend by YouTuber Dr Dray applied to wet face and body. It’s just awesome but for the face don’t overdo or you get that crepe look. Thin layer on wet face just a great product.
3554,Arizona Sunshine,1,02-Sep-17, ,I Love CeraVe. The 16oz container is not always easy to find. I have a pump for the 16 oz container so this is great. The cost was reasonable for this product. Since I have used it my skin is much better. Living in the desert  you need a good moisturizer.
3555,C Gray,1,15-Mar-19, ,This cream is very good for relieving dry  itchy skin. It was recommended by my dermatologist and I ve been using it for over 5 years.
3556,Urbanite1985,1,24-Oct-15, ,My dermatologist recommended this product as I have extremely dry skin. I have used it for about a week and my skin is so smooth. I noticed the difference compared to normal lotions/creams the moment I put it on. It just has a different texture to a normal lotion. Per my doctors recommendation I do use this twice a day and it is paying off. No scent  excellent texture and it has healed my dry skin!
3557,Mikey,1,07-May-17, ,This is the beat moisturizer out there. I have tried all kinds. Cetaphil is good too but Cerave is better. I and my kids have eczema and dry skin. This works the best.  Don t get the pump lid. It s ridiculous. The pump straw is too short so you can t reach the bottom 20 percent.
3558,DH,1,13-Dec-18, ,Great moisturizing cream; love the large size at a great value. My dermatologist recommended it to me and I could not be any happier with it!
3559,Paul,1,15-Nov-18, ,This cream works very well but just that i have an oily t zone this makes it more oily either in winter or summer. Other than that the product is very nice
3560,Amazon Customer,1,15-May-19, ,Love this stuff! ALSO  pro tip: it is GREAT for chapped/over dried/cracked lips. place some lotion on at night for a couple nights and you are good to go for awhile (you do not have that rebound problem that you get with typical chapsticks).
3561,Cody,1,25-Oct-17, ,Have bought it many times  no more dry skin. I first tried it at Costco a lady put some on my hand  I walked around and noticed it wasen’t sticky alt all so bought some  when I ran out  Costco no longer had it so I bought it at Amazon and have many times since I love it
3562,Linda Vano,1,10-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,My dermatologist said this was the only lotion or cream I needed. I use it all over  including my face. It does the job of four other products.
3563,Krsone,1,07-Feb-18, ,He’s noticed an immediate improvement (2 days) to his red/dry/flaky etc T zone area on his face. Everyday it seems to get better and his skin looks and feels nice and soft. Very happy customer!! GREAT price too. Ty.
3564,Trish,1,09-Jan-19, ,I knew the jar is 19 ounces but was surprised when I saw how large it is! What a great buy! The cream isn t greasy and is easy to apply.
3565,Wm Jameson,1,16-Apr-19, ,Got this to try on my very dry sun damaged skin. Works pretty good but I wish they made a product for extra dry skin.
3566,Damzlfly,1,30-Mar-13, ,My skin is like leather in the summer. In the winter  it s like croc hide left baking in the sun. Since I discovered CeraVe over the winter holidays  my skin has enjoyed the best winter ever. Due to a combination of genetics  allergies and hypothyroidism  I have spent decades trying to find ways in which to get my skin to be human-looking. With the use of CeraVe twice a day  for once  my skin looks normal and almost feels as soft as the skin of others. If your skin is just dry-normal  CeraVe moisturizing cream might be too heavy for you.
3567,barbara,1,27-May-19, ,I’ve been using this for years after my dermatologist recommended it. Feels great. No scent and not greasy
3568,BarbaraJean Honour-Cuebas,0,22-Mar-19, ,Thick floppy and sticky. I don t care what Dermatologist s recommend - your skin will still feel dry & sticky.
3569,Patricia Q,1,27-Jan-18, ,I have always had terribly dry skin in the winter  and I ve never been able to find something that works but is light feeling. This lotion is great! It has kept my hands and face moisturized without feeling heavy or greasy. This jar will last a long time  but I will reorder when it runs out.
3570,Maga loves her grand kids !,1,23-Aug-13,2 people found this helpful,This is a wonder cream (they also sell a regular body lotion). But this is like a spa in a jar. I slather it on while wet from the shower. That locks in moisture. It absorbs nicely  doesn t clog pores and if my sensitive skin loves it  I think anyone can use it. It is fragrance free but still very pleasant as are all the CeraVe products. Best prices I ve found are though Amazon! They carry the full line of CeraVe skin care. I use it all and love it!
3571,Alice Sim,1,03-Aug-16, ,Favorite moisturizer. We have this on subscription because both my husband and I use it. My husband s dermatologist recommended it for him because his skin is so sensitive. He previously could only use oils on his face but now has switched to this. I like it so much that I use it as a body moisturizer and a night time moisturizer for my face and neck.
3572,Shadygrovelady,1,06-Feb-19, ,Have had a lot of issues with bruising and tearing skin on my forearms  trying a 3 pronged approach. This cream  taking collegen powder and drinking more water.. I have had great result so far. Skin seems much better able to withstand bumps without tearing.
3573,Dustin,1,13-Dec-18, ,This is one of the few moisturizes that will do ok on the face as well as body. Very mild. Does not feel oily afterwards. Moisturizes well.
3574,Robert M. Wilson,1,16-Apr-19, ,An LPN told me to use CeraVe several years ago for dry  itchy skin  especially during the winter months. It works.
3575,Michelle,1,15-Jul-18, ,This is the only product I ve found that helps my eczema condition on my hands and arms. This product and immunotherapy (allergy shots) are helping me get my skin back to normal!
3576,ElizabethAP,1,20-Jan-18, ,The absolute best moisturizer I’ve ever used. I’ve had horrible eczema on my face for awhile now and this along with my routine of cerave facial wash and Klairs toner has gotten rid of it. I’m absolutely amazed!
3577,Katie Ananda,1,01-Mar-18, ,This is the best moisturizer. My skin  which is generally very dry  is soft and seems to stay that way  even if I don t use it every day. It has no scent  which is great  because I am very sensitive to fragrances.
3578,Cookbook Crazy,1,16-Mar-16, ,I was very skeptical  but  after being told by my doctor that any lotion that is liquid in form contains alcohol and is therefore DRYING to skin  I decided to give this a try. It does indeed simply disappear into your skin. I d venture to say it s even less greasy than Lubriderm  something I ve used and sworn by for years. And  while I thought I d just use it in winter  assuming it would feel heavier on my skin  I see no reason not use it during the warmer months. If I had to say anything negative  it would be that it doesn t have sunscreen in it as my summer Lubriderm formula does.  Great product.
3579,BusyMom,1,23-Feb-16, ,can t say enough good things about this moisturizing cream. I use it on my face  neck  and all over my body. It is better than much more expensive creams  and I have tried almost all of them. I have recommend this cream to many of my friends  and they equally like it. I would suggest if you buy this 16 oz size to buy a pump to use on the jar. Makes using it much easier.
3580,ATLMAN,1,08-Feb-19, ,Cleared up some dry winter skin within days. Use regularly now. Also compared to Target and Amazon was a better price.
3581,Ashley Donahue,1,05-Aug-17, ,I ve always heard good things about this brand from friends  so I thought I d check it out. I was in need of a general mosturizer  and this really does do the trick! Arms  legs  hands  even dry areas on the face are made smoother and softer with this product.

3584,Elizabeth,1,15-May-19, ,This is really one of a kind product. I used this with my daughter since she has eczema and allergies.
3585,Bird,1,17-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,Wonderful  rich  soothing for sensitive skin. It s a heavy lotion but that s what you need in winter.
3586,Brandi Masters,1,14-May-19, ,Its slightly heavy so it goes a long way. Will keep you moisturized durinf the day and night
3587,shenanigans,1,17-Apr-19, ,Works incredibly well!! Goes on smooth and leaves a silky smooth feeling. It is my favorite moisturizer of all time.
3588,lizan,1,08-Dec-17, ,Absolutely the best for dry skin on my legs. Recommended by my dermatologist..use it after my shower and it totally protects my skin and keeps it smooth. Seals in the moisture and does not have to be re applied .
3589,Bruce,1,23-May-19, ,This cream was recommended by our dermatologist for very dry skin. It is incredibly soothing- and skin feels soft hours after applying
3590,YB,1,10-Jan-18, ,This has absolutely saved my skin this winter! I use it as a facial moisturizer and love it. It does not cause break outs and does not make my skin feeling tight. Many moisturizers cause one of these 2 extremes.
3591,Kelsey,1,02-Dec-18, ,This will be my new daily moisturizing lotion from now on. Glides on and absorbs easily. Leaves skin soft and hydrated. Loving it.
3592,TGarbo,1,22-Jun-19, ,I purchased this for my daughter while she used retin-A to help moisturize he skin. Worked great!
3593,Avid reader,1,09-Dec-18, ,Use this daily on body and face. Recommended to me by my dermatologist. It is soothing and helps with dry skin and rosacea.
3594,Matt,1,02-Jul-19, ,I m new to facial moisturizers but this cream combined with the facial cleanser is incredible. Love the product.
3595,Nicole sebastian,1,19-Dec-18, ,works fantastic! i always have dry gross scaley patches of skin in winter and after one use they disappeared!!! haven t seen any dry skin since and been using it for a week
3596,cheryl a. graves,1,13-Nov-15, ,I was introduced to CeraVe by my nine year old granddaughter. She an I took a girls trip to the beach and she had the CeraVe and she encouraged me to use it. She suggested that it might  help  my wrinkles. She was correct it is helping me every day! Wonderful for all body parts especially dry face skin. It s a five star product in my opinion all because of my sweet granddaughter.
3597,Cheryl Regan,1,14-Mar-18, ,Great for extremely dry skin and Ichthyosis vulgaris. This works the best for this condition and I see great improvements. The skins becomes moist and the scales go away when using daily.
3598,mxeco,1,16-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,The best cream i have ever had
3599,D. Ireland,1,31-Oct-18, ,I like this stuff. I could probably get something better (or maybe not) if I spent a lot more. But this does a great job of hydrating my face.
3600,AhoyMate,1,20-Feb-19, ,Great face moisturizer. Gentle. Non greasy. Definitely provides a lot of hydration for dry thirsty skin.
3601,Somontha Prum,1,23-May-14, ,I saw this stuff at CVS for a high price and decided to buy it online where it definitely is cheaper! This stuff is a staple in my skincare routine and has kept my dry-skin hydrated which is AWESOMEEEEE. It doesn t give a greasy feel at all however can be stinging on your skin if you have really dry skin. In that case  I tend to use Sweet Almond Oil and layer the moisturizing cream and occlusive (vaseline or aquaphor) on top which seals in all the moisture making my face nice and plump! I would recommend this to anyone as a staple in their daily skincare routines!!
3602,denni munro,1,08-Mar-19, ,Amazing cream  I put it on at night and my skin is soft and subtle in the morning I use it everyday
3603,WokeUp,1,14-Dec-17, ,The awful winter flu of 2017 left my skin greenish  dry  and hurting with the slightest touch and with the wind blowing. I used this as my recovery cream and my skin got better in a few weeks. No more hurting. Fast forward a few months and I am even getting compliments about my skin. It is now my maintenance cream. I don t bother with eye cream anymore - I use this wherever it is needed. This is really good value for money and I wish I had known about this sooner. Works well under makeup.
3604,John L. Johann,1,10-Jun-14,One person found this helpful,I have tried many brands but CeraVe is best by far. It actually works! And especially for itchy skin. Fragrance is subtle but pleasing. That was feedback from my wife. She uses it now because it leaves the her skin soft as well. You can put gobs on after a shower before bed and it absorbs quickly and is not messy. This was a godsend years ago. I had a skin condition that drove me crazy with an incessant itch. No more. Thanks to CeraVe and the physician who suggested its use.
3605,go quilt,1,02-Jul-19, ,This cream was recommended by my dermatologist It does the job for my dryer skin
3606,CO book lover!,1,02-Apr-15,One person found this helpful,This was a great deal for some awesome creme! CeraVe is a trusted  dermatologist-recommended brand of medium-thickness creme  perfect for the Winter months  or if you live in a dry climate. This is usable on both kids and adults  and great for sensitive skin  as many of us have. Try this is get soft  healthy skin year round - I highly recommend it!
3607,Shabuki,1,19-May-19, ,Used it for over five years  great moisturizer for severe dry skin. Makes skin feel great
3608,EGH923,1,06-Feb-19, ,This is a highly rated (as it should be) moisturizing cream. If you have dry and/or flaky skin  this is for you.
3609,LORRIE F,1,16-Jun-16, ,This stuff is awesome. My husband s dermatologist recommended CeraVe  and it is even better than the Cetaphil previously recommended by derm several years back. A little goes a long way  so don t let price deter you from trying it... Instantly absorbs  no residue and non-greasy. So far the best moisturizer we ve tried.
3610,Ranelle Randles,1,19-Jun-19, ,If you like an effective  but non greasy cream that absorbs immediately  this is for you. No smell which is nice.
3611,B,1,03-Dec-17, ,I highly recommend CeraVe moisturizing cream. I have severe eczema and sensitive skin. After trying multiple similar products  is the only one I have had success. It keeps my skin hydrated for the entire day. It also improves dry skin as well as rashes. I use the moisturizing cream daily.
3612,Augustus,1,02-Jul-19, ,I use this to moisturize my face and it helps my face not produce so much oil from being dried out.
3613,Amazon Customer,1,24-Jan-19, ,This stuff is a game changer. I have highly sensitive  very Irish  combination skin. Everything makes me break out. I use this to shave and as a moisturizer and my skin has never looked or felt better. I LOVE this product!
3614,Amazon Customer,1,17-May-18, ,The best lotion I found for my eczema outbreaks! Perfect for everyday maintenance and I use it as facial lotion too. My toddler nephew uses it for his skin irritations as well.
3615,Elj,1,07-Jun-19, ,Have used this for years and will always use it. Amazing hydration  great value.
3616,Carol M. Mann,1,19-Jun-17, ,My dermatologist recommended CeraVe years ago  and I have been using it ever since. I use it daily on my face  arms and legs because my skin is quite dry. I usually don t like creams on my skin because they feel greasy but not CeraVe. I also like it because it is fragrant free. I highly recommend the  moisturizing cream .
3617,Velasquez,1,21-Jun-19, ,First time using this lotion and we love it. We bought it to moisturize our baby and toddlers skin. It s has been great. Even for adult it does not leave the skin sticky or oily. Highly recommended and will be buying it again.
3618,M. Ruffin,0,19-May-19, ,Not effective for my eczema or sun allergies. I’ll keep trying other products.
3619,Shopper,1,15-Jan-19, ,This is not at all sticky and keeps my skin soft all day. I m very picky and would recommend this to anyone with scaly skin.
3620,Knittermam,1,20-May-19, ,Used this with heel sleeves to soften hard and dry cracked heels. Great product.
3621,hind,0,03-Feb-19, ,I received the cream today but it has a very strong smell that is very comparable to hair bleach. I was wonder if that’s how it should smell and if it’s safe to use. I tried it on my hands and the smell don’t go away at all.
3622,Margo N. King-Battles,1,26-Jul-17, ,Love this cream for my daughters eczema! I ve been using for a year now and mixing 1/2 and 1/2 with Eucerin ointment. Her skin loves it and it actually makes her rough skin feel baby soft! We apply 3-4 times per day and anytime she is feeling dry
3623,Sofi,1,26-Oct-15, ,This moisturizer has made a big difference for my dry patches. They were getting really noticeable under foundation so I realized my old moisturizer wasn t doing the job. This one feels great and sinks in really well creating a satin finish but I would not recommend it right before makeup. Use a lighter moisturizer before makeup. Granted I also used primer when I tried this under makeup so it s worth a try on its own.
3624,Nate,1,07-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,it puts the lotion on its skin or it gets the hose again.

3627,Al G,1,22-Sep-16,One person found this helpful,Ive got eczema and ive worked in a dermatology clinic for many years. This stuff is the real deal and moisturizes without the oily feeling. There is a reason why it is so expensive...because it really works. Remember  to prevent moisture in the skin  moisturize within 3min when you get out of the shower.
3628,Stuart,1,16-Oct-18, ,The product should have a spay pump  not just a top  had to use the pump from my other container  The product works great especially for dry skin.
3629,ginger,1,06-May-14, ,Just a simple moisturizing glycerin hand cream that is quiickly absorbed... and the pump sold on Amazon Matrix Biolage 16 oz jar pump is the perfect fit. Unscented. Put this on your hands  rubbing around fingernails and maybe under fingernails and go work in the garden. When it s time to clean up all the dirt just washes right off. It also makes hands really smooth.  Click to open expanded view  Matrix Biolage 16 Oz Jar Pump
3630,Shannonroz,1,10-Aug-15, ,I love all Cerave products. They don t irritate my skin or cause breakouts. I use this when my skin is overly dry and it works wonders. I d suggest to only use at night if you have oily skin. It can cause a shine to your face if you use in the morning due to the thicker nature and ingredients in the product. For morning use  I d suggest the Cerave Moisturizing lotion.
3631,AC,1,05-Jun-19, ,I have used this for years. No break-outs. No perfume scent if you are sensitive.
3632,CParks,1,30-Mar-16,One person found this helpful,I love this moisturizer! It has a consistency of mayo that I normally avoid in creams but it rubs in well and doesn t feel greasy... if you give it a minute to soak in. I have exceptionally dry skin and this is the only product I have used in my life that doesn t either burn  feel sticky  stink or is cost prohibitive. I buy it over and over. I did cheat once and purchased the big box store brand look alike. BIG mistake. Unless you like smearing shortening on your legs......
3633,car wife,1,14-Mar-19, ,Got this for my mom at her doctor’s suggestion. She loves it. Definitely helps her dry skin. Great price.
3634,China1951,1,28-Mar-19, ,Really like this product. I’ve noticed a difference in my face and neck in just two weeks.

3636,Rusty Gear,1,24-Mar-16, ,You get alot of moisturizing power for the money! its thick and creamy  a bit on the heavy side  really does moisturize hey thats what you want dont you!! you also dont need to use alot  a little dab here a little dab there. For the ladies if you gonna use it in the mornings before applying makeup use very little and drink more water lol.
3637,Russell B. Poole,1,07-Dec-18, ,My wife had me purchase this after a friend recommended it to her. She says  it’s the best cream ever .

3639,FusionG,1,09-Sep-18, ,Excellent lotion for dry skin. My favorite thing about it is that it does not leave a greasy residue. Would highly recommend!
3640,Amazon Customer,1,26-Jan-16,One person found this helpful,Got this on a doctors recommendation for extremely dry skin. It works well  as long as I apply it as I was directed (to slightly damp skin  e.g. When I lightly towel off after a shower- not sopping wet). It goes a lot further when applied to damp skin  too. I found it to have a Mild  pleasant smell. Not overpowering at all.
3641,Tanmoy Baidya,1,10-Feb-17,One person found this helpful,Best cure for a very dry and chapped skin! Tried several other creams but this seems to work better for me.I prefer the jar over the pump one because it gets messy towards the end with the pumping one.
3642,Amazon Customer,1,21-Nov-14,One person found this helpful,My husband has in grown hairs on his arms which create bumps. The dermatologist recommended this cream to help exfoliate and moisturize. I have used it for my hands as well. I am impressed with how well it moisturizes and yet it feels very lightweight. A lot of lotions are greasy and this one definitely is not. My husband even has softer arms with fewer bumps.
3643,Mary,0,11-Jan-19, ,Do not like it at all. I’m using it for foot cream. Makes my face feel dry and I don’t like the smell.
3644,Sonia Foster,1,15-Apr-18, ,Love it. My face got exposed to too much vinegar in my face mask which lleft it red and dry. One applucation soothed it. My face feels great with my daily moisturizing routine.
3645,Bri,1,16-Apr-18, ,I use it daily on my face  sometimes twice daily. LOVE this product. Hydrates well and goes on thick enough but also dried quickly. My second jar and I would purchase again.

Your results may be different. And this is a lot cheaper then most prescription drugs.

I am 62 and very fair and this is amazing on my whole body even works on your face as a night cream. I gave it to my 91 year old friend and she used it on her face and she looked way younger. It also works well on older people with onion skin that tears easily.

3687,CindyJoi,1,21-May-19, ,It is so thick and luxurious feeling. My skin loves it!
3688,Joy L. Getha,1,16-Jun-16, ,My husband and I have lived in dry climates for over 20 years. This is the best moisturizing cream we have ever found. It does not feel greasy  it just feels so good  you will wonder how you ever lived without it. It does not have any perfume or fragrance  which some people find irritating.
3689,lauren olsen,1,15-May-19, ,Absolutely love...doesnt leave u feeling oily...and works great
3690,Michelle Abrahamsen,1,22-Jan-19, ,Great Purchase! It’s great for dry skin during the winter months or anytime.
3691,georgie,1,30-Nov-18, ,this was a moisturizing cream for for my face and i love it and the fast shipping thank u
3692,Van D.,0,30-Mar-18, ,This cream doesn t pack a big punch as Gold Bond cream  it doesn t hydrate you as well. It is a bit oily. This is definitely not for winter. For winter  you would need something as strong as the Gold Bond ones.
3693,Femi,1,24-Jun-17, ,I use this moisturizer with my kids. We all love it! I have seen my husband sneak to use it too...lol. He is usually does use any skin product la that does not have  men  written on it. But he like this one. :-D
3694,PHuh,1,27-Jul-18, ,Wife loved these :) They re light on the face and perfect for putting on at night before bed time. Wake up to really good looking skin :)
3695,Robert C Jeschke,1,04-May-19, ,Works great on my skin I break out with most but this is great
3696,Abou Fall,1,31-Jul-14, ,Found out about this cream from a TV show. Purchased it over a year ago for my very very dry skin. I love it and find that it last well into the day and does not leave me feeling greasy or oily. A little goes a long way and if you use it right after the shower when the skiing is still damp it last even longer. I think it actually traps some of the moisture of the shower. I recommend this purchase.
3697,J Sanchez,1,28-Feb-18, ,Recommend by my dermatologist. Really helps with dry skin. A small bit goes a long way. Not greasy. No scent. Also try the body wash. Great product line.
3698,A.C.,1,18-Feb-14, ,This is my body moisturizer for the winter months. My skin can become very itchy when dry and this keeps it hydrated for more than 24 hrs. My boyfriend who suffers from eczema also has success with this moisturizer  however  he is required to apply it twice daily. My only issue with this is the slight tackiness it leaves on the skin for a few minutes post application.  Tried this on my face for a few months  and it just didn t work out. Yes  it did hydrate my skin and didn t cause breakouts  but it was not a replacement for my HG face moisturizer.
3699,Shauna hancock,0,14-Aug-18, ,I was really looking forward to using this but someone had opened the plastic packaging around the container and lid was not all the way on so it got everywhere..
3700,Mimi,1,26-Dec-18, ,Great product. None greasy. Goes under makeup Ether than any other product that I have used.

3710,KPal19,1,10-Sep-17, ,Awesome light every day moisturizer. I have eczema and I think regular use of this really helps keep away eczema flare ups. I use it right when I get out of the shower and my skin is slightly damp.
3711,Laura de Sosa,1,10-Feb-17,One person found this helpful,Recommended by my dermatologist. I tried many lotions and creams and even prescription medications for my eczema without success until I tried this cream. I been free of eczema for about one year now.

3714,Heather Ramsey,1,15-May-19, ,Best stuff even for sensitive skin. No fragrance
3715,Hot Chocolate Connisseur,1,28-Feb-16,One person found this helpful,This is by far the very best lotion on the market. My husband has diabetic feet complete with calluses. This product helped to rid his feet of those calluses and provides a level of protectant we have never been able to find in any other product.
3716,Kieu Nguyen,1,04-Feb-18, ,I love CeraVe cream  it absorbs your skin deeply and last long for a whole day  it makes your skin smoothly  not oily like most other creams. It is no  woman smell  as my husband said so he likes to use it.

3718,The Wood Man,1,06-Jul-18, ,This is my third order of this cream. Recommended by my dermatologist. A bit expensive  but does a better job than most.

3721,Nerdy girl,1,05-Jun-19, ,I use this every single day and it keeps my skin very soft and smooth.
3722,LPLoveland,1,05-Aug-15, ,We live in a very dry climate. My dermatologist recommended this product with its protective qualities. I like to use it on my skin after showering. It continues to moisturize for some time after application. I ve purchased a number of jars and continue to like it. No smell  which is nice for those who have sensitivities to perfume.
3723,Angel,1,21-Jun-18, ,This far the best buy I ve made in a skincare product in years. My skin was cracked and dry. I had used many other expensive skincare products with no success. I saw immediate results. I d definitely buy again.
3724,Elizabeth Roberts- Berg,1,24-Apr-19, ,I have had dry skin my entire life and this works great!
3725,Sarah,1,29-Aug-14,2 people found this helpful,I was afraid to use moisturizer for a long time because my skin gets oily so soon after cleaning  but I started to get dry skin flaking off my nose so I took the dive. I do not regret it at all. It doesn t feel greasy  actually it makes my face feel really clean. I can t go without it now. My skin feels so much smoother and no flakes!
3726,Steph,0,09-Jan-19, ,I love CeraVe and use regularly  but what I recieved has a different smell (not a good one) and a slightly different texture than normal. I went to the store  bought a tub and compared. I suspect what I recieved is not authentic.
3727,JPL1958,1,25-Jan-19, ,Love this body cream! It was recommended by my dermatologist & it is my favorite!

3730,Amazon Customer,1,17-Apr-18, ,Best nighttime moisturizer. Holy grail for me for years. Don’t use during the day if you have oily skin though. But great for intensive nighttime hydration!
3731,My shopping experience......,1,29-Apr-19, ,My dermatologist recommended this cream. --- I like it.
3732,A. Madrid,1,05-Jan-17, ,My son had rough skin regardless of all the lotions  creams and bath soaks we tried. I purchased this cream and after the very first use my son s rough skin was so much softer. I started using on my feet and have seen a dramatic difference.
3733,E. Tilley,1,21-Sep-14, ,Love love LOVE this lotion. It s is very CREAMY. Not oily... Creamy. Use it on my children and my face all the time. They have very dry  sensitive skin  as do I  and it has beaten every other lotion I ve bought for hydration purposes... Even the ones that claim a 24-hr hydration period. (CeraVe is not comparable to petrolatum products since it is a hydrant and not a coating agent). It is wonderful. No distinguishable scent makes my migraine-prone brain very happy too.
3734,Khing N.,1,14-May-17, ,My son has eczema  which we have tried all kind of cream  sebamed  aquaphor  any kind that you can name it  but none works. Until we find CeraVe. It helps keep his skin moisture but not gressy. Best cream ever for his skin.
3735,Shawn Nelson,1,08-Oct-15, ,My dermatologist recommended this as the best moisturizing cream  he said to buy it as it was inexpensive enough to use a lot to moisturize my aging skin. It has helped. Because it is not oil based it does not clog the pores. It is think  creamy  and does not feel sticky or smear onto my glasses  all pluses in my book.
3736,Mark D.,1,07-Jun-18, ,I have trouble with cracks on my fingers  and this product helps me a lot. I use it every night for soft  smooth hands.
3737,Cristina,1,20-Mar-19, ,Delivered on time and product was sealed very well.
3738,Courtney B.,1,05-Oct-16,One person found this helpful,We use this for our dry colorado winters and even summers! They help keep itching at a distance  super creamy and highly recommended to us from our dermatologist! Would buy again for sure!
3739,Wilma Martinez,1,09-Sep-16, ,this is the best body cream for every one; excellent and I have been using it for  at least  3 years; your skin never be the same  actually; my dermatology recommended it two years ago and I never took her advise but after the first time with CeraVe I keep it for ever
3740,Ginny Hebert,1,06-Jul-18, ,My very favorite moisturizing cream. It is odorless which is what is important to me. I also have very sensitive skin and this cream is perfect for my skin.
3741,ML Swartz,1,13-Nov-18, ,I always like to use the cream instead of lotion because it gets deeper into my skin and completely turns my dry legs into smooth to the touch legs.
3742,Michelle,1,04-Jun-16, ,Great lotion for sensitive skin that was recommended by my dermatologist. Helped clear up an area of hypersensitive skin (pretty sure it s eczema but not yet diagnosed). Got the larger jar for about the same price as the smaller jar in stores. Definitely recommend for sensitive skin.
3743,Diablita,1,02-Jun-18, ,Recommended by my dermatologist for my super dry  very sensitive skin  this works. Moisturizes deeply and can be used head to toe.
3744,Burrows,1,07-Jun-18, ,A godsend for my super dry skin. I apply daily after my shower and it goes on thick but soaks in right away and isn’t greasy at all. Love it
3745,Joyce B.,1,14-Nov-18, ,Bought this for my Mom who is Diabetic. Her skin is very dry and this has helped her.
3746,Ms T,1,29-Jan-19, ,This is the product recommended to me by a dermatologist years ago. Only thing that works for my eczema.
3747,Amazon Customer,1,09-Jan-17, ,This tub is huge and worth it for the price you pay. It s going to last me for a really long time. This doesn t break me out. I use this as the last layer of my skincare to seal everything in. It doesn t seem to absorb into the skin however. It leaves a matte finish  which is great because I layer my skincare and my face will be super shiny without this on top.
3748,Amazon Customer,1,20-Oct-17, ,I will never switch unless somebody comes up with exactly the same cream but with natural ingredients. My dermatologist recommended this moisturizer to me since it doesn’t clog pores and I have acne prone skin that I’ve been struggling with since I was 13. All other moisturizers I’ve tried were too heavy and greasy for my skin but this works wonderfully. I use it on my face and body and this tub lasted me about a year!
3749,SusanKnows,1,30-Jun-18, ,This cream is very heavy and thick yet absorbs quickly. Great product and Amazon Prime makes shopping so easy!

3755,nenna,1,26-Oct-13,One person found this helpful,For me this was recommended by my dermatologist and she was right. Lush cream not greasy  goes on smooth  doesn t stink of the place either. Even my husband doesn t mind it on his hands after he helps with the back. After I have worn it a couple of days my skin is silky  smooth and doesn t not itch. I see why it s called luxury cream with out the luxury price. I really like it.
3756,DKK,1,17-Apr-18, ,This is an great moisturizer soaks in well and makes your skin feel super. It is also reasonably priced. No need to pay more.
3757,Nichole,1,13-Sep-16, ,I bought this at Sam s Club originally because it was a great price and I needed a thicker winter moisturizer. When my dad can to visit me he wanted to try this out & he loved it. This is the only place that I can find it even close to Sam s Clubs price.
3758,Rebecca Miller,1,19-Oct-16,One person found this helpful,Love it. Best moisturizer ever for someone who has suffered from eczema and severely dry skin her whole life. Better than eucerin  goes on lighter and lasts longer.
3759,Kimberly,1,23-Mar-17,4 people found this helpful,So this is the best cream I have ever used  and I have used them all! This holds true for CeraVe products entirely though. I have sensitive skin and detest the oily feel some creams leave behind. I even use this cream on my face at night  because even though it is thick  it someone all soaks up and leaves me all glowy and non-greasy for bed. I LOVE LOVE LOVE This product  I have it on subscribe and save so I get a new one every month. I find the subscribe and save makes me commit to using it more than I normally would (after showers  before bed  after sun). Makes my body and face feel amazing!!
3760,kalea,1,03-Jun-18, ,Love this cream. Soaks in super fast and doesn’t clog up pores. Very silky. Makes my skin feel brand new vs. 60 and sun fried.
3761,B-Happy,1,05-Nov-17, ,First time using this product and it s works great!! My skin is so soft after using this and stays moisturized for hours. It s the best thing out there. Love it. I ordered another jar.
3762,Bob,1,11-Jun-18, ,dermatologist told my wife to buy this brand and he was correct this is what she needed to battle excessive dry skin
3763,GMaria,1,20-Mar-17, ,I use this on my face  and so far this is the only moisturizer I can get away with using without having a reaction. Pretty mild and simple and affordable price. One tub lasts me a year just using it on my face..
3764,Joanne T. Johnson,1,26-Jun-18, ,I didn t realize the jar was as large as it was but still love the cream inside. Will take me a while to use it.
3765,Shoptastic Shopper,1,12-Oct-18, ,Great product for anyone that needs to hydrate after a shower. Fewer eczemas flares.
3766,Amazon Customer,1,07-Jul-18, ,Great moisturizer! Recommended to me by my daughter! Smells and feels great on the skin. Kina feels like your skin drinks it. Perfect for under make up! The jar is huge! Definitely worth the price!
3767,Savingdogs,1,05-May-17,4 people found this helpful,I bought this product because I had recent skin cancer treatment and needed something really moisturizing and also recommended by a doctor. Wow! I will always buy this product forevermore. Where have you been all my life? Seriously works for my dry flaky skin and I have tried everything. I had resorted to using mostly coconut oil (plain) because so many additives and ingredients are irritating to my skin or nose. But not this product and it sinks into my skin much nicer than coconut oil. Thank you CeraVe for making such a nice product and thank you to my dermatologist for recommending it.
3768,A E Hendrix,1,29-Jul-14,One person found this helpful,I love this cream! I was first introduced to CeraVe by my daughter-in-law; I had a severe cracking and bleeding issue on the backs of both of my hands for weeks. We went to visit my son and his wife  and she bought me a 16oz jar of CeraVe to try. It worked immediately!!! My hands were soothed  my discomfort erased  and the healing started immediately. Within 2 days of my first use  the cracking was completely gone. I have been able to maintain a soft texture on my hands. Love this stuff!
3769,CFam,1,01-Dec-14, ,This cream is amazing! I bought it to use on the rough/dry patches on my toddler son s legs that I thought would never clear up. A friend told me her daughter s eczema cleared up within a couple days  so that is why I decided to buy. Sure enough  within a few days of use  my son s legs are much smoother. It is definitely worth the money and I would buy again.
3770,Sandra P.,1,04-Apr-18, ,Purchased for my elderly Mom as her doctor recommended it for her skin and the price was better then what I could find in stores.
3771,MOJO,1,09-Apr-19, ,Best cream for dry skin. Recommended by skin dr.

3776,Sandy,1,25-Feb-17, ,The best stuff I have ever used. I heard that ceramides were the best for dry skin and I bought this. Within a few days the difference was amazing..really rejuvenated my dry patchy skin. I will buy this forever!
3777,ce,1,02-May-19, ,Fantastic product. It hydrates and soothes the skin.
3778,Frank Kennedy,1,02-Nov-17, ,Recommended by my dermatologist. I use as substitute for CeraMax which is ungodly expensive in comparison. CeraVe does nearly the same job at a fraction of the price.
3779,Kelsie Tregilgas,1,13-Jan-15, ,This moisturizer really works for me. It is not half as expensive as other products I have tried and it makes my skin sooo much happier. I ordered a pump-top to go with it so I don t have a bunch of bacteria growing inside as it takes a good while to go through it  even with liberal use. Unless my skin changes its mind  this is my moisturizer for life.
3780,GBS,1,07-Jul-15, ,My Dermatologist recommended this for a serious dry skin problem on my lower legs I ve been battling for years with at least a dozen different moisturizing creams...nothing ever worked. Since he told me about this two weeks ago  I apply it morning and night  and no longer HAVE a dry skin problem. As far as I am concerned  it is MAGIC!
3781,blessed grandma,1,13-Mar-12,2 people found this helpful,I bought Cerave Cream for a friend whose little boy  almost three-years old  has suffered with eczema since very young. She was reluctant to give him the steroids recommended by her doctor because of his age and her fear of steroids. She used this cream for about two weeks and the results were much better than anything she has used previously. The cream applies easily  is quickly absorbed  is not oily and gives quick results.
3782,Thena Smith,1,15-Jan-19, ,Noticed the difference immediately. Yesterday my trainer noticed my arms: I m sure  your arms no longer look like the Sahara Desert  was intended as a compliment...lol
3783,Cynthia Dagnal-Myron,1,22-Apr-15, ,I love being able to get my favorite moisturizing cream  prescribed by my doctor after a near-fatal illness that ravaged my skin  for a great price! CeraVe is a miracle elixir  but it s very expensive and that keeps lots of people who really need if from being able to try it. I ve found it here for a few dollars less  and I m thrilled!
3784,TheLastLeprechaun,1,02-Jul-19, ,My go to cream for body and any dry spots.

3786,Anon,1,16-Jan-14, ,I had eczema and little bumps on my arms (chicken skin). Dermatologists have suggested so many different products over the years  but I decided to pick this one on my own after seeing Amazon reviews. I could have saved myself years and lots of money if I had only discovered this sooner. It works wonderfully and makes my skin incredibly soft. My secret: use it after the shower and mix in body oil (I m using almond oil right now) and you will wake up with the most gorgeous skin!
3787,1austinreader,1,04-Jun-18, ,Excellent body moisturizer. Prevents alligator skin all winter. Have never found anything more effective for similar price

3789,hammama,1,12-Jan-15, ,My kids have eczema. Have tried: Aveeno  Eucerin  California Baby  Shikai  Aquaphor  and Hydrolatum. This beats them all hands down. Absorbs instantly  non-greasy  kids can put their clothes on right away. Best part? It has kept the eczema at bay better than any of the other lotions we ve tried. My kids no longer need any steroid cream as long as we use this lotion twice a day. Love it!
3790,Rob Wil,1,03-May-19, ,Great value for the amount and price. My dermatologist office recommended it for use.
3791,El Jag,1,06-Mar-19, ,good for bumpy skin  a bit pricey tho

3793,Susan K.,1,25-Aug-14, ,I absolutely love this cream!! I have tried others but they do not measure up to this product. I do not like to apply lotion or cream and feel sticky or slippery afterward. This product absorbs completely even though it is a cream. I have very dry skin and it works wonders. My dermatologist recommended CeraVe to me a few years ago and I have been using it ever since.
3794,Bobby Chastain,1,17-Dec-18, ,I was in the drug store business for 14 years and dermatologist & pharmacist use this product for a lot of stuff they do. good item.
3795,Rachel H.,1,04-Jun-17, ,My son had/has a horrible eczema. This cream has helped him tremendously! I put some on myself too :). I like this product a little more than cetaphil. Just the texture of it. I would buy this again!
3796,Ally K,1,23-Apr-17, ,I had read online reviews that said this was a quality moisturizer. I have normal to dry generally clear skin and I wanted something that simply felt great on my face and this does the trick! Goes on smoothly  my skin soaks it right up. No side effects. Great price - a little goes a long way!
3797,R. Wilson,1,17-Aug-18, ,The BEST skin cream on the market. My skin is better than it has been my entire life. I love that it has hyralaunic acid.

3799,Not So Secret Shopper,1,16-Apr-17, ,Excellent cream. Non-greasy  all-day moisture . I have very sensitive skin with patches of eczema from head to toe. This cream isn t sticky even in hot  humid weather. This stuff really works.
3800,Steven M.,1,23-Sep-18, ,An excellent product...especially for very dry skin. I find it to be far superior to products like Eucerin.

3805,M.,1,18-Nov-13,One person found this helpful,Has absolutely saved my skin in our very dry climate. I started using it on my face a few months ago because NOTHING else was keeping the flakes away. This works beautifully  though I still have to put a few drops of argon oil on. As for my body  I have not been getting eczema like I used to  which is so fantastic. So glad they finally developed lotions like this!
3806,Sarah W,1,15-Feb-18, ,Super moisturizing and doesn t cause breakouts. I m 40+  use this cream on my face nightly  and my skin has never looked better.

3808,Dotty Quade,1,10-Apr-18, ,I have extremely sensitive skin and it is difficult to find anything that doesn’t irritate my skin or clog pores/cause breakouts.  This is thick and creamy  but not greasy. I use it on my face daily.
3809,B Coop,1,26-Jun-18, ,A very good moisturizer  be careful as a little goes a long ways. This was recommended by my Dermatologist.
3810,Amanda Cervantes,1,24-Feb-18, ,This moisturizing cream has made a noticeable improvement on my diabetic elderly parents’ skin. They have tried other creams but none have worked as well as CeraVe. Thank you so much for your wonderful cream.
3811,Gabrielle W.,1,18-Jun-18, ,I keep this cream in the refrigerator  and this cream is very effective in moisturizing my skin.
3812,Michele LaRocco,1,28-May-18,One person found this helpful,Thick white cream that is double or triple the density of the lotion. Full of good ingredients for skin. Like a body butter but better (that was fun). Anyway my skin is happy when I use it.
3813,Lisa Kearns,1,29-May-12,3 people found this helpful,I m middle aged  and have dry skin that needs some kind of moisturizer. My hands and feet are especially prone to drying and cracking if I don t remember to apply moisturizer. I ve used every kind of lotion and body butter out there  but hadn t found the one I really loved. My sister told me about CeraVe Moisturizing Cream  and I m so glad I tried it.  I apply this cream at night  right before bed. It absorbs quickly  and leaves my skin hydrated and soft  and the effect lasts 24 hours (except on my hands  due to washing them). It s made a big difference in the skin on my arms and legs  bringing back the skin I had in my 30s. For my feet  I use Theraplex FT every other night  as they need more than even CeraVe can deliver.  I like that CeraVe soaks in quickly and that it comes in a big container that lasts me a month or more. I don t have sensitive skin or allergies  so I don t have to be careful about ingredients  but CeraVe is free of dyes and perfumes  and it s noncomedogenic (it won t block pores).  THIS is the moisturizer I ve been looking for. I ll continue to buy and use CeraVe as long as they make it.
3814,Robin Holstein,1,14-Aug-15, ,The husband and I use this  on recommendation of our dermatologist  to help with our skin conditions. He has psoriasis and I have eczema. This is a heavy moisturizing cream. It is great  but heavy. It especially helps us during the dry months of winter. With regular use we have fewer issues of cracking and sore hands.
3815,Ashe_Actual,1,06-Jul-18, ,Worth the price! CeraVe moisturizes amazingly without being heavy or greasy and is great for all skin types.
3816,jeutori samuel,1,30-Jun-19, ,I can definitely tell the quality difference between this moisturizer as opposed to others. I can tell the difference it makes on my skin. My skin skills smoother and healthier

3823,Cinderella,1,01-Jul-15, ,How many extravagant and expensive lotions and potions have I tried over my 50+ years? I ordered this cream for my elderly mother s very dry skin on the recommendation of a caregiver but I got two jars so kept one for myself to try. OMG! Seriously the best  smoothest  most lasting hydrating skin cream I have EVER used. It goes on my body every day  my face morning and night and I am soft  smooth and supple with no lotion odor to interfere with my perfume. I LOVE it!! And by the way  Mom s skin is amazingly better with daily use! Try it!!!

3826,KATHY C,1,06-Feb-17, ,This was recommended by my doctor. It s an extremely effective moisturizing cream. I have very dry skin and some psoriasis and it seems to be helping it. I have only been using it for a few months but am very satisfied with the results.
3827,Andrew Schonbek,1,10-Jun-13, ,Is truly brilliant. And she s the one who recommended this stuff.  In the past I ve slathered on all manner of various and sundry slime  and none of it really made a difference.  This stuff is another story - you can almost see your skin take on a flush of health and a sheen of youth within a few days of beginning to use it. No skin affliction has a chance.  Highly recommended.

3859,Mom of Boys,1,05-Dec-12,One person found this helpful,I tried so many different types of lotion but none held a candle to CeraVe. My son s pediatrician recently diagnosed him with eczema (he s one) and she recommended this brand. I m so glad she did because it s the only lotion/cream that has worked thus far. The rash is not completely gone but I ve never seen it smooth out this much; it doesn t have that  angry  red look anymore. However  I did notice that when I didn t use this product for a few days his rash went right back to looking angry and bumpy again. I will continue to use this product.
3860,K.C. Pronto,1,18-Apr-19, ,The only thing that quells my eczema

This is has helped us keep their skin moisturized  without them feeling like grease. We were using Aquaphor before and that was a mess. But this works much better  without the mess!
3865,CBack,1,13-Jun-18, ,I really like this lotion because it isn t messy (not oily)  does the job and is easy to put on.

3868,M rux,1,04-Oct-17, ,This is a great cream for people who are sensitive to different products. It really does help bring life back to skin that has been dried out.
3869,Lauren,1,14-Mar-16, ,Perfect thickness face lotion for nighttime use  or anytime I need a good dose of moisture (after the beach  the pool  or doing anything harsh to my face like exfoliating). It s not greasy  doesn t smell weird  doesn t leave marks on my sheets or clothing. This lotion suits my needs perfectly. Only downside: no SPF  but I wasn t expecting it.
3870,Peter,1,02-Apr-19, ,Great product and transaction!

3872,Fred H,1,24-Nov-14, ,There are limited places CeraVe is available in this area  was glad to see it on Amazon Prime. Though a bit more expensive than  similar  products  most everyone who have tried it seems to think that it works better than any other skin moisturizer available over-the-counter (without a prescription). Arrived on time as promised.
3873,Amazon Customer,1,30-Oct-18, ,This cream is so gentle and moisturize! Highly recommended. All age can use.

I can t stand the feel of lotions on me if they feel greasy or if I can basically feel it at all. So when a friend recommended this  I was skeptical  yet desperate. CereVe has been awesome! My skin stopped peeling  and I m not itchy everywhere. It surpassed my expectations.
3877,kristen,1,12-May-19, ,Helped my daughters extremely dry skin quickly. Will keep using this.
3878,Amazon Customer,1,14-Jul-17, ,Recommend by our dermatologist so we have used it for over a year. Keep using it and it really will help dry skin. You don t use much of it at a time and Amazon has a great price.

3884,Jensciorty,0,24-Jan-18, ,It feels like a great moisturizer but I do not like the way make up settles on my face with this lotion. It s almost as if the lotion doesn t absorb well into the skin so foundation appears more caked on.

I had done some research and found several dermatologist recommendations for moisturizers with ceramides  which are contained herein. I m hoping with daily use it will help her skin. It absorbs fairly quickly and has little or no scent.
3891,oma,1,15-May-19, ,Favorite lotion and best for the price!
3892,Cortney Thomas,1,08-Apr-16,2 people found this helpful,My skin has never felt more plump and moisturized. I use this cream daily after cleansing to return any moisture to my skin that I ve stripped away  and even hours after applying it  my face retains moisture without appearing oily. If you already have oily skin  however  I would suggest applying the cream when your face is wet. This will result in you using slightly less than you normally would  but achieving the same result. I ve used this daily for about 2 months and I still have about 3/4 left (and I ve used it about 10 times all over my body). If you use it solely on your face  you ll probably get about 8-10 months out of it or 4-6 if you use it on your whole body. A word of caution: For about the first 2-3 weeks of using this cream I noticed a slight increase in my acne  but this irritation has since disappeared.  Update as of 7/12/16 I m still working on that first jar and it is still loving my skin. I ve noticed the more I use the worse my acne gets. I believe it might be clogging my pores when I don t think it out with water first  so I ve started only using it in a small dollop when my face is wet and it has been a wonderful treat!
3893,Dissapointed,1,24-Jan-19, ,Good stuff. Does what it supposed to do.
3894,Frederick L. Ashworth,1,29-Mar-17, ,Having a terrible time with my skin; years of neglect. This is by far the best I have ever used.. It is non-sticky and no smell. If you have dry skin  this should be the trick.
3895,Michelle,1,30-Dec-15,One person found this helpful,A dermatologist recommended this product to me. I always have horribly dry skin in the winter  especially my legs and this stuff works great! Love that it is not scented. Would definitely recommend!

This product is non-irritating and really improves the look and feel of my skin. I have tried some other over the counter products such as Amlactin (caused a rash) and Cetaphil (not as effective). I will be ordering this product again.
3918,SistaBNYC,1,24-Feb-14, ,I like this cream for my feet  hands and elbows. It s a little thick as a facial cream but works wonders on the other areas. To eliminate dry  scaly feet I just soak them in warm water for about 15 minutes  shake off the water without drying with a towel and slathering on the CeraVem followed by warm socks. Overnight  the difference is pretty obvious.

3924,Ariel,1,27-Jan-14,2 people found this helpful,This stuff is great in the Wintertime! My Dermatologist told me to use creams in the Wintertime & lotions during the rest of the year. CeraVe can be used anywhere on the body; from the face to the heels. It is non-comedogenic (it won t clog pores) & non-irritating. It s non-greasy and my sensitive skin doesn t react to it  even when applied near my eyes. The ceramides are  fats  or lipids which nourish the skin  have anti-aging effects  they help treat spider veins  they revive collagen levels  help restore moisture & soothe skin inflammation. The hyaluronic acid creates a protective barrier against harsh Winter winds while helping your skin retain moisture by preventing H20 loss  aids tissue repair & promoting collagen and elastin. The water-retaining nature of hyaluronic acid causes a plumping of the skin which helps give the appearance of wrinkles disappearing. Additionally  CeraVe uses a controlled-release technology which slowly releases nourishing moisture to the skin throughout the day. Most moisturizers don t offer this. One application & I m good for the day! My oily  acne-prone skin has much less aggravation when I use this stuff. It even stands up to when I m on Accutane! A great moisturizer
3925,Marina Santos,1,02-Mar-14,2 people found this helpful,I rate this product 5 stars..... I have struggled with finding a skin moisturizer for over 40 years. My skin is so extremely dry & this product hydrates without a greasy feel. The cream is better due to the thickness but I carry the lotion in my bag for a quick fix. The cream works great after a shower when the skin is slightly moist. Try CeraVe!

3934,Amazon Fan,1,09-Jun-10,2 people found this helpful,This product is amazing. I have been suffering on my hands from Dermatitis for almost 15 years. From time to time it flares up and I was using steroid ointment - but wasn t very effective and when I went off the ointment the dermatitis came right back. With Cerave I put it on twice a day and have discontinued the steroid ointment. I can t believe how quickly it worked. I only stumbled across this product because of other people s reviews  but I am going to make sure my Allergist knows about it.
3935,J. Guo,1,02-Aug-17, ,This is my go to lotion. It s slightly thicker than some other lotions  but that s why it s a cream. It doesn t leave my skin feeling sticky or gross  which is a plus.

3937,Sandy NY,1,31-May-13, ,My son has a touch of eczema and thirsty skin. So I blend CeraVe with a dry skin lotion (per my pediatrician s suggestion and approval) and massage it into his skin. He barely scratches his skin anymore and his skin stays moisturized. I put the blend on him in the morning and evening. I ve been using the same jar of CeraVe for about 2 months and have a little less than 1/2 left.  It s a good product that has lastest a pleasingly long time. I m glad I bought two jars at once.

3966,Josh Baddley,1,20-Feb-14,One person found this helpful,This product is awesome. I used to use the tub of Cetaphil lotion but it can feel greasy and heavy on my skin. This cream is much lighter. And a little cheaper! I plan on trying their face washes as well. Highly recommend this cream for people who want a light-feelings moisturizer with some punch.
3967,Oscar G,1,16-May-19, ,I tried many moisturizer in the past. This one is the best by far. I use it before I leave home and use it again night time. In one week  I started to feel the difference.

3973,XYZ,1,21-Jun-16, ,We tried many different moisturizer for my daughter s eczema  and CeraVe is the only one that worked for us. It absorbs quickly and keeps skin moisturized much longer than other brands we have tried. Also helps that it s unscented so less chance of irritation. This is the go to moisturizer for my daughter now.
3974,Charles W,1,03-Dec-16, ,This is probably the best moisterizing cream you can buy and the price is right for a big jar. Cleared up dry skin for me that I had for years. Bought first jar at my dermatologist office.

3982,P. J. Sisk,1,02-Dec-11,6 people found this helpful,I m very happy with this cream. I use it on my feet at night...especially my heels. All of the cracks on my heels have gone away...amazing since I have tried so many other treatments before with results no where near this good. Not sure if this is totally the result of the cream since I also starting using a pumice stone on my heels at the same time. But I have to give this cream at least some of the credit because I have used pumice stones in the past without this great of a result. Maybe it s a combination of the two. I have been using this jar for almost 6 months now  and there is still about a quarter of a jar left  so it lasts a very long time. I like that it doesn t have a fragrance. I m pretty sure I will order more when this jar is empty.
3983,Katie melancon,1,03-Mar-15,One person found this helpful,Works well  at first i applied to much  and it was very oily. But  you only need a tiny dab on your finger tip and massage it into one area at a time  and repeat if you need more. Works very well for me  i like this cream very much.

3992,Stephanie Starnes,1,02-Nov-18, ,This is a perfect everyday lotion  it’s not scented  greasy  and absorbs nice into the skin.
3993,Mary-Anne M.,1,27-Nov-15, ,Works extremely well. Hands remain soft for 24 hours despite numerous washing. As a nurse  I wash my hands multiple times every hour throughout my 12 hour shift.

4005,Melissa,1,06-Jan-15, ,Excellent lotion for both body and the face but I do recommend the facial moisturizer for the face more then this for the face   but if you have extremely dry skin it helps get deep layers of dry skin off and is still very light on your face  it does not make you break out at all!!!
4006,A. Are,1,09-Jul-18, ,Great cream I wish it wasn’t so expensive
4007,ken,1,15-Jan-19, ,GREAT CREAM

4009,Mandi M.,0,16-Feb-18,3 people found this helpful,First off  this product arrives unsealed. That s safe and hygienic. Second  the moisturizer itself is terrible. It doesn t absorb or sink in  it just sits on the skin. If you wear makeup  you can t use this moisturizer. Because it just sits on your skin  your foundation or concealer doesn t blend into the skin. It just gets pushed around. While it didn t cause any breakouts  the fact that it doesn t actually moisterize the skin makes it unusable. Thanks for the insane amount of worthless moisterizer!
4010,Marie D.,1,20-Oct-17, ,This lotion helped me a lot with my skin. I had this discoloration on my neck and it cleared it up  mostly! It leaves my face refreshed every morning and night!

4028,Stephanie H.,1,17-Dec-13,2 people found this helpful,I have only used this for a few nights  but so far  so good. LOVE the texture - it is creamy but not greasy  your face actually feels soft and smooth after applying it versus shiny and slick like the previous night cream I used to use!!! Being  over 40  sucks anyway but you will notice your skin  changing .... itty bitty tiny fine smiling lines around the mouth... those darn itty bitty crow s feet when you smile (try not to smile  it s not possible)  and oh lord the FOREHEAD itty bitty fine lines! Eek! I was always a bang-less gal but I might have to don bangs again if these lines don t smooth out! Anyhoo this cream is awesome  zero stink  absorbs quickly - I could use it during the daytime but this gal needs SPF 40 at all times  so I use something else (BB cream is groovy  lots of SPF  good for daytime use). I ll continue to use this   a little goes a long way   it s a HUGE container (way the heck better than those little .5 ounce things from  other brands  that cost $40 and last only a few weeks... bleck!)...

This thick  non greasy emollient really does something different. The rash on my wrist immediately became less itchy and the tenderness between my fingers went away. I ve been using it on my heels and elbows too  with almost immediate results  my elbows are definitely smoother and so are my feet. Everything feels better because my fingers tips are smoother and more sensitive. My cuticles are less dry and apt to bleed and even my nails are stronger. Really  it s a miracle cream!

4111,Baddabingbaddaboom,1,02-Mar-15, ,Arrived quickly and well packaged.  This is great moisturizer. I have dry  sensitive  aging skin and this stuff is GREAT for me. My skin is softer and retains more moisture. I have tried a million moisturizers and this is possibly the best.
4112,Shelly,1,25-Feb-16, ,This lotion works really well! I had a lot of trouble with dry skin for several years before I found this lotion. Since then  I ve only had issues with dry skin a couple of times when it s really cold/dry out.

4116,L. Wurschmidt,1,24-Jan-15, ,My dermatologist recommends this brand of moisturizing cream. It is smooth like a thick marshmallow cr?me sauce  and pleasant to use for my thin dry skin. I do not especially like the fragrance  but it does not last long so it is not a deal breaker.
4117,Rebecca,1,25-Jan-18, ,I use this 2x a day! I got my kids and my parents hooked on itas well. It isn t greasy and it doesn t break out our skin.
4118,A. Albers,1,13-Jan-15, ,Very nice cream. Scentless - not with that industrial smell that lingers in the background of some  scentless  products. Super on the skin. It leaves a barrier that you never know is there until you bathe and discover it s still working. Recommended.

It s very thick  definitely more of a cream than a lotion  but it goes on very cleanly  and leaves no oily residue. Despite not feeling oily  my skin still feels soft and smooth to the touch immediately after I put it on.

4190,Lorrie,1,09-Oct-18, ,would buy again
4191,WW,1,08-Aug-14,2 people found this helpful,I routinely recommend this excellent cream to all my eczema patients. It is almost as effective as using a topical ointment   but without the mess and cosmetically unacceptable appearance of ointments. The ceramides in it help to repair the skin barrier and not just try to retain the moisture that is already in the skin. The use of Ceramides in topical creams has been a revolution in skin care. Plus this one costs less than one tenth of the prescription ceramide based topical cream  and still is as effective. This has decreased my use of topical steroids in eczema management by 90%. Unfortunately  one of the jars had partly opened in shipping  but the leakage was mostly contained within the plastic bag that was around each individual jar. But this can happen   so I don t blame anyone for this. Amazon was great about dealing with this one jar issue .
4192,Eris,1,16-Jun-17, ,I love this cream. It was recommended by my dermatologist and it s not greasy or tacky. I think this is the only cream I will use from now on.

This one is wonderful!! Not too heavy! Stays on if you wash your hands. Not greasy! The pump provides a perfect amount. Keep it handy and take a pump a couple of times a day. My mom has been trying to find a hand cream that was similar to one she had years ago. We had tried cheap and expensive ones. FINALLY  this one has her approval. I am thrilled to find this for her.

4204,Tess McGratty,1,24-Jan-18, ,A bit greasier than what I m used to  but very moisturizing.
4205,Mystery,1,13-Aug-17,One person found this helpful,I have been using this daily for 3 years now. In the morning I dip my hand in the container and get enough to rub all over both of my hands. Then I have a towel hanging up specifically to get all the excessive cream off of my hands and it doesn t go to waste as it rubs in next time I use the towel. Then I do the same at night. Also at night before bed I rub this all over my lips. If I do not moisturize my lips  I wake up with cracked skin on my lips and it hurts really bad and it s so weird and regular burts bees chapstick doesn t seem to help at night. I also use this on my feet. I have the lotion version of this too which is a thinner version and I use that sometimes on my face. I prefer the cream version of this for hands and feet because I find those areas to be more dry than others and the cream is really thick and really goes in deep to moisturize vs the thin lotion version.
4206,liz adams,1,19-Sep-16, ,This product is amazing! I was skeptical at first because the lotion broke my face out. I ve been using this the last trimester of my pregnancy and so far my stomach does not have stretch marks. Added bonus!
4207,MW,1,26-Feb-14,One person found this helpful,It s not greasy  light  moisturizing like no other cream I tried and - the most important - does help with my exzema. I use it every day for a year  no clogged pores  no other problems I would have with other creams. I use it on my baby too!
4208,Samantha E,1,21-Jul-14,2 people found this helpful,This is a dream. It feels like it s going to leave a greasy mess on your face  but after a few minutes  my face feels like a million bucks! I also bought the pump to keep bacteria out of the jar.

4214,Lisa Van Dyk,1,24-Oct-17, ,The BEST! Recommended by my dermatologist  I love it!
4215,J. C. H.,1,16-Sep-13,3 people found this helpful,This product was a highly recommended moisturizer so I thought I d give it a shot. I have oily skin and it is not suitable for use in the daytime (boy  that was a bad day) because it gets really slick on the face after awhile. It goes on heavy and sits on the skin a bit  so I just use it at night or even during the day when I know I m not leaving the house. After only about a week of using this and it s foaming face wash counterpart  I feel like my skin is completely different. You can tell that it adds so much to the skin that lasts  the skin on my face almost felt thin before and now it s extremely full and super soft. It makes an amazing night cream because it helps the skin repair itself at a time when your skin repairs itself the most. Again  I don t have any skin condition but it is a really amazing moisturizer.
4216,Amazon Customer,1,28-Jul-18, ,Good product recommended by my dermatologist.
4217,Pamela Jacksonville florida,1,16-Jun-17, ,love all their products you will not find anything on the market that works like this and is sooo inexpensive
4218,Laura Cole,1,28-Jul-15, ,It is a good product if you need a heavier cream that coats the skin lightly. Downside  it peels and flakes off and can look like you re shedding! Not sure if I d buy it again  it s a large jar so still experimenting with when and how to apply.
4219,Diana,1,04-Mar-17, ,Love this cream. Dermatologist recommended it. Best price I have found right to my door with S & S.

I put some on my elbows  hands and feet every night  and POOF! Dry skin is GONE! It isn t greasy and is absorbed by your body very quickly. If you have mildly dry skin  try the LOTION instead. Both are the best dry skin moisturzers I ve ever used and highly recommend them to anyone and everyone! It s a LITTLE pricey  but you don t use much and it will last you a LONG time.

4274,justin,0,19-Mar-19, ,My skin can’t breathe well with this product. Too creamy for some part of skin.
4275,Nessaleah,1,30-Jun-13, ,This is a really nice cream...it feels like a coating to protect the skin. My skin gets very dry from the summer heat and this is really helping. The only complaint I have is not with the product but the shipping. It arrived opened and leaked all over the package!
4276,Beth,1,06-Jan-15, ,This is great moisturizing cream. It was recommended by a dermatologist for my daughter s dry skin and I would up buying for myself as well. You can still feel the moisturizer the next day when you are in the shower.
4277,Sue,1,14-Nov-17, ,This really helps my aging skin!
4278,Amazon Customer,1,08-May-18, ,Perfect for night time
4279,S. SACCO,1,05-Jun-19, ,Works great and not greasy. Will buy again!
4280,M. Speaker,1,14-Feb-15, ,This cream is truly moisturizing. Never had a better one. I take two showers a day  but after two days only I realized there is no need to use the cream after each shower. Only once in the morning and that s good enough. One little problem: it comes in a container and using it can be messy. Easy fix: I bought a large soap dispenser pump and poured the cream in it. Very easy to use now!
4281,Emilio Carrillo Jr.,1,28-Feb-18, ,Great product
4282,miriam,1,22-Mar-15, ,What can I say? It s Cerave. That means that it feels (and does) soak into your skin  and you feel immediate relief from the effects of dry skin. It will be a regular item on my shopping list.
4283,D. Ebben,1,01-Mar-18, ,Great stuff
4284,Avid Amazoner,1,27-Apr-17,4 people found this helpful,After struggling with a skin issue for at least 18 months  including prescription creams and everything else  somehow this cream came to my attention. I got instant relief. My problem was 80% better after one use  no kidding. I ve used it ever since  and my skin issue is resolved ! If you are suffering and think you ve tried everything  try this. You will be glad.
4285,Sdrocks,1,11-Jun-17, ,Perfect for someone with celiacs and other sensitivities.
4286,Julie P. Weeks,1,04-Feb-14, ,It has been terribly dry in California and combined with aging skin - I think CeraVe is a wonderful  affordable solution. It is amazingly inexpensive  thick and smooth - and doesn t come with a cloying perfume. Very impressed by the quality!!
4287,Goldwing47,1,18-Apr-17, ,Been using CeraVe for years  great for dry skin. Great product - Great Price.
4288,Pam Greenwell,1,04-Apr-17,One person found this helpful,Why haven t I used this before? Where is the advertising for good stuff like this? Only found it after researching medical solutions for very dry skin. It wasn t sold by any local stores  so ordered it online. Day one  used it and it felt wonderful! I will say that it REALLY stays on your skin to the point it s like a barrier cream. Even in the shower  the water just rolls off any area where the lotion was applied. Soap breaks it down  but it s strong stuff! If you used this before swimming  you d pretty much be waterproof :-) Bottom line is  I use this every other day now and my skin has improved dramatically. If you don t like the  feel  of lotion on your skin  this is not for you. A little goes a long way. (I think I remember they make a sister product that isn t quite as dense a cream as this  google it)
4289,Sabrina Cheng,1,14-Feb-13,4 people found this helpful,My friend works in a derm office. she gave me a sample and i used it at night. I have dry hands during the winter. My skin turned from dry to soft. Took 2 days. i would highly recommend it for anyone

4292,rubeezy,1,23-Mar-15, ,This cream is amazing! I tried so many..My son has eczema and renew from melaleuca was the only thing that helped it. It got too expensive with shipping costs  and I decided to give this a try and I m happy I did! It s helped him so much! Thank you!

4308,Susan O.,1,04-Feb-18, ,This is the best skin moisturizer ever. I use morning noon and night. Can’t be without it.
4309,mocean,1,11-Nov-16,One person found this helpful,I ve had eczema since I was a child. My Dermatologist won t let me use steroid ointment anymore. I ve used Eletone cream (prescription only) and that works miracles on eczema but  like my Epi-pen  they ve increased the price around 600% over the last8 years or so. This CeraVe cream had great reviews  so thought I d give it a try. It s awesome! I keep my hands covered with cotton gloves and nitrile surgical gloves so that I don t have to wash them throughout the day  so much of my eczema is gone. I covered my hands with this cream and it was wonderful. It s a full bodied  rich cream that has no scent and is absorbed fairly quickly. It s doing wonders for my hands. I finally found my Eletone cream replacement.  Do yourself a favor. If you struggle with eczema  you have to try this cream. I m thrilled I found it and gave it a shot.
4310,Latvian Chick,1,19-May-16,One person found this helpful,Love this cream. Absorbs well leaves my skin well hydrated!

4314,JB,1,24-May-17, ,This is a wonderful cream  I use it on my face and legs!
4315,Mary Ellen Kenemer,1,05-Feb-17, ,So far I have been using this for about a week on myself and my husband - so face and full body use. I ll try to remember to update after a while  but based on short term use I ve been very pleased. Sinks in well and doesn t leave any of the sticky feeling that apparently I am mentally immune to as a girl who has been using moisturizers forever but drives my husband insane. He hates feeling sticky and will grudgingly admit that this sinks in really well and doesn t bother him when he gets into bed after I ve slathered him up as part of our getting ready for bed routine. I ve been using on my face for a week or so now and it seems a bit less greasy than the Aveno I used to use  which I considered pretty low on the greasy scale already. It ll take some time to see if the ongoing results are good  but so far I ve been very pleased. Added this to our Prime subscription service knowing I can take it off if I don t want to continue it  but I m hoping that knowing more of it will keep rolling in will encourage us both to keep using it liberally some stay more comfortable this winter. Price at my time of purchase (can change) was less than most places around me and a tiny bit more than Walmart  but hey - didn t have to go to Walmart  so there s that.
4316,G Mommy,1,09-Aug-13,One person found this helpful,My daughter suffers from severe eczema and Cerave really helps to keep her skin moisturized without the greasy feeling that other lotions/creams/balms can have. It has worked really really well for her skin. I would highly recommend this.

4322,Ryan,1,20-Dec-12,2 people found this helpful,This is by far our favorite moisturizer. We were previously using those gel-based ones and I couldn t stand how hard it was to wash my hands afterwards. We use it for our baby after a bath  and it keeps her skin feeling clean and smooth  as opposed to oily and slimy. Highly recommended.
4323,L. English,1,16-Jul-14,One person found this helpful,Wonderful for feet too. Yep  that s right  not only is this product a wonderful and quick absorbing body moisturizer  but it has completely softened our feet. Great value as well.
4324,Aaron D,1,11-Jun-15, ,I spend a lot of time in the sun  and my skin tends to get dry. This is the best moisturizer I ve ever used  as it seems to be good for the skin without leaving an oily feeling.
4325,Allene Dowling,1,05-Nov-17, ,Love this lotion. Re8commended by dermatologist
4326,Amazon Customer,1,24-Jul-17, ,My dermatologist recommended this moisturizer cream for me while I was on accutane  and I no other lotion has compared to this for me; it leaves your skin feeling clean and not greasy when applied  and it lasts for hours. Your skin will thank you for using this! :)

4332,Jorge Vismara,1,29-Jul-15, ,My wife loves it... with that said  I also was able to soften some of my hands hardening parts around the top of the fingers. But mainly  wife loves it... So I m happy.
4333,Kindle Customer,1,02-Oct-14, ,This is another product recommended by a dermatologist to be used in combination with AmLactin.  Ceramides are the active ingredient  and it is a great product. I will definitely purchase it again.
4334,mozrox,1,11-Feb-14, ,This was recommended by our dermatologist as an alternative to topical medication for our child s eczema. Legs got better  arms are okay. We put it on once a day. Perhaps if we did it 2 times a day her arms would get better faster? Unsure  but her legs got better and we like that it s top rated.
4335,LinwoodMommy,1,02-Jul-15, ,This is a great moisturizing cream. It makes your skin so soft and gets rid of flakes but doesn t leave your hands feeling greasy. It absorbs nicely and lasts a long time.
4336,Amazon Customer,1,19-May-17, ,Great Cream Softens hands in a few days.. Great at night .. just small amount is needed.

4338,Tina M.,1,29-Aug-13,One person found this helpful,I find CeraVe Cream to be very hydrating and gentle  I love to slather it on my face. My only problem is that since I started a retinoid regimen this stuff burns my sensitive skin  and I can t figure out why. Hopefully once my skin adjusts I can continue using this.
4339,Garea51,1,21-Jan-18, ,four stars
4340,LyLy,1,16-Sep-13,One person found this helpful,I think I should have gone with the lotion. This cream is really thick and richer than I need. Plus I don t really like sticking my hand into the tub. I guess I prefer a squeeze bottle or pump in the future. I ve been using this on myself and my small children and it s worked great though.
4341,Roxanne Johnson,1,21-Dec-17, ,Thank you.
4342,Mallie,1,01-Aug-13,2 people found this helpful,It s light but very moisturizing  and it works well for my son  who suffered from really severe (hospitalization-level) eczema when he was 6 months old. We swear by Eucerin cream (the thick stuff in the tub) for the dry winter  but CeraVe is our go-to for summer. Love it.
4343,Judi,1,05-Aug-15, ,I have extremely dry skin and have used numerous lotions and creams. CeraVe didnt absorb immediately but was not sticky like many others. I Highly recommend.
4344,R. Grizzle,1,06-Aug-15, ,I use this cream for my 5 year old  he has eczema and it is a great product to smooth and moisturize is skin. Just think what it can do for regular skin. Love it!
4345,H. Seidel,1,06-Dec-10,3 people found this helpful,My daughter had eczema really bad as a baby and fortunately has since grown out of it  but while she was being treated by a pediatric dermatologist they recommended we use this moisturizer on her. All I can say is it is AMAZING! When we went back to her regular pediatrician she couldn t believe what beautiful skin my daughter had! I use it on both my daughters now  I put it all over their skin after baths and their skin is flawless! I use it on myself too!

4353,Pol,1,29-Mar-13, ,I have use this cream for dry skin all winter on my feet  arms and legs. It has really helped me. I use one to two times a day. The one thing  be careful with putting on bottom of feet because on slick surface (like tubs) you may slide even 12 hours later.
4354,Vino chick,1,07-Dec-16, ,Great for everyday use  but can feel a little heavy in the hot summer months.
4355,April,1,27-Jan-18, ,Skin improved immediately.
4356,Joy,1,30-Jan-14, ,I bought this to use as part as my nightly facial routine. Washed my face with CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser  used a liquid exfoliant   and then applied this CeraVe Moisturizing Cream. It made my skin look really healthy but I broke out a little bit in some areas. I ve since cut down to just washing my face at night  rinsing with water in the morning  and then putting this moisturizer on before applying my powder foundation.  This cream really helps with itchy  dry skin on my face. I usually just apply it around my problem areas and avoid putting it on my acne itself. I makes my skin feel better and makes my makeup look nicer. Applying this before my powder foundation leaves my skin looking smooth and healthy.  The 16oz. tub is $15 and will probably last me for months. I only need to dab a little bit on my face and I m set. Good product for anyone who needs a facial moisturizer.
4357,Wilma,1,09-Dec-14, ,This is the best lotion for problem skin  especially winter rashes. It was recommended by my dermatologist  this was less expensive than getting it from their office  came sealed  no worries.

4361,Travellynn,1,15-Dec-14, ,This brand was recommended to me by dermatologist in the AM face version with SPF30 so I thought I d try the moisturizing cream. So far I like it. The AM version is something I apply daily and while traveling this summer I didn t get a sunburn!
4362,Amazon Customer,1,19-Sep-17, ,I am a straight man. I do not use any cosmetics. I bicycle 80 miles per week and wind dries my face. This is an excellent product. I have used it for years. It is important to realize that this is not a thin liquid or lotion that has a lower price. It is more like a thicker cream and therefore it has less water or liquid in it and is a higher quality product at a higher price. Because it is thick  one uses LESS product and it goes farther for protecting the skin. I am a man and I like that when I put a tiny amount of it on my face it leaves a protective barrier to preserve moisture on my face without looking strange or not masculine. I don t really see it on my face too much except for a smoother and more healthy look. Smells o.k.  not perfumed or female or masculine and has only just a very slight mild chemical odor the goes away after about 5 minutes and is o. k. for men or for women. This is a large jar with a volume about the same amount and equal to a can of soup. When used daily  only on the face and hands  this container should last an average consumer for a couple of months. This is not a cosmetic or a medicine-just a moisturizer to protect against drying.
4363,Mickey,1,27-Nov-16, ,I m a repeat buyer of CeraVe and use it on my entire body  it is very moisturizing...
4364,Wanda Anderson,1,11-Oct-17, ,wonderful to use

4379,nooSphere,1,19-Dec-16, ,Excellent product  helped control my acne when I moved to the Sonoran desert.
4380,Claire,0,21-Apr-16,3 people found this helpful,This is a moisturizer that lots of people rave about  but sadly I just don t like. It moisturizes very well  but it has a way of  sitting  on top of my skin. It feels really uncomfortable (and this is coming from a girl who seals in my moisturizer with vaseline every night!) and it I apply another product on top of it it kind of balls up and rubs off. That can be managed and worked around  but unfortunately it breaks me out as well. If you re looking for a moisturizer specifically with ceramides  I d recommend Dr Jart s Ceramidin cream  or Holika Holika s Super Cera cream for a cheaper option.
4381,Hannah,1,02-Jan-14,4 people found this helpful,Since getting pregnant  I ve had major problems with the skin on my hands. I always had soft (and to be honest clammy) hands  but pregnancy changed all that. The pads of my fingers dried up and cracked painfully  and I developed some sort of dermatitis on much of the rest of my hands. My hands were so dry and uncomfortable that I found myself stopping mid-task to apply lotion dozens of times per day. Lots of my family members have eczema and recommended this stuff to me. Being a cheapskate  I held out  until I finally received it as a gift.  It cured all my skin problems in under 24 hours. Amazing. Worth the money!

4423,trob13,1,20-Feb-15,5 people found this helpful,My dermatologist recommended this product to me several years ago  and I have used it every single day since. I have very bad eczema that affects most of my body  so I need a daily moisturizer along with my topical corticosteroids. If you suffer from eczema you probably know that typical lotions are not helpful. I have also tried other heavy duty products often recommended for eczema such as Eucerin and Aquaphor. I would most definitely recommend CeraVe over these products because it does the job of moisturizing but it is not at all greasy like the others. The benefit of CeraVe is that it is a cream while the others are ointments. I think the efficacy and nongreasy application is worth the higher cost.

4463,Sheena,1,06-Jun-17, ,Great moisturizer
4464,B. Ludwig,1,06-May-14,One person found this helpful,This is my last piece of my beginner skincare regiment. Per recommendation by Reddit s r/skincareaddiction  I purchased this along with St. Ives exfoliating pads and the Cerave hydrating cleanser. It s been just two weeks  but my skin feels AMAZEBALLS.  One needs very little of this cream to make my face feel completely moisturized. For the first week of owning this cream  I kept taking out too much with my finger  so I ended up slathering it all over my face  neck  AND hands to use it up. The Matrix Biolage 16 Oz Jar Pump fits it perfectly  so I used that to prevent contamination. I now start out an application with half a pump  and add more if I feel my skin needs it.  On the third day of using this  my skin had two breakouts. They were not cystic or painful  however. In fact they were very small  like two tiny (and very dry) white granules popping out my skin  which were easily removed. I am assuming these were just the remains of a  purging  of my previous facial products. After that  my skin has been perfectly clear.  Granted  it s been just two weeks since I ve started using this  so my raving may be premature. If there is any negative change in my skin later  I will come back and edit this review. As for now  though  this product has proved to be a great value for the price.
4465,David E. Hoy,1,15-Sep-14,One person found this helpful,CreaTive moisturizing cream was recommended to me by my dermatologist because of dry  scaling skin.

4492,Sheryl Spencer,1,25-Jul-17,One person found this helpful,Nearly every woman has her special moisturizer  go to  product: my mom swears by Elizabeth Arden s Visible Difference. I have a friend who has faithfully used Nivea for 20+ years. My grandmother loved her some Vitamin E oil. And I used to pride myself on a combination of petroleum jelly and Dr. Hauschka s Rose Day Cream too((although I d still consider using it if it weren t so damned expensive and came in a nice tub like this versus its tiny  pricy tube)).  But after I saw a reality show  star  whose skin I admire praising this stuff on her YouTube channel  I figured it was worth a good try  especially at such a great price and large quantity. I was also sold on the good overall reviews and the fact that it s supposedly developed by dermatologists.  A few months into using this stuff and I m officially hooked: it s absolutely wonderful so far and I plan on sticking with this for a nice  long while! It s nothing earth-shattering or anything  but I ve noticed very subtle changes in my skin. The fine lines developing on this 40-year-old face seem a bit less evident((to ME  anyways!)) and my skin just seems more subtle and tight. Even my middle  11  that was bugging me isn t bugging me nearly as much and I m not as hot to go get some annual botox on that area((yet?)). Now granted  every now and then I ll get a couple of tiny bumps on my skin in response to this stuff  but it s nothing evident or alarming---I m just assuming it s a natural reaction to some of those moisturizing agents in there. And did I mention there s no scent on this? I m loving that aspect!  I like to offset this with a twice weekly break courtesy of Egyptian Magic((which is also quite lovely)) and I still use my beloved Albolene to remove make-up  but other than my daily dose of Garnier BB cream  this is all that regularly glazes my precious skin. I just wish I d discovered it earlier and am more than thrilled to share my happiness with this product so far! Fabulous price and excellent response: who could ask for anything more?!
4493,Rachel Baror,1,10-Aug-15, ,The best lotion for anyone (Adults & children). I spent tons of money on high end lotions as well as the basic baby lotions and this is still #1.
4494,BB,1,12-Jan-16,2 people found this helpful,About me: mid-twenties  moderately dry and flaking skin  acne-prone.  I purchased this hoping it would give my dry face a much needed glowing boost. Unfortunately  I do not feel this provides enough hydration for my face (which still feels dry to the touch and itchy after application)  but I do feel it works very well as a body moisturizer. It leaves my body feeling smooth to the touch and I love that it dries quickly so I am not left feeling greasy  especially in the summer months.  Additionally  I like that this is a scent-free formula so I am able to mix it with my perfumes to make my own scented lotions. I do not feel like this is a miracle product  as some of the other reviewers claim  but it is perfectly fine body lotion. For my face  I definitely prefer Cetaphil or Argan oil because it is a bit more hydrating leaves my skin a bit greasy  which I like when paired with foundation. I will repurchase if it continues to be such a large quantity for the price.  Pros: -Moisturizes body well -Non-greasy -Unscented -Good value  Cons: -Is not rich enough to moisturize my moderately dry face

My nose cracked and peeled layer after layer and I had blood vessels bursting in my cheeks from dry skin. If I put on any makeup it would cake up and look dry and patchy; I was so embarrassed. I tried everything from super expensive moisturizing cream to Olay night repair masks (which made my skin flare up and much worse) and every oil you could think of including coconut  rose hip  grape seed and still no relief. I read the reviews on this stuff and had to try it. The first time I used it I think my face was too far gone because it was only temporary relief but after a while my skin improved. It saved my skin the rest of winter dramatically but I had some very tough dry patches around my mouth that were stubborn. I would recommend this before any expensive creams or oils!

She said either aquaphor or something with ceramides in it.... well HELLO CERAVE! ! ! ! Thank you for the awesome product. Every spot of eczema that my boys had has CLEARED up.

4593,Marc,1,08-Dec-10,7 people found this helpful,I ve been using Curel lotions  especially the Ultra Healing flavor  for a long time  and I have recommended them to fellow eczema sufferers as it has been the only lotion that has kept my skin moisturized well and without irritation at all. Keri lotion was very thick  didn t have a good scent  and irritated my skin. Aveeno and Lubriderm always felt very thin for lotions and didn t moisturize very well  in my opinion.  I had a recent flare up of my eczema not too long ago  and my dermatologist strongly recommended using Cerave on areas that have calmed down considerably as a maintainance product. After being turned off by two brands of moisturizing creams  I have to say this is the best out of the three I have tried! In fact  I ve been using this to moisturize my body after a shower over my Curel lotion  and it has worked wonders!  The other two I ve used were Eucerin and Vanicream. - Eucerin was VERY thick. Thick to the point where it was hard to get out of the tub and apply on my skin without aggravating it. - Vanicream was fairly runny  I would say  and it had an odd scent  didn t absorb well  and didn t moisturize very well  I think. - Cerave s consistency was just right to me. At first look  I thought it would be very runny  but after dipping my fingers in  the cream was very consistent and didn t run. Very easy to apply.  The only thing I ve noticed  for me  is that I need to apply it twice a day. But I have a pretty severe chronic case of atopic dermatitis  so that would make sense. It s moisturizing enough initially to suite most people s problem areas  I would think.
4594,Matthew,1,15-Jun-16, ,CeraVe is fantastic. I am in my late 20s and use this every other night before bed. Helps to make my skin feel very smooth.
4595,Vonnie,1,21-Jan-16, ,I do not like the smell  but it is a great cream to use especially in winter.
4596,chunnie,1,27-Feb-16, ,Use it everyday and keeps my face and body feel moisturized.

4598,Rita,1,27-Apr-15, ,I like it  but don t like the slight wax feeling after application on the face. I would use on the body.
4599,Ellen,1,04-Dec-14, ,I have this product for my 4-year-old  also for adults  the result has been great! It s very light  easy to apply and works wonderfully on dry skin.

4603,workingstiff,1,26-Sep-16, ,This stuff just works. I have never had a problem with dry skin. About a year ago my legs were getting blotchy and actually waking me up at night. When I was a kid I had allergies that were bad but I outgrew them. My third son unfortunately inherited the skin allergies as did his son. My doctor said use some cream and gave me their standard list. this one was way at the bottom. I tried the others. Changed soap to Dove  not very manly but desperate times desperate measure. I followed the instructions   towel dry off out of the shower and immediately  slather  on the ointment. I did it for a couple of months with little success. The skin on my legs was smooth but still itched. I finally got the Cerave cream and within a week the itching stopped. I use it every day after showering. My son  who just finished pharmacy school  had independently found it and was using it on himself and his 4yo. It was helping them both. So I am sold and have been using it successfully for about a year.
4604,Jim White,1,09-Dec-16, ,Very nice feel and works well

4606,TwoLeftFeet,1,08-Apr-15,2 people found this helpful,This product was recommended by my dermatologist for dry skin. I was already using the CeraVe facial products  so I trusted the brand. Gave it a try  and I absolutely love it! No more dry  itchy  flaky  winter skin on my legs. It is a bit thick  so I put it on right out of the shower while I m still wet  and that makes it easier to spread. It absorbs quickly  and makes my skin feel fantastic. I purchased the  Surgeon s Skin Secret Pump  top to go with it  and so glad I did - so much easier than trying to deal with the lid each time.
4607,Karen,1,03-Jan-15, ,My husband has used it for several years. It works exceptionally well in keeping his dry skin moisturized. Convenience of ordering is great.

I also use CeraVe effectively on my hands  which are in and out of the water throughout the day to wash the dishes or to clean the house. CeraVe makes my hands feel much younger  soft and well moisturized without the greasy feeling. Most of all  I LOVE CeraVe for my feet  especially the heals. CeraVe eliminated the skin cracks left behind by past water retention issues during pregnancy and it makes my feet feel  young  again.

It definitely helped! Very good moisturizer for the skin  helped keep the itch and dryness down. The texture is very nice  light and creamy  absorbs into the skin without being greasy. He had it at work and one of the female coworkers has a problem with dry skin  she asked to use some on her overly dry hands.........She loved it! And wanted to know where she could purchase it. So far  Amazon has had the best price on the 16 oz. Yes  I would recommend this to anyone that s looking for a lightweight  non greasy  moisturizing lotion.

4701,K ai Roberts,1,01-Sep-17,6 people found this helpful,I have sensitive skin that reacts to almost any scent  and gets super dry very easily. For years I used Mary Kay Enriched Moisturizer Formula 1: Nothing else would do. Then MK discontinued the product in the midst of the (now disproven) paraben scare. Fast forward 8 years of searching ...I had been using Cerave moisturizing cleanser for a year  and on a whim decided to search for their moisturizers...I found this gentle  unscented product complete with my beloved parabens. It s a little thicker than my old standby  so I have to wait 10 minutes to let it absorb before applying foundation. BUT  this moisturizer has improved my skin so much I hardly even wear foundation any more. At night I often apply a second layer  and for plane travel  I slather it on with abandon. Stats: over 40  very pale Irish skin  live in the NW and travel all over US  so subjected to multiple climates. Side note: Cerave s facial sunscreen also rocks.

4755,TG,1,27-Jul-15,One person found this helpful,This stuff works great for my eczema. I m using it morning and night (and in between if I get itchy) and it s been doing an amazing job of preventing flare-ups. When my skin starts turning bumpy and red  I ve found that if I can catch it quick enough with the Cerave it ll calm back down without needing my prescription cream. I d say I only need to use my cortisone cream 25% of the amount I was using it before.  Note that this review is for the cream. The lotion (thinner stuff in the pump bottle) has not been as effective for me.

I have chronically dry skin  and my nose always flakes  however  I m usually not very fond of buying moisturizers as they clog my pores and give me acne  which is definitely not preferable. Cerave ream moisturizes my skin without giving me breakouts. I would recommend it to anyone.
4767,1kidmomma,1,27-Dec-10,4 people found this helpful,My youngest was diagnosed with moderate to severe eczema at around 4 months of age. Her eczema is much improved now  but Cerave was and is part of her moisturizing regimen as prescribed by her pediatric dermatologist. We have tried Cetaphil  Baby Aquaphor  Baby Aveeno  Gentle Naturals among other creams and ointments  but Cerave hands-down is the best cream to treat her skin on a regular basis and even to deal with flare-ups. I recommend this cream to anyone who wants to see real improvement in a baby suffering from eczema.

4822,J.,1,06-Sep-14,One person found this helpful,It s not bad  and it does moisturize very dry skin  but it doesn t get absorbed well into the skin. It will easily come off with perspiration and rubs off easily. This being said  it is still a good product and I still use it so I can t really say too many bad things about it. It doesn t have a greasy feel.. more like a synthetic sort of rubbery feel upon application? Not sure how to describe it other than it s not off-putting or gross feeling to apply. I probably wouldn t purchase again  but it does work.
4823,J.E. Ramont,1,23-Mar-14, ,This cream is excellent at moisturizing my super dry skin. Just a small amount goes a long way and it keeps my skin moisturized all day.
4824,SKW,1,01-Jan-14,4 people found this helpful,I have extremely dry skin and this product is the answer to my prayers! It hold in moisture and keeps my skin soft all day. It protects skin very well. When I shower the day after use  I still can feel the CeraVe on my skin. No other product does that and I ve tried an embarrassing amount of moisturizers. It even helps my eczema. The $900 creams don t help my eczema.

4843,Ak bak chak,1,28-Dec-12, ,I chose this product even though there is another CeraVe listed at Amazon with the same content/quantity(16oz) but cheaper(USD 12.97 vs 20).The only difference I could find was the weisght this was 1.5 pounds the other was 1 pound.The other one had not so good reviews and was listed as  origin:China . The cream itself feels good wont leave that oily feeling.The tub lacks any type of protective barrier when opened making you wonder whether it is used and re-filled(?).

The dr didn t want to use steroids near her eyes so suggested putting vaseline on the scaly spots. It didn t seem to do much so my SIL suggested trying CeraVe. It s made an amazing difference. After using this for a few weeks the scaly spots have cleared up on my daughter s face. She still has some discoloration but the spots are no longer raised or as itchy. Highly recommended.

4859,S. McCoy,1,20-Aug-12,2 people found this helpful,My son has had issues with eczema since he was born and now is a year old. When it flares up  he literally has it on nearly every inch of his body. We have tried so many different lotions (Aveeno Eczema  Aquaphor  and Eucerin to name a few) and nothing has ever completely alleviated the problem. I try to avoid using steroid creams for any length of time. The director at my son s daycare recommended Cerave and said how well it worked on her daughter s eczema. I was pretty skeptical  but decided to give it a shot after a bad flare up my son had from a reaction to sunblock. After about five days of applying it once daily  my son s eczema has disappeared. His skin has never looked so healthy. I know different treatments work for different people  but this one is definitely a winner for us.

4872,Anerley4U,1,05-Jun-13,9 people found this helpful,I m not sure what happened to my face for the past 2 weeks. I ve never had major acne problems or bad skin...pimple every now and then. I remember putting Alpha Hydrox Spot Light Targeted Skin Lightener (pretty much a dark spot remover) on my cheek area and outer part of my nose. Went out in the sun for about 30mins (that s the most sun exposure I ve had because I do not like heat at all) a couple of days later...next thing I knew  I woke up and had like these burnt marks on my cheeks and nose. At first I thought my face was just dry so I did my routine with my Mary Kay 3-in-1 Cleanser but then when I put on my makeup (after using my Neutrogena oil free moisturizer)  mainly my foundation (cream  liquid  and/or powder) I noticed that the make-up was just sitting there and it formed like a rim around the dark spots - it was SO obvious! I noticed that I could peel some of it away when I scratched it lightly or used a tweezer  so I told myself - lay off the makeup and just put something to soften it so it can peel away faster. I used Vaseline  Shea butter  and even Neosporin at night but the flakes were still there after washing my face with the cleanser. Some of it went away but I noticed it was still there when I put on makeup and it was kind of hard like a scar. So I tried using a scrub at night  which it did help very little  but I would have to scrub my face kind of hard with Aveeno Positively Radiant Skin Brightening Daily Scrub in order to remove the flakes  then my cheeks were kind of red and sore. I knew that things were not getting better because it would burn after using the Aveeno scrub and when putting on the Shea butter or Neosporin.  So finally looked online and did some research on Tuesday  June 4th on how to get rid of  dead/flaky skin  (mind you  the past 2 weeks  I barely wore makeup). Found this one article online and they said the key was: 1) CLEANSE (with a scrub or exfoliate) 2) FACIAL STEAM (pour hot water in a bowl and cover your head with a bath towel and allow the steam to penetrate - be careful not to burn yourself! If you feel the steam is too much remove the towel for a short period of time and go back) 3) HYDRATE (with a moisturizer with that contains ceramides  niacinamide  and hyaluronic acid to draw in moisture  strengthening and plumping skin  plus SPF 30 to protect it from the sun)  When researching the moisturizer  quite a bit of websites said CeraVe was one of the best and highly recommended by dermatologist. After reading the reviews  I said to myself -  Why the hell not !. I went to Wal-Mart and purchased the CeraVe on Tuesday  June 4th. I followed the 3 steps above and put the CeraVe all over my face  heavier application on my cheeks and side of my nose where the burn marks were and went to bed. Woke up this morning  Wed  June 5th and without even washing my face  I noticed immediately that the flakes had reduced and they were falling off! Washed my face with the Aveeno Scrub and more came off. My cheeks and nose was not hurting  it was calm  felt soft and nourished! I AM SO IMPRESSED with CERAVE. I can t believe it worked so fast and effectively. My husband looked at my face and said  It looks much better  (and this is a man of few words)!!  I know my comment/story was long but had to be thorough from beginning to end for you to get a better understanding of my experience and why I rated the product the way I did. Like I mentioned  not sure what I had  dry skin eczema  sun burn or if it was due to the skin lightener I used. In summary  I m going to continue this process until my face returns to its normal state. I think CeraVe will be my new daytime moisturizer - it doesn t clog your pores  makes your skin feel soft and smooth  and in my opinion its great healing source for burns  dryness  flaky skin  etc.  For only $12 (at Wal-Mart)  it beats a trip to a dermatologist and paying a co-pay of $25-50  right? So TRY IT  seriously doubt that you ll be disappointed.  A. Little (34 yr. old  Ghanaian Women) Shepherdstown  WV

4876,Robin,1,28-Dec-17, ,Hands down the beast moisturizing cream I have used in a long time. I live in a dry climate and it is winter time making it extra dry. I put this on and the next day I notice a difference. In the past I have used lotions  expensive ones and feel like they don t make a difference. I am not a fan of creams that sit on top of the skin and get absorbed into my clothing. This gets absorbed quickly and doesn t leave a residue on my clothing. It is non comedogenic which means it won t clog pores. If you are concerned with body acne this would be a great cream to use.
4877,Anon,1,07-Mar-17, ,My dermatologist recommended this and I love it. It is not greasy as I expected. Very pleased and will purchase again.
4878,Tim X,1,09-May-14, ,This item might be overpriced  but it makes my skin feel great without being greasy. Recommended for sure. _ _
4879,Liverpoolsue,1,25-Mar-14, ,I like the way this feels on your skin  seems to soak in really well. I havn t noticed any difference to my wrinkles yet thou. Great moisturizer for the price feels better on my skin than the Oil of Olay I have been using which costs a lot more for a small jar of it.

4885,aljacobs,1,10-Jun-13,One person found this helpful,The first two I ordered arrived in the carton opened  possibly by vibration or never had the tops tightened by the shipper. What a mess. Two pounds of goo. I submitted pics and a claim and Amazon got right on it and had it reshipped next day and all is well. My dermatologist recommended it above all others and it does work. Not messy or greasy. You judge companies by how they handle a problem and Amazon gets five stars in this gooey mess.

4920,Doggo,1,21-Feb-16,3 people found this helpful,Not sticky  does not cause oily skin to become even more oily. Keeps skin moisturised for hours even after skin gets wet. No annoying scent. Also after applying  there is a faint and nice cooling sensation as the cream gets worked into the skin and dries at the surface. 10/10 would recommend. Better than that overpriced Cetaphil or Aveeno or other big company brands like Vaseline...
4921,CPerry,1,19-Jun-15, ,Excellent quality product.
4922,Cynthia Warner,1,14-Apr-14, ,I use several CeraVe products and this is the best. Due to a skin condition  my dermatologist recommended it. It is fragrance free and does not leave a sticky finish. I highly recommend this product.
4923,Howie,1,10-Feb-14, ,CeraVe is awesome. My hands crack and peel  especially the fingertips. CeraVe softens them up so the aren t so rough.

4926,busyworkinmom,1,10-Apr-13, ,Great product. Recommended by a friend of ours who is a retired doc (although not a dermatologist) and has been using it for years My dad has sensitive skin  and it really helped clear up a patch of eczema that had been driving him crazy all winter. He needs it less now that Springtime is here. It worked well on my daughter  who also has bad skin -- I d say don t put it on your face (or your kid s face) though. I am finally convinced that face skin is actually different -- we put it on my daughter after a bath  and it made her cheeks itch and turn red. I thought that was a fluke til I it happened a second time. Oops!
4927,Andrew O.,1,06-Feb-14, ,This lotion lasts all day  and doesn t go on to thick or too greasy. Doesn t smell too medicated  and leaves your skin feeling great. Works great for my eczema.

4934,T. Fleming,1,02-Mar-14, ,I have pretty great skin to begin with--I ve always used oil of olay  but I switched to the CeraVe because of the reviews. It has made a huge difference in my face. I m 47 and had started to get light wrinkling around the eyes. After using the product for a week I can already see a difference. It moisturizes but isn t heavy (though it feels like it might be that way when you first put it on). It works so well I ve started to use it all over my body!
4935,Amazon Customer,1,28-Dec-16, ,I use this as a facial moisturizer and it works perfectly.
4936,Larry H.,1,23-Nov-15, ,Doesn t come with a dispenser as shown.
4937,Russell Stromberg,1,12-Aug-15, ,Great cream reccomended by our dermatologist. I won t waste my money on cheap lotions anymore.
4938,Claire,1,04-Feb-13, ,I got these for my husband and daughter who both suffer from eczema. It s super gentle  easy to spread (not thick like some other creams)  no fragrance  simple ingredients. They go through these big tubs fast. :) I tried it one day and like it too. I even used it on my face and it doesn t break me out. Very moisturizing without feeling greasy  and it really lasts 24hrs! Good for face and body. And best of all  so cheap!!!
4939,Bradley G. Jellerichs,1,29-Mar-09,11 people found this helpful,This is one of the best moisturizers available. Most so-called moisturizers actually work by trapping moisture against the skin (which is why we recommend patients apply them within 3 minutes of a bath/shower). Cerave actually contains a bio-chemical that is naturally produced by the skin (ceramides). That means you re immersing the skin in something it knows it likes  which is in contrast to occlusive  moisturizers  that just trap in moisture. I use this cream on my face and hands  but of course you can put it anywhere you have dry skin. Another class of moisturizers I recommend are those based on lactic acid  such as Carmol  Am-Lactin and Lac-Hydrin. If price is really an issue  consider an older class of moisturizers that includes Cetaphil or its generic equivalent.
4940,GarrettM,1,09-Jan-17, ,Use this product everywhere! Its a brilliant moisturizer and makes your skin feel like new!
4941,Toni Harris,0,21-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,I can t in my right mind put this on my face. Without a tamper proof seal the thought of someone else s dirty hands in there from anywhere in the world disgusts me. I work in healthcare so I know how easily feces spreads around to different objects like doorknobs  keyboards  phones  etc. There s just no way I m using this. if it were a pump bottle I d go for it but this is disgusting. CeraVe you need to rethink your product packaging immediately. This is disgusting. Zero stars if i could.
4942,joe,1,01-Jan-14,One person found this helpful,Works well to keep my skin moist and is not overly greasy. Lasts for a long time and continues to provide moistening.
4943,maverick,1,12-Nov-17, ,Great Product
4944,Barefootd,1,17-Oct-15, ,I have been using this cream for over a month. I discovered after being in a more humid climate for vacation that my skin was much smoother and clearer. I returned to my dryer climate and began using this heavier cream instead of a light weight lotion. What a huge difference. My skin loves this. It also has some healing ingredients  which help with minor irritations. I have oily skin and always thought a lighter lotion was better. Not anymore. I am sold on using a cream instead.
4945,lisa K,1,23-Jul-15, ,super hydrating and not oily which is so important to me   and overall a great moistruizer the only thing is it should come with a pump:(

Recommend this to everyone struggling with dry skin it s just the best and I have a whole box of other stuff I tried to prove it.

4961,Giovanni,1,20-Jan-17,2 people found this helpful,It works pretty well and hydrates my skin but it takes a little while to sink in. I do not like the smell however. It smells like gak or some other sort of slime/putty. I stopped using it all the time because I put it on my shoulders  back and arms and could smell it. It covers up the nice smelling body wash I use. If I m really dry I d use it.

4965,ShaNeil Coons,0,23-Nov-13,2 people found this helpful,This cream works wonders on my baby s dry skin. I ordered here because it was a bigger container than I could find in stores and we use it regularly so the price was right. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED to find that it was not sealed properly and had leaked everywhere! :( Such a waste of cream and my money. I should have just gone to Walmart I suppose.
4966,Evanthia,1,02-Mar-13,One person found this helpful,THANKS CERAVE! I ve had so many problems with dry skin  especially my hands. My work requires that I wash my hands a lot. It was embarrassing how bad they always looked. I ve only used CeraVe for a few days and what a difference! Even on the first day  it was incredible. It s not greasy and disappears into your skin right away. At the end of the day I put it on my hands before going to bed and it adds to the effect - yet because it disappears it doesn t mess up bedding or clothing. Even when used on feet  you don t have to worry about slipping or leaving residue on floors even if you walk barefoot - it s all absorbed by your skin in just minutes. I became interested in this cream when I first learned about ceramides (see the link below or just search Google for reputable sites that describe ceramides). The trouble is  it appears all the ceramide products out there are VERY expensive  and for TINY quantities. But CeraVe  at least from this vendor (CeraVe)  is relatively inexpensive. Also you don t have to use much each time so this big 16 oz jar lasts a long time. Try it  at this price  what do you have to lose? Site regarding ceremides - recommend you read this...... [...]

He is now almost two and we still use it especially in the winter for his dry skin. The is very little smell and the cream goes on smoothly.

4998,Yevgenia,1,10-Jan-12,8 people found this helpful,I have been using this for a couple of years as it was recommended to me by my dermatologist. Yes  the packaging is boring  but this product is great for face and body. I have been suffering with acne and this is the only product that does not irritate the skin. Sometimes I get bored with the fragrance and just add a few drops of essential oil - orange  rose  whatever I like. Great under make-up  great overnight. Great under your medication cream. You will want to supplement this cream with anti-aging serums. Yes  it is a bit expensive  but it is way cheaper than buying a face cream at Sephora. I cannot recommend this product enough.
4999,Amy Starr,1,28-Dec-12, ,My dermatologist recommended this product a few years ago  and I ve been using it on my face/body ever since. Some skin creams dissipate over time  but this one keeps my skin soft and hydrated. There are some more expensive and some less expensive creams available  but this is a definite keeper for me. As the saying goes   Don t mess with success.

5031,Jaclyn,1,29-Oct-12, ,I have incredibly dry  irritated skin. I shave my legs every night and it makes them very irritated and itchy. This lotion calms my skin down instantly and keeps them soft and supple well into the next day. This lotion is extremely thick though  so I reccommend using it before bed  not before squeezing into skinny jeans!
5032,Jia,1,10-Feb-17, ,I like it ~~

5034,Catriona in Colorado,1,20-May-16,19 people found this helpful,I m in my early 60s  and finally decided to take action to improve my aging skin just 2 years ago. Retired and living on a very tight budget  I ve spent SO many hours online  researching the scientifically-proven and *genuinely* effective ingredients to repair and prevent signs of aging. Step 2 is finding the most affordable products that contain these ingredients. Cerave s Moisturizing Cream is a gold medal winner in both categories! My skin looks and feels soft  smooth  and younger than it did in my 50s! I get compliments from my (slightly jealous) friends  who have even asked me if I  had a little work done.  I even received the most coveted compliment of all; at my recent entire-body skin cancer checkup (not my favorite day at the doctor s  that s for sure!)  my dermatologist peered at my face and said   Your skin looks great. I d put you at about 10 years younger than your real age. What are you using?  So I told him: After morning cleansing  I apply a 10% glycolic acid lotion  followed by a Vitamin B serum  then the Cerave Moisturizing Cream  and finally sunscreen. After nighttime cleansing  I use a Retinol serum  followed by a vitamin C and E serum  then the Cerave Moisturizing Cream. He nodded his approval and told me to  keep up the good work.  Honestly  I m a tomboy  so I don t enjoy all the time and effort it takes to apply multiple layers of goo to my face. But I grin and bear it because IT WORKS! I believe Cerave s claims that their products are designed with the help of dermatologists  as I ve done the research myself. I won t bore you here with an explanation of the usefulness of the ingredients  Cerave explains it all on their site if you re interested. And you get a GIGANTIC tub for 10 to 15 dollars here or at your supermarket or drugstore. I keep an eye out for sales at my local stores. My first tub lasted me nearly a year  and that s applying twice daily to my face and neck  and once daily (at night) to my hands. Twelve bucks a year? When you realize how much you could spend on the overpriced and over-hyped skin products offered in this kabillion-dollar beauty market  this is downright amazing! You don t need to smear it on - a little goes a long way. It s not greasy or shiny at all  it seems to entirely absorb into my skin within a minute. Unfortunately  there s no single magic potion out there  you really do need to use several different treatments to improve aging skin. In my opinion  Cerave is the only moisturizer you will ever need to keep your skin in top condition!

5037,Tucsonian,1,03-May-13,One person found this helpful,Our dermatologist recommended this for my husband s dry skin and he is not a lotion kind of person. The cream is superior to the lotion and puts a protective shield on the skin and holds in moisture. He loves it and has me rub it on his back after showering. He also applies to arms and legs.
5038,Jac C.,1,22-Jul-15, ,Love this project. My daughter has really dry skin and this is the very best lotion I have found and used!!!!

5042,E. McDonald,1,12-Dec-12,3 people found this helpful,My dermatologist suggested I try using CeraVe cream -- he said it might eliminate or reduce the need to use a prescription steroid cream for my outbreaks of seborrheic dermatitis. He was right -- I haven t needed to use the prescription AT ALL since I started using CeraVe on my face several months ago. I love the way my skin looks and feels when I use this cream. It is true that the cream is kind of thick  but it is not greasy or shiny. I will probably be using this cream for the rest of my life -- love it! BTW  I initially ordered the package of two 2-oz. tubes (which are great for travel)  and now I have ordered the 16-oz. jar for use when I m at home (since the jar is more economical).

5059,Alex g,1,23-Oct-13,One person found this helpful,I use this in a routine that is african black soap mixed with cerave hydrating cleanser in the evening + moisturizing cream  rinse with water in the morning + moisturizing cream. A week and a half in and my skin looks GREAT in the morning. Unfortunately I introduced a few new elements at once so I can t exactly pinpoint  but if nothing else the cream is not making me oily or causing breakouts so it has earned 5 stars from me.

Seriously  the worst part was the itchiness. Over several months  I tried almost every single moisturizing cream/lotion at the store  but nothing worked. Finally  I went to a dermatologist and recommended this to me and it s worked wonders. No more itchy  dry  scaly skin!
5062,SouthernKahrCarrier,1,12-Feb-10,8 people found this helpful,My daughter often complained of itchy skin  and was diagnosed with mild Eczema. She was given a prescription  and this cream was also recommended. As long as we remember to use this cream her skin stays very healthy and she rarely complains of itchiness. Even 12 hours after applying this cream her skin seams moisturized. Regular lotions does not do that.

5074,Amanda,1,17-Jun-14,One person found this helpful,My husband s dermatologist recommended this product for his extremely dry skin. I started using it a month ago and found it really helpful with my dry and sensitive skin as well. I recommended this product to my daughter and she told me that her dermatologist has recommended the same product and she has been using this for awhile. I love the product. My skin feels so smooth for a long time. I applied the cream all over my body after my bath at night as well as first thing in the morning. Feel so much more protected when I go for a walk outside....
5075,B. Neiski,0,27-Nov-13,6 people found this helpful,After hearing absolutely rave reviews about this cream on Reddit  I figured I d have to give it a try. However  it did not work with my skin. I felt the consistency was much much too thick and left my skin feeling almost sticky. I began breaking out a little bit also  which could be from something else  but it seemed to get better once I stopped using this. Also when I mixed this cream with my sunscreen  it would glob up in little balls. Will NOT buy again! I have been using the remainder of the jar on my very dry hands and it seems to be working alright.

5082,Rabbit,1,03-Nov-11,11 people found this helpful,I love this moisturizer! It does what it claims! I have been using La Mer for over 7 years. My skin is extremely dry and it was the ONLY moisturizer that works for me. After I found out CeraVe  I decided to give it a try. It is a big container. I have to admit my first impression was not good. The texture is more like whipping cream which I don t like  it can easily get out of the container.. Also  when I applied it on my face  it felt weird.. Kinda sticky feeling. But the feeling goes away very quickly. After a while  it felt really light as if I didn t use anything! But my skin feels comfortable and hydrated!! I also apply it on my legs and ankles. I noticed dramatic result since my leg is always chapped.. Now it looks smooth.. The only reason I give it 4 star instead of 5 is because I can t use makeup over it.. It cakes up my foundation so badly... Since I don t wear makeup that often  it doesn t bother me that much!

5097,Tim In Seattle,1,03-Dec-12,One person found this helpful,If you suffer from dry itchy skin  you should give this a try. I ve had seasonal dry skin for years  and the itching used to drive me crazy during the winter (the air can get pretty dry in Chicago during the winter). I ve used other moisturizers--some were just OK  some were just way too greasy for me. This one is as close to perfect as I can imagine.  My dermatologist gave me a sample a couple of months ago  and I liked the way it felt and it seemed to be very effective. I ordered a larger quantity from Amazon  and have been using it since.  It is a terrific product!

5106,RT in Roanoke  VA,1,18-Nov-14,7 people found this helpful,My daughter is a nurse and she recommended this as the best OTC medication for my eczema. It is a thick cream that I can even put on my upper eye lids without getting into my eyes. I also have a big blotch on my shoulder that is healing slowly but nicely (the skin takes time to heal from the inside out). It doesn t smell and is not greasy. I found it to be much better than Aveeno.
5107,NumbersBand15-60-75,1,14-Dec-15, ,CeraVe and Cetaphil are great cream moisturizers for dry  cracked skin. They both absorb well and are not greasy. CeraVe is a lighter formula  particularly good for use during the day. They are both neutral and don t make angry skin angrier.

5115,Lizziemac2,1,27-Apr-13, ,My dermatologist recommended CeraVe for a rash that I have from medication. It was the best. I had tried many others before this  and it is definitely the best. Great value too buying it on line.
5116,Marilyn Piepho,1,22-Dec-12,One person found this helpful,If you suffer from extremely dry skin all over your body you ought to try this cream. Recommended to me by my dermatologist  I can truthfully say that it is the best cream I have found for terribly dry skin. The trick in getting best results is to use it just after bathing  while your skin is still a bit damp. In this way  the cream seals in the moisture already on your skin. Use it all over your body if you are very  very dry.........it is probably the best out on the market.
5117,@karentran_sf,1,24-Jul-13,3 people found this helpful,Very moisturizing without being greasy. If you use it multiple times a day your skin (even hands that get constantly washed and rough heels) become MUCH softer. I ended up using less and less cream the longer I used it because my skin was no longer as dry.
5118,Heather,1,16-Mar-16, ,Recommended by our dermatologist for our daughter. This helps tremendously with her dry skin. Can t find it cheaper anywhere else have seen it as expensive at 22$ very good lotion. Great for everyday use.
5119,TinyFeet,1,09-Jun-13,One person found this helpful,This brand was recommended by my pediatrician. We love it because it serves its purpose and it goes on the skin smoothly without feeling greasy.
5120,Amazon Customer,0,30-Aug-14, ,I won t be buying again. When I opened my box inside the plastic the lid was broken open and about 1/4 was wasted. I think it would be easier if I would just buy at local stores buy me.

5122,JustMyTwoCents,1,21-Aug-13,21 people found this helpful,Before trying the CeraVe Moisturing Cream  I tried the?CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion  12-Ounce Bottle?which absorbed very nicely. However  I found the lotion to be a little light for the dry skin on my face.  I then purchased the cream which is really nice and creamy. A little goes a long way and although it is richer than the lotion  it absorbs nicely too. It leaves my skin feeling slightly tacky without feeling greasy.  My skin is looking noticably more hydrated after only a few days of using it. I am very satisfied using this moisturizer on my face. I am still using the lotion on my arms and legs where I prefer a lighter moisturizer.  PROS: - Rich and creamy... works well on my face - A little goes a long way  making the 16 oz jar quite economical - This leaves a noticable moisture barrier on my skin  but it is not greasy and doesn t rub off on my fingers.  CONS: - none
5123,Queen Christina II,1,06-Jan-17, ,A highly recommended cream. Recommended by a dermatologist for my daughter s great skin. It costs about $15 in the store and hard to find. A great price and really helps with extremely dry skin.
5124,in NM,0,15-Jun-18, ,If I d seen the ingredients before purchase I wouldn t have bought it! How can a company that purports to heal skin put known harmful ingredients in their cream?? No parabens in anything I will endorse!
5125,nikisoba,1,12-Feb-14,137 people found this helpful,I live in the dry Mohave Desert  and I m a cocktail server in a casino with dry recycled air  constantly washing my hands  in the winter. My hands looked like alligator skin! My knuckles were cracking and bleeding by the end of my work week  my nails were peeling and it was just ugly. I got this product thinking it would be for my face  but it was much too rich so I put it on my hands. I m not even kidding  within maybe 3 applications my hands were baby soft again. I came back to work and showed my coworkers and everyone had to touch my knuckles to believe it. And the effect really lasts! At the end of the night  my hands were still soft despite washing my hands all the time again.  Also... while this lotion is definitely too rich for me to use as a face lotion  I have been using it under my eyes with awesome results. My laugh lines are plumped up and not even noticeable. They weren t terrible to begin with  but if you re meticulous with your skin  you don t even want the tiny lines! I dab it on an hour or so before I get ready for work  and my under eye concealer just looks flawless. (A note: if you have BAGS under your eyes  don t use a heavy cream because it will just plump everything up. And don t use it on your upper lid if you don t want to look like you have baggy eyes. But if you have hollows or fine lines  you gotta try this.)  Not only would I buy this again  I am actually having it shipped to my boyfriend s house so he can use it too.
5126,M,1,23-Mar-12,2 people found this helpful,I am a regular swimmer (2 - 3 times per week  year round)  and have fun relaxing while I get a little exercise. The chlorine in the pools these days is high enough to require 3 - 4 suits or more per year  which has a big effect on my skin  as you can well imagine. I was looking for a product that would help to leach the chemicals back out of me and hydrate my epidermis. Advertised as a product for swimmers  I bought both the cleanser and the moisturizing cream. Both are very gentle and do soothe the skin. They do a good job of both removing the chlorine smell and moisturizing my skin  though I must do enough swimming that even this product finds it a bit of a challenge. Still  for its gentleness  ability to restore elasticity  and price  I would definitely recommend this product as suitable for those whose skin is exposed to harsh chemicals.
5127,K D,1,11-Apr-18, ,I’ve had laser treatments on face  this cream is very effective! I purchased after years of using $80 products. I found this on my own  through research. It WORKS.

5131,Art K.,1,13-Dec-12,One person found this helpful,... and I was skeptical at first  as I had very bad plaque psoriasis. This helped SO MUCH - don t get me wrong  it didn t  cure  it  but it did make it feel much better and stopped the skin from cracking.  Now my entire family uses it for moisturizing and I use it as maintenance for psoriasis. Having already tried almost every other moisturizer on the planet  I can definitely say this is something different.

There are so many better products out there  cannot understand what all the rave reviews are about. Even if it did moisturize  the stickiness is not worth it
5134,lagomorph,1,25-Aug-12,2 people found this helpful,I love having super soft smooth skin but it s hard to achieve bc my skin tends to get dry in the winter time. This stuff is like magic. With other creams/lotions I feel like I need to apply twice a day to get really great results. With this I can even skip a day and still have amazing smooth skin. I don t feel like I m always one missed application away from dry skin like I do with other lotions. Thick but somehow sinks in fairly well and it s non sticky/greasy. Love it for my face too. I ve bought high to low end  probably 50 different types of lotions at least searching for something like this. Amlactin is great too but it smells like ammonia and bc of that I don t like using it. There is another cream lotion with a pump that fits on this jar. I can t remember the brand but it s mentioned in makeupalley reviews on cerave so go there if you d like to find a pump that will fit on this jar.
5135,Rockin  Roz,1,11-Jan-13, ,It is very helpful. I was really getting frustrated because my Mom was itching and scratching so much. It is cold to the body as you apply it.

I was brought up on Eucerin  and always dreaded putting on the goopey/sticky paste (you can t touch anyone  any bits of lint or dust floating around the house stick to you  and it s just a pain). ALL THAT CHANGED WITH CERA VE! Recently I went to a new dermatologist and after chatting for a while he stopped me to say that using Eucerin in the winter can actually be BAD for me - that there is a certain enzyme your skin needs during the winter (not summer)  and to try Cera Ve. IT WAS A MIRACLE! Cera Ve is still on the heavier size of creams  but I would compare the consistency to vanilla pudding where as Eucerin is more like peanut butter. This cream has greatly helped my dry skin  it feels so light when you put it on (no more gooey/sticky)  and really it is such a miracle cream.
5141,ShineGlitterConfetti,1,03-Mar-15, ,My pedi recc this for my little one and her mild eczema and dry cheeks. Works like a charm!

5147,C. VanDyke,1,22-Apr-13,2 people found this helpful,I have very dry heels and have tried other creams  soaking my feet and then using a microplane. Nothing fully got the dry skin off my heels. I used CeraVe for two days  washed and planed my heels  and ALL of the dry skin was gone. When you use it on your hands  it stays for multiple hand washings  like a protective barrier. I m sold.
5148,Sara K Gering,1,17-Aug-12,3 people found this helpful,I first learned about CeraVe from my excellent dermatologist. I ve had problems with acne for over a decade [since early teenage years] and my skin in that time has transitioned from oily all over to quite dry in some parts  oily in others. I ve tried dozens of products to balance my face and stop the overproduction of oil that always resulted from over-drying my skin with acne products. This moisturizer has helped clear and balance my skin  used in combination with a time-released benzoyl peroxide [AcneFree foam!]. I get compliments on how glowing my skin is now.  Also  this product is an excellent value for the money and works better than moisturizers that cost 3 times this much.
5149,Natasha,1,03-Mar-13, ,I want to purchase it for myself. I bought it for my son. He swims and his skin gets very dry. This cream really improved his skin condition.
5150,coafer,1,17-Jan-12,10 people found this helpful,I had had Seborrhoeic dermatitis since I was a kid  and many treatments histories. The last time I went to the specialist was because I felt my face scarred and red  that became in this way when I moved from a different climate (humidity conditions). I started a treatment with Ketoconazole and I had good results  but every time I dropped the treatment thinking I was cured  the eczema appeared again. I was thinking that maybe the Ketoconazole cream for a long treatment would be a problem for my health too  so the last time I used it was complemented with CeraVe cream two times a day. I have to say that I dropped the Ketoconazole completely because applying on my face CeraVe one time a day in the morning was good enough for me. It seems to work even in my scalp. Due to my semi-bald hair cut  I could apply the cream on my head  and the eczema that usually gave me an intense itch and dandruff disappeared completely. I can say this is a very good product for the skin. Does not contains cosmetics or scent  and it is notably moisturizing. Now I can not live without this marvelous product that makes my skin look/feel better.

5162,Klaire Voyant,1,19-Feb-13,3 people found this helpful,I have severely dry skin.... to the point where my legs look like a desert landscape in the winter. I have never used ANYTHING that works as well as this product. Yes  it s a bit waxy  but who cares? I wish I would have taken photos of my skin before and after  bc my hands look at least 5 years younger than they did a week ago. My legs continue to get better  and I ve only been using it for a week. In that short time  I ve noticed a very significant improvement. I have no doubt that with continued use my skin will look 10 years younger before summer comes -- and when it does  I ll be ready.  I can t imagine NOT having this product on hand. I am completely sold on it.
5163,Max,1,04-Jan-13,2 people found this helpful,If you have dry skin problems leading to eczema  this may be a good solution. Apply a thin layer of CeraVe immediately after shower (within 2-3 min). Apply another thin layer after a few minutes. Makes the skin soft and provides the moisturizing effect.
5164,Kim L Harper,1,28-Jan-13, ,It really moisturizes well and I use it for myself and my daughter. I love Cetaphil which I have used for years  and can add CeraVe to my list.

5181,Cliff,0,24-Jan-18,7 people found this helpful,I decided to get a dermatologist-recommended skin cream so I purchased a HUGE jar of this. In the year 2018  why is there no safety protection for this product? No box  no shrink wrap  no tab that says  Do not buy if tampered with   not even a peel-off lid inside that you can throw away after you unscrew the top lid. It is totally and completely unprotected. This is extremely unsatisfactory in this day and age. I strongly recommend you fix this absurdly!!!

5187,Book Addict,1,31-Dec-13,9 people found this helpful,My dermatologist recommended this for my hands because I have dyshidrotic eczema. This works better than any other hand lotion I have tried. It is thick  yet once applied  isn t sticky. I can t abide any lotion that makes my hands slick. I can apply this  rub for 30 seconds  and it is fully absorbed and my hands aren t slick or sweaty.

5201,Dagger,1,29-Nov-12,3 people found this helpful,I started getting Eczema after I moved from CA to AZ. Dermatologist recommended this to me. Helps the dryness especially the cold/dry AZ winters. My wife even uses it when her skin gets real dry. I also use the AM/PM facial lotion which helps a ton as well. It s still a battle but at the very least prevents the painful skin cracking I used to get.

5204,Kathy Miller,0,06-May-15,2 people found this helpful,Causes me to breakout more. I purchased this after hearing many positive things about the brand online  but if your skin is sensitive to alcohol ingredients of any kind  there is a good chance this will irritate it. The increase in acne didn t happen quickly  and it wasn t until I stopped using it that I realized how much it had affected my skin.

5207,Christina Gutierrez,1,08-Aug-18,160 people found this helpful,Best stuff I ve ever chosen to  try . I ve had acne prone/oily/dry skin since my early 20 s. I have used EVERYTHING out there to help clear it up. Nothing worked. Or something would help the acne  but completely dry my skin out that it literally hurt to smile. Or I d use something to help with the dry skin  and my skin would go into rescue mode and create an immense amount of oil overcompensating for the dryness. It was frustrating  I was insecure. People who have had skin problems KNOW what I m talking about. I tried this last November  bc I d run out of moisturizer  and asked my mom if I could borrow some of hers. Neutrogena hydro boost was what she gave me to use that day. I first noticed after I applied it to my face  neck and d?collett?  how velvety my skin felt. And it was as if my skin just drank it up! Like it really needed it. So I applied a little more. Went to bed  woke up the next morning- my skin looked and felt totally different. No fabrication. No exaggeration. The texture was different. I had a glow. And even my acne wasn t as red  or aggitated looking. And had seemed actually slightly minimized. I began using it from that day forward and my cystyc acne has ceased  my skin is supple  clear  brightened. All I can think is that this moisturizer some how balanced the pH levels in my skin. I can t live without this stuff. It s fantastic.
5208,J Shackelford,1,09-Feb-18,185 people found this helpful,This is fantastic hydration for 60 & over skin. Neutrogena products have been recommended to me as an effective an affordable alternative to the high priced skin care lines. (I also use rose water mist in combination with this). Very light  goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.
5209,Noneya,1,29-Jan-18,203 people found this helpful,I have combination dry/oily skin and I got this after seeing the TV commercial and decided to try it out.  I ve been using this daily for a few weeks now and I really love it! It doesn t take much to apply to my whole face  dries quickly and makes my skin feel super soft. It also seems to be balancing out my skin- not super oily/dry anymore. I d recommend this if you have a similar skin type.
5210,Kyle Richardson,0,23-Sep-17,98 people found this helpful,(Review by McCall  using Kyle s acc) I really wanted to like this product. I have sensitive skin and prefer water-gel moisturizers heavily over thicker  creamy moisturizers. I used Clinique s Moisture Surge  but once that ran out I wanted to shop around for a different brand. Saw that this was a good dupe for the Peter Thomas Roth Cloud Cream and decided to give it a shot. Since day 1 (I ve tried it for 2 or 4 days now  I think)  every time I use it it burns on my face. And not barely-noticeable burning either. Like  I-need-to-grab-some-ice burning. The point of a water-gel moisturizer is to cool and soothe  but this does the exact opposite for me. Such a shame.
5211,Kayla Williams,1,03-Jan-18,121 people found this helpful,This is the first moisturizer I have ever used. I have oily skin so I never thought I needed to use a moisturizer. I didn t want to put something on my face that would add more moisture and potentially make it more greasy or worse  cause me to breakout. After reading and listening to several high reviews  I decided to give it chance. My skin can be a little dry in the winter  so it couldn t hurt. After one use  my face was moisturized but not overly moisturized and it felt softer and smoother. I like that this is a water based gel moisturizer and the fact it contains hyaluronic acid. I highly recommend this!
5212,Bennet G.,1,15-Feb-18,77 people found this helpful,Has a good consistency. very light. doesnt leave a sticky or heavy feeling like that of a cream or lotion.  I wished it were unscented. I dont want to be putting unnecessary ingredients on my face.  The packaging is also extremely excessive. the pot is way bigger than what is needed to hold the amount of product. Yes it gives it an expensive look and feel  but it s just not necessary. If it works  it works. theres no need for gimmicks and psychological marketing to try to sell this. we all know it costs pennies to manufacture.
5213,JustoP,1,03-Jan-18,73 people found this helpful,This is awesome. My head and face was extremely dry (during chemotherapy) and this cream worked great and feels refreshing when applied. I would strongly recommend
5214,Amazon Customer,1,25-Apr-18,55 people found this helpful,The first time I used this it gave a delightful tingling all over my skin  making it feel cool and fresh. There s no sticky residue  no overt fragrance (although still more fragrance than Garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue)  and there s no oily feeling at the end of the day. It s a bit heavier than the Garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue  and for that  I feel I can use the Garnier product twice a day whereas this product I only like to use once a day  but it feels like it s actually calming my face down  which calms me down. It feels like a mini-facial. I think as an indulgence  I love this product  and it is fantastic for oily skin - as it will keep your skin moisturized so you don t produce excess oil during the day - AND dry skin  so I highly recommend  but for a daily product that s also cheaper  my go-to is still the Garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue.
5215,Amazon Customer,0,31-May-18,47 people found this helpful,I used it for the first time today so can’t speak to its effectiveness....but I’m so disappointed it has fragrance and dye in it. The description says it’s fragrance and dye free.
5216,meems,1,10-Jun-18,31 people found this helpful,This is the moisturizer I have been waiting for my whole life. I have tried moisturizers from what feels like every brand - from the drugstore to the high-end expensive stuff at Sephora. This stuff feels incredible on my skin - it feels like a relief to put it on. It s not even remotely greasy  absorbs almost instantly  and has the lightest  cleanest fragrance. Other  heavier moisturizers left me with tiny clusters of new blemishes every morning (so frustrating)  but this hasn t clogged my pores at all  and my skin feels soft & plump. I also use this moisturizer to cut my CC cream/foundation to make it lighter (in body  not in pigment). LOVE!
5217,Jenny g.,0,22-Jan-19,27 people found this helpful,I think this is not the real product. It does not match the neutrogena product I have from the retail store. It has a scent and color. Fraud.
5218,Amazon Customer,0,08-Jan-19,21 people found this helpful,If you re buying this moisturizer because you have dry skin  DO NOT. I have extra dry facial skin during the winter and bough this thinking it would help. But it did not. It only made face drier so much so it started flaking
5219,s.cookie,1,15-Jun-18,15 people found this helpful,This was my first time trying a gel-type moisturizer and I loved the results! I have combination skin  and this helps hydrate my dry areas without making my T-zone too oily. Feels cooling and soft on the skin  doesn t break me out  and seems to be doing a great job at keeping my 30-something skin from getting too wrinkled. My only complaints are that I wish it came in a container with a pump (it s easy to contaminate with a jar like this  also I dropped it upside down once and lost some product) and I wish it came in a larger container - I have to re-buy frequently  but I do love this product and have gone through about 4 jars total so far so I do keep repurchasing - one jar lasts me about 5 or 6 weeks depending on how much I use it.
5220,Nikoa,0,12-Apr-18,16 people found this helpful,I have combination oily/dry skin  so I thought this would work pretty well for me. Unfortunately it caused my skin to flip out. I don t break out a lot normally but after using this for about a week my entire face was covered in pimples. After discontinuing using it for a few days  there are no new pimples and the old ones are fading. This was the only new product I added into my routine so it couldn t have been anything else.
5221,Jodi,1,11-Jan-18,17 people found this helpful,There s something really satisfying about using this product. The glass container is nice and the product has a light  fresh scent. Thee gel-like consistency is lovely and smooths over the skin very well. One drawback is that it doesn t provide sun protection  so you definitely have to use a sunscreen afterwards. I don t think it would work very well for anyone with dry skin  but it s really nice on normal to oily skin.
5222,Julie G.,1,31-Oct-17,17 people found this helpful,This gel works great. It goes on clear and smooth. Soaks in pretty well. It hydrates fabulously. I wear it overnight after I was my face at the end of the day. Only complaint is that it might leave my face a bit  too  hydrated as my forehead sometimes feels greasy in the morning. Using less product may help this.
5223,TT,1,01-Nov-17,18 people found this helpful,I’ve only used this for about one week now but all I can say is........I LOVE it! I honestly see a difference already. I love the smell of it! Sooooooooo worth buying! And  it’s cheap!
5224,Kate,0,03-Nov-18,12 people found this helpful,I had been using the extra dry hydro boost for over a year and loved it. I moved to a humid climate and figured I’d be better off with the regular hydro boost. Boy  was I wrong.  I’ve been breaking out like crazy - all over my face  neck  and chest after about 1-2weeks of use.  This hydro boost is heavily frangranced  which may be part of the reason I broke out. If you have sensitive skin I highly recommend using the extra dry version.
5225,Nurseshelly,1,06-Nov-18,7 people found this helpful,I bought this because I needed a water-based moisturizer to go under my makeup. I have super sensitive skin  so I was a bit hesitant to try it because up to now  one of the only things that has worked for me was Burt s Bees face cream for sensitive skin. I get perioral dermatitis from most face lotions or creams. I recently decided to try a water-based makeup (airbrush) to see if it would be better for my skin  and it requires a water-based moisturizer. This stuff is amazing  it feels so refreshing and moisturizing when you put it on  and then it soaks right in and it feels like there is nothing on your skin. It lasts all day. I put it on before bed and when I wake up  my skin still looks amazing  like I just put it on. The fragrance is really nice but so light it is barely noticeable  which is good for me because I dislike anything with a strong fragrance. I will keep purchasing this one!
5226,Emma,1,27-Jan-18,12 people found this helpful,LOVE this stuff!! I’ve searched everywhere to find something that will hydrate my face without making it oily and this product works SO great with my skin. Hydrates and moisturizes my skin without making it oily. I thought it wouldn’t last me long because of how little is in the jar but a little goes a LONG way! I only put a small amount on my pointer finger after I shower and I have enough to cover my whole face and neck. Works great  definitely buying again!!

5228,Aparna Agarwal,1,08-Jan-19,6 people found this helpful,I like this product over my Pond s winter face cream! It does help with taking care of the dry patches on the skin where foundations and concealers usually cling on! I apply it at night after removing my make up and cleansing my face and before applyin my make up in the morning! It does make the skin look plum and hydrated! I took one star off because there are still some areas on my face that even this product was not able to moisturize for example  the skin between my eyebrows and on either side on my nose! But these areas dont look as dry as they used to with other winter face products I tried! No breakouts! I have combination skin!
5229,Regina,1,27-Jan-18,10 people found this helpful,This is not my daily moisturizer. I use this on mornings where first thing is a 3 mile walk outside. It keeps my face moist without being heavy or greasy. It absorbs quickly so I can just apply it and go.
5230,Jael Holmberg,1,25-Jul-18,7 people found this helpful,Great for dry  sensitive skin. I’m almost 30 and have the struggle of trying to find something that is anti-aging & won’t cause a breakout (life’s not fair when you have wrinkles & acne). Just bought my second jar  my first from amazon  because I’ve never had skin that felt springy before - dry? yes. Bumpy? Irritated? Yes & yes  but never that healthy bounce. The HydroBoost sheet mask is a holy grail product too. It’s under $3 at Target.
5231,Amazon Customer,1,08-Dec-18,4 people found this helpful,Ok so as a regular user of HIGH END products I was originally skeptical of this Hydro boost moisturizer from neutrogena. I recently had my makeup professionally done for a wedding and voiced my concern of dry skin to my makeup artist. She used a beauty blender to apply this hydro boost mixed with a small amount of L’Or?al glowtion- I was WOWED!! (And purchased both) this stuff is remarkable!! I am VERY prone to breakouts and extremely sensitive to fake chemicals smells and fragrances. This moisturizer is absolutely heaven sent! A little goes a long way and it gives me a young youthful glow! I am sooo happy I found out about it and I must say it’s wonderful on its own AND under makeup!!! It is a wonderful product and at a great price point!!
5232,J G P,1,27-Mar-18,5 people found this helpful,My skin absolutely loves this cream. I first used this when I received a sample in a beauty subscription box. My first application was in the evening. I was immediately blown away at the texture and how quickly my skin drank it up. I thought there couldn t be much benefit from such a thin product  but then again  this is a Neutrogena product  so I shouldn t have been so skeptical.  My skin braved a Chicago winter armed with a great product that kept my skin moist. Can t wait for my other products to run out so I can replace them with everything from the Hydro Boost line. Thanks  Neutrogena.
5233,Willow,1,05-Jan-19,3 people found this helpful,I am a creature of habit with my face regimen. I ve noticed though as I ve gotten older  it might be time to try something else. I used Olay Complete - mostly because of the sunscreen and it is oil free. But  it hasn t worked well in the winter and I ve noticed my skin (although clear) doesn t look brilliant. It began looking dull. So....I bought this to give it a try. I AM SOLD. TOTALLY SOLD. This is so lightweight that you don t feel like you have anything on  yet my skin is smooth ad moisturized. I have a sort of glow now!! I was worried about the size of the gel - 1.7oz...hummm. How long would that last? Well  I use a tiny bit and it covers my whole face. So a little goes a long way. I need to investigate the sunscreen options  but I m sure glad I took a chance on this. Tremendous product!
5234,Megan D.,0,09-Mar-19,3 people found this helpful,I wish I had read the reviews on various websites before buying this. I have worked so hard to recover from literal decades of poor skin. I have not had a cystic pimple in 8 months. I will admit -- this made me cavalier. I found one water based gel moisturizer that I loved  and thought they were all like that. I was wrong. I used this for two days  and now I am scrambling to resolve skin care issues I haven t had for so long. And it is more disheartening this time around  because I feel like I have taken a huge amount of steps back because of this moisturizer. Do not even try this if you have sensitive skin. If you have combo skin that tends to get very dry on the cheeks and break out on the apples and the chin  do not use this. Don t do it. You will be so upset. If you have robust skin  it smells great and smooths on like a dream!!
5235,kcwoods,0,17-Jan-18,5 people found this helpful,never have an issue with anything on my skin. i am 52. have used Clinique products in past and never a problem. used other products for Rosacea in past and never a problem. this made my skin break out in 5 medium to large blemishes that were painful and red within 3 days. once i stopped using it about 3 days after that when i realized it might be causing the problem  thinks cleared up in another 4 days. love how it feels. it was recommended to me by a health professional  but it does not replace Moisture Surge at all.
5236,Brandi Owens,1,02-Mar-19,2 people found this helpful,I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin that is constantly in need of hydration  but I ve found 99% of moisturizers  cleansers  and lotions make me break out all to hell. My skin cannot handle anything even remotely oily or heavy. My skin hates me. But this right here -- Neutrogena Hydro Boost gel moisturizer is everything I could have ever wanted from a skin care item. It smells clean and you only need a little bit to completely cover your face and neck. It goes on smooth and absorbs within what feels like seconds  leaving you feeling REFRESHED. I have never had a break out or a bad reaction to it.  My mom and my younger brother both have seborrheic dermatitis and have been shopping around for a moisturizer that soothes their skin and helps with the sensitivity and the flakiness. BOTH of them have tried this moisturizer and ended up buying it for themselves after discovering it helped their skin condition so much.  I love this whole set. The cleanser and the moisturizer are part of my daily routine now.
5237,Meghan,1,19-Sep-17,7 people found this helpful,I love everything about this product. I have combination skin that is prone to closed comedones and starting to show signs of wrinkles (I m in my late 20s). The formula doesn t clog my pores and softens my skin significantly  including my lines. I m left with dewy  but not greasy  skin. Applying this gel every morning and evening makes me feel like I m at the spa -- the texture and smell is delightful.  In winter months I m guessing I will need to layer this with a heavier moisturizer just because my skin gets so dry  but I will definitely be using this gel year-round for the way it quenches my skin.
5238,Bowen,1,10-Jun-17,15 people found this helpful,It s very hydrating and smells lovely too. I decided to try it because most moisturizers clog my pores  but i haven t had that problem with this one. It feels like water on my face and it absorbs quickly without feeling heavy. I use it at night because I wake up with very dry skin and this stuff leaves it so plump and dewy. I just wish more came in the little jar  but it does last you a while  You only need a little at a time.
5239,Jonica Kao,1,15-Feb-19,3 people found this helpful,I have spent so much money on finding the right products as my face is VERY sensitive and prone to cystic acne breakouts. My previous moisturizer made my face all greasy after a full day outside. I was hesitant to try this product because I ve had poor experiences with gel-like products in the past. However  after reading the reviews  I decided to give it a try. I have been so impressed with this product! It instantly hydrates my skin but it does not even feel like I have moisturizer on due to how light it is. My face does not get greasy and the moisturizer lasts the whole day. I am so glad something finally works for me. This is my new favorite moisturizer! Highly recommend.
5240,olivia w,0,17-Nov-17,12 people found this helpful,I wanted to like this moisturizer since I ve been searching forever for something that can give my oily skin some moisture without the heavy and greasy. This is definitely light-weight  which I loved. Didn t care for it having fragrance  and there s a tingle when I applied it to my skin that I didn t really like either. But it didn t seem to do much. This may be because hyaluronic acid tends to work against you if you live (or work  as I do) in a dry environment. The AC in my office is always running  and many days I felt like I became even oilier than normal by the end of the day despite this moisturizer :( Perhaps I will try again  but the tingling was a put off. It goes away but it might have to do with my sensitive skin. Going to look elsewhere.
5241,Jade,1,31-Dec-18,4 people found this helpful,I really like this moisturizer so far! I have extremely dry skin in the winter  mainly because of the dryness of the air when everyone switches on the heat. Because I also tend to be oily  finding a moisturizer that helps my dry skin without making me even more oily is a struggle. I read about this online and then checked the reviews here  and finally decided to order it. The first day it arrived  I applied it 3 times because my skin needed the moisture. It made my skin so soft  and did not make me produce more oil. I haven’t had it for very long  but so far the results are great!

5243,Susan Thompson,1,20-Aug-18,4 people found this helpful,I LOVE how my skin looks and feels using this product. I ve never seen my skin look so naturally healthy. Since I started using the Hydro Boost line the skin on my face looks and feels plumped  and some of the spotty redness seems to have lessened. Not gone (that s just an age thing)  but I think the hydration has made it seem less noticeable.
5244,Michelle Rodriguez,1,21-Nov-17,5 people found this helpful,I live in the desert  so I keep mine in the refrigerator & when I put it on my face it feels refreshing. My face is soft to the touch after applying it and stays that way for an extended period. It has a subtle  clean smell which I like and find appealing. Highly Recommended because the price I think is very affordable and the product truly works well.
5245,Mark A. Samer,1,26-Dec-17,7 people found this helpful,Love this moisturizer! It is super hydrating  but doesn t leave the slimy after feel like most other moisturizing products. Definitely worth it!
5246,Amazon Customer,0,30-Jan-19,5 people found this helpful,The jar had been previously opened and it was clear it had been rewrapped. This is not only unhygienic but dangerous to put on your face.
5247,AmazonAddict,1,19-Dec-18,4 people found this helpful,I love this! I purchased this through Amazon on 12/7/18. I have been using this product and I love the way it makes my skin feel smooth and soft. There is no greasy feeling. I am prone to acne breakouts and I have sensitive skin. No skin irriations or breakouts for myself since I have used this product. I will purchase this again in the future.
5248,Eemn83,1,01-Apr-19,One person found this helpful,This stuff is the perfect example of a little bit goes a long way!! One tap of the finger tip will get an entire cheek or half my face. I was hesitant about paying so much for so little volume  but this stuff doesn t go fast.  I prefer to use this stuff at night  like after a shower before bed. It helps my skin from drying out from pillow cases. However  when i use it in the morning  I do find that it can stick around a little too much  and sometimes leave a slight oily feel? It hydrates really well! But might be best left for the dryer months if you use it as a morning moisturizer.  I also LOVE this stuff for when my skin is raw. Many lotions can sting a little  if you ve been scrubbing hard  or are wind-burnt. This stuff is SOFT and gentle  and I have been quite happy with how it feels on my skin.
5249,KLF,1,04-Mar-19,2 people found this helpful,I had bought the face mask version of this product and was impressed at the amazing hydration it gave my face. In an attempt to reduce plastic waste  I bought this jar of the moisturizing product instead and I’m so glad I did! I had some sort of rash develop in my face a couple of weeks ago (before using this product) and everything I tried was making it more flaky  itchy  and irritated. This has been the first product to actually help hydrate the area without irritation. This is bringing youth & moisture back to my face.
5250,Amazon Customer,0,23-Dec-18,6 people found this helpful,This broke me out in acne. Would not recommend if you have oily to normal skin. After 5 days of use my skin became extremely oily
5251,Johanna,1,20-Jan-18,12 people found this helpful,I have always loved any Neutrogena products and this did not disappoint me. It applies very smoothly and keeps the skin soft. I have read in some of the reviews that the gel had a tendency to dry out the skin but I had no such problem.
5252,Sheryl F.,1,03-Jul-19,,I tried this on a fluke. I thought what good is a water gel? Boy was I surprised. This is fantastic! Absorbs completely yet leaves skin soft and moisturized all day. I liked it so much I tried it on my dry arms. WOW! So good that I almost was willing to pay pace cream price to use on arms. Then I discovered they also make Hydro boost in body cream/gel and in body lotion and hand cream. I have now tried ALL of them and they all work great! I even started using the hand cream on my severely dry and peeling lips and I love it. I have now signed up for auto delivery of the hand cream and body lotion. If you have not yet tried Hydro boost  give it a try...in any form...it works great. I now use the body lotion everyday after shower. Also the body gel/cream on the feet works great to soften those cracked heels without leaving any residue on the feel so you can rub in hydro boost and immediately put on sandals. The only hydro boost I have not yet tried is the one for the eyes. Face water gel works great and I put it under eyes so I have not yet tried the separate one specially designed for the eyes. I have now tossed out all my other face creams and body lotions and only use Hydro Boost from now on.
5253,Amazon Customer,1,04-Oct-18,3 people found this helpful,I LOVE this product! I’ve never written a product review before but after using this product I felt that I had to. This product is ultra hydrating without making your face oily. I have struggled trying to find the right moisturizer for myself but I think I have finally found it. My face is combination and gets oily during the hot seasons and very dry during the cold seasons. I’ve been able to use this product all year round without having issues with being over oily or dry. This product also feels so good to put on my face because of the cool gel texture and fresh scent. I feel so refreshed after using this product

5256,Alyse,1,19-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,To this day I have been at war with the slick  slippery grease trap known as my skin. No creams  oils  lotions or serums have been successful in holding my grease at bay. Whether it is hot or cold  windy or humid  my greasy skin ALWAYS prevails until now. I have been using this moisturizer consistently for about 10 months now and I have to say that it is the ONLY moisturizer that actually works!!!! I used to think that you shouldn’t moisturizer if you have greasy skin but Issa lie folks. If you have greasy skin you absolutely SHOULD moisturize as lack of moisturizer makes your skin panic and over produce oils. With that being said  this moisturizer is successful because it’s a water based gel and right after toner and serums  I apply it and my skin sucks it up and is left feeling supple and dewy  not oily and dry  it works really well for daytime and nighttime and is very hydrating and calming. Sometimes if I have chemical burns or irritations the moisturizer may sting a little because of the hyaluronic acid inside but after a few weeks your skin is more supple  soft and hydrated. 10/10 recommend this product. The only downside is that it’s actually really small because it’s like a small bowl within the blue container it comes in and I go through this moisturizer every three weeks. I would recommend this to other local greaseballs like myself in an effort to win the war against oily skin!
5257,Kathy W,1,02-Aug-18,3 people found this helpful,This is hands-down the best moisturizer that I have ever used. It beats the Lancome moisturizers that cost over $100! I first tried the Hydro Boost water cream gel  which left a slight residue (maybe because it’s summer)  so I decided to try the water gel formula. IT WORKS! It really moisturizes dry skin without leaving a residue. That’s a first for me. I keep feeling my face because it feels so soft and non-greasy. I hope it works as well in the winter. If not  I’ll try the water cream gel.
5258,FooGirl,1,08-Nov-17,5 people found this helpful,This moisturizer is great for my oily  acne prone skin. It s light enough that my skin doesn t get oilier  but thick enough that it still feels moisturizing. I use it twice a day and I love how it feels on my skin.
5259,Nicole,1,07-Mar-19,,I have been wanting to try this moisturizer for a while but my local Ulta store always seemed to be out of stock since it s apparently so popular....then found it on Amazon at a better price  so ordered it a few weeks ago. Delivered quickly and tried it immediately....like the smell  gel/smooth consistency and ease of use. Soaks in quickly (able to apply make-up a few minutes later) but with the extremely cold/dry weather lately  my skin still feels a bit tight. I am 46 and have normal skin with no issues (no acne  rosacea  etc.) but perhaps I need more moisture/hyaluronic acid in the winter? Still seeing the lines right under the eyes when I smile...UUGGHH! Thinking this might be better for use in other seasons. Will probably buy again since I love the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Body Gel Moisturizer (same smell  consistency  etc.)…..
5260,Raisin,1,30-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,I am in my mid 50 s and blessed with good skin. The only complaint I have is that in the cold winter my face becomes very dry. I have used many products over the years to try and help my dry skin problem on my face with not much success. I saw this product and thought I would give it a try. I love it!! My skin is soft and not dry anymore. The scent is pleasant and the gel is so calming on the skin. Will definitely continue to use this moisturizer.
5261,Amazon Customer,1,22-Apr-19,,My skin has always been super sensitive so unfortunately I don’t have the best skin care regimen aside from prayer :)  I try things from time to time in hopes it’s beneficial for me and end up just wasting money:/  Not this time! This is amazing!!! I have bought the water gel (I use this in the morning if I’m not going to be outside)  the gel cream with SPF (used when planning on being outdoors)  and the gel cream for extra dry skin (at night for deep hydration!) - they all work with my sensitive skin and smell sooooo good!! Not to mention  each one is so breathable!  It’s so refreshing to have on my face and the confidence I have knowing I won’t end the day in a rash is just sooooo lovely!!
5262,The Wolf,0,11-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I bought this because the blue colored jar caught my eye. I thought it would be hydrating. Anyhow  the smell is extremely strong! I don t want or need any strong fragrances added to my face lotions. Ewe. I also am disappointed in its hydrating effect. It doesn t feel hydrating at all. I feel more hydrated by splashing water on my face than I do by using this stuff. I will never buy this again! It does absolutely nothing for my skin  and it smells horrid.
5263,Lil Lady,1,29-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,I love the way the product feels on my skin. It goes on very light and penetrates quickly. A little bit goes a loooong way. My skin feels totally hydrated  soft and supple. Although it is not as hydating as the gel-cream  it provides just enough hydration for mild dryness. I d recommend the gel-cream formulation for moderately to severely dry or tight facial skin like you might experience after a chemical peel or during Accutane use.
5264,RKR,1,09-Mar-17,6 people found this helpful,Get it. That s all I can say. I have oil/ combo skin with some dry spots from time to time. This moisturizers your face and it leaves your face so soft and smooth. Under makeup it does feel a little oily  but by itself it is amazing. I will definitely repurchase.
5265,Amazon Customer,1,02-Jun-19,2 people found this helpful,I went from very dry  flaky angry skin to soft and supple in about 1 week. I noticed a change instantly. My acne has even started clearing up. Keep in mind I also added vitamin E oil serum to my skincare routine at the same time. I highly recommend. The product is a great consistency  is cooling/calming  light  and has a pleasant smell.
5266,Matthew A Perdomo,0,02-Jul-18,3 people found this helpful,Amazon accidentally sent me this one instead of the one I normally order- this particular one has blue dye and perfumes in it hence my poor review.

I had a previous jar bought from a store never which never burned. I used the old remaining gel from store to test my theory...it did not burn. Used a little of the gel purched here and again the area where placed burned so bad  very painful! Be aware. Might want to test small area first.
5269,Lovlee Monica,1,27-Jun-19,,I have been on the hunt for a moisturizer that won t leave my face looking like i dipped it in oil every time. I have combination skin but i am very oily on my forehead and nose. I have a big forehead so it s so embarrassing when it super shiny. My face with other moisturizers always feel thick  heavy and simply oily.  Shipping was fast with prime next day delivery. The moment it arrived washed my face and applied it. INSTANT RESULTS. My face was immediately thoroughly moisturized BUT no OILY SHINY FACE. It feels SO LIGHT and refreshing on your face. And I kept checking every 2 hours to see if my oily forehead would conquer and no! I was conscious free for once about my bare face since i am currently am wearing no makeup for a while.  I currently am struggling with VERY dry skin because i over exfoliated so I have been applied two layers of this moisturizer every morning and one at night. It s my second day and my skin is already looking better. It also dried up a pimple overnight.  LOVE IT.
5270,Amazon Customer,1,01-Feb-19,One person found this helpful,For starters my skin is VERY sensitive and I have tried so many different moisturizer that were suppose to be calming for your skin. Most of the name brand products that are good for dry and oil skin only dehydrate / make my skin more oily. I m constantly going to the gym and I m very active  which is bad because my skin becomes even more oily/ dry. Sometimes I ve been so self-conscious of my skin because it becomes red from being dry and oil  it s been hard to go out in public  but not anymore!  This product form Neutrogena has been a live changer for me. It absorbs into your skin very easily and makes you skin very hydrated. This helped my face become less inflamed  less oily and dry. I now have the confidence to not worry about my skin anymore
5271,Victoria,1,16-Jan-19,2 people found this helpful,I was having dry patches on my face normally I have oily skin but I recently had a baby and my face is super dry!!

5272,Pennies from Heaven,1,09-Jun-19,,I love  love this product! I was using it for about 6 months  they left what little was left in the container for my mother to try. It truly goes a long way....only need to use a very little. Then I forgot to buy more and started using another product that I had laying around. About a week ago  I was noticing a difference in my skin and that s when I jumped on Amazon and purchased more. It hydrates the skin  it s light  not heavy and your skin feels so soft. Also  wonderful to use after being in the sun all day.
5273,Corey Shettles,1,08-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I am honestly super picky about moisturizer because I have very acne prone skin. Normally  I have had to buy really expensive moisturizer to prevent breakouts  but I really needed to save money and decided to give this product a try since it was so highly rated. My honest opinion is that this moisturizer is one of the best I ve used  especially for the price. The moisturizer isn t too greasy (it is a gel that is cool and refreshing)  and it gives my skin just the right amount of moisture and absorbs quickly. The only complaint someone might have is that it probably wouldn t help super dry skin because it s not thick and it does have that gel consistency. However  this is perfect for my situation and has been great in keeping my breakouts at bay.
5274,snm,1,29-Apr-19,One person found this helpful,My dermatologist recommended I try the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel with Hyaluronic Acid because people were seeing great results. I had used Eucerin face cream for years. My skin is dry except for some oily patches on the nose and some rosacea. The Hydro Boost is light and not the least bit oily  one of the advantages of it being a gel  rather than a cream. A little goes a long way and you immediately feel moisture being absorbed into your skin. There is also a version of the gel available with SPF 25 sunscreen which I just purchased. I highly recommend this product and hope Neutrogena never changes the formula!
5275,Amazon Customer,0,26-Apr-19,2 people found this helpful,This product came in a damaged box and didn t have the appropriate plastic seal layer between the cap and the lotion. This is absolutely NOT the real Neutrogena product - it is light blue instead of clear and has a faint perfume smell. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I thankfully had no breakouts or adverse reactions because I got suspicious and looked up reviews... washed my face right away.  The REAL product is very good - save yourself some hassle and get it at the drugstore.
5276,Jackie Renteria,0,05-Mar-19,2 people found this helpful,I loved how refreshing this Neutrogena Hydro Boost moisturizer feels on my face  but once that initial feeling goes away  my skin feels so dry. I started applying larger amounts  but it doesn t seem to help. I tend to apply this product 3-4x a day instead of once with the  all day  hydration this product tends to promote. I ve resorted back to using my Jergens lotion instead because that seems to help my skin stay hydrated a bit more.
5277,Amazon Customer,1,02-Oct-18,One person found this helpful,So as a guy it had been really hard to figure out what to put on my face without getting pimples or other blemishes.  I was using a CERA VE cream that my ex recommended  but I did not now that it was for the BODY and that it would clog my pores at night.  So I would wake up with pimples all the time.  I met 2 wonderful dermatologists at a tailgate of all places  and they recommended this for the evenings  a CERAVE cleanser  and a CERAVE sunblock for the day and the difference has been dramatic. (Note the review is from my son)  My face feels awesome and not greasy. And most importantly  no blemishes!

It ll take some consistent days for it to really help with the intense dry spots. But it ll come. Its refreshing and absorbs into the skin and leaves my skin so freaking soft. Dermatologist recommended it to me when I was having severe dryness under my eyes. But I use it all over my face. It s amazing.
5279,Krystahl N. Beshears,1,23-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,I LOVE this product!!!! I honestly can’t rave enough about it! Let me just say my husband was out of town for 4 days  when I picked him from work the first thing he asked was if I had gotten Botox that week!!! That is how good this stuff is. I have never been able to find a moisturizer that worked for my combo skin. I have dry and oily pimple prone skin that gets red spots occasionally. BUY IT!!!!!
5280,dreamcatchr,1,23-May-19,,I purchased this moisturizer late last year and loved it. I have combination skin and it makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated without leaving it feeling greasy or heavy. I was concerned because after not using this product for about a month until I could get a new one  when I used it again I broke out with little pimples all over my forehead. I was afraid that they had changed the formula but after a few days of using they cleared up and it doesn’t break me out anymore. This happened the very first time I used it as well so I think if you have sensitive skin like mine  you may need to let your skin get used to it.
5281,Madeline Bramer,1,06-Feb-18,2 people found this helpful,Love love this product. Not oily  not oil-clogging. Just the right amount of moisture for oil/combo skin. Smells good too! This is such a trusted brand  I will forever buy this product as my moisturizer.

5283,Lucypurr Mourningstar,1,01-Jul-17,3 people found this helpful,This moisturizer is excellent. I have incredibly oily skin and have difficulty finding a moisturizer that doesn t make me feel greasy or make my skin break out. It also doesn t have a scent to it so it helps with my sensitive skin.
5284,John,0,28-Mar-19,,The product packaging is way over-engineered and totally unnecessary  with sharp plastic edges in the plastic box that contains the product. That plastic box is not necessary in any way whatsoever and should not be a part of the product  since all it does is obstruct your access to the product.  It left a cut on my hand that has not fully healed more than a month later. The product is okay for the skin. But for the sake of your skin  use scissor s and falconier s gloves while opening this product. Will not be buying again since you are paying extra for a bunch of excessive and frivolous packaging that cuts you.
5285,jazemom3,1,28-Feb-19,,I LOVE the silky feel of this! It does not feel heavy like lotion at all. It absorbs quickly. I do not know it it decreases laugh line wrinkles as I ve only been using it twice a days for 3 days now. I just LOVE feeling it on my skin & can t wait for the next application. Maybe I ll take some selfie s soon  if nothing else than to give a God s honest  legit review. Other than all that  just know your face will thank you. P.S. I also use it on my neck  chest  and hands...

I definitely recommend both and will be buying again.

It smells amazing  absorbs instantly  and I have seen a drastic reduction in my cystic acne. It really does help retain moisture!
5290,DKW,0,20-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I have used the product everyday for about 4 weeks. My skin feels great when it is on my skin. However once my face is washed ... the product us gone. It never absorbs. It never has a lasting affect. My skin is actually dryer now than when I begin a month ago. I do not recommend the product.
5291,Jaden,1,27-Jan-19,,I purchased this moisturizer because I was out of my old one and needed a replacement quickly. This option had great reviews so I thought I d give it a try. I really like it - it leaves your skin feeling nice and quenched after using it  and it has not inflamed my acne-prone skin. However  I think the gel cream is a better option. The gel cream is a thicker consistency so it lasts longer and moisturizes more. Regardless  the Hydro Boost line is a great line!
5292,Kelly,1,14-Feb-18,2 people found this helpful,Product works well but has a very strong unpleasant smell to it. I actually stopped using it for awhile because I could not get past the smell. I started using it again at night and I must be getting used to it because it seems to be less intense
5293,Edward Holley,1,24-May-18,One person found this helpful,I have extremely sensitive skin and needed something to clear up my dry skin and this did the trick. It absorbs fast and leaves my skin so smooth and soft. I really like the gel texture it doesn’t sit heavy on my skin  I can even wear it under makeup and I usually can’t do that with most moisturizers. I hope this review helps someone else on the fence about buying it.
5294,Dayana,1,30-Jun-19,,Have tried so many moisturizing creams for my combination skin  but this one seems to work best for my weird skin - very light and gel-like texture and super moisturizing effect! Doesn’t clog pores  cause breakouts or allergy  which I experienced with other creams. I have tried the face mask and eye cream from the same Hydro Boost line and they are amazing too! However  when tried the Hydro Boost sunscreen  it caused a severe allergic reaction both with me and my husband.
5295,Sara C,0,10-Jan-18,18 people found this helpful,I love the Clinique Moisture Surge  so when this was recommended to me I decided to give it a shot as it s far less expensive. What a mistake! After the first use I had skin irritation  and after 2 days I was breaking out all over my face. This is going in the trash.
5296,Autumn,1,20-Dec-17,3 people found this helpful,Lightweight. Absorbs quickly. Not quite strong enough for winter weather  but will be using the other 3 seasons.
5297,darktiramisu,1,08-Feb-19,One person found this helpful,I love the blue  soothing color of this lotion. It smells very nice too and I have been using it for my journey with retin A. Needless to say  I don t think I m going back to any other moisturizers. This works beautifully and my skin feels so hydrated and does not become oily. I have both oily and dry skin  so this made a huge change. Keep in mind that lotion will encourage your skin to peel because of it lifting those dead first layers  so it is perfectly natural and is not due to the lotion not working. It keeps my skin hydrated longer and lasts for a while because it spreads so well too!
5298,Joy Brooks,1,22-Feb-19,One person found this helpful,This is absorbed into your skin very quickly with absolutely no greasy feel. My skin feels very soft and smooth after using it and it has a very pleasant light fragrance. Also a little goes a long way and I thing this jar will last for a long time.
5299,Fentibow,0,04-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I returned this item as soon as I got it. No sealing. Box was open  container was open... missing product. I’m very confused as to why I received a used moisturizer...? Anyway I heard great things about this moisturizer so quite disappointed I didn’t get to try it.
5300,Amazon Customer,1,23-Apr-19,,This is my favorite moisturizer! I have very oily skin in general  but I know how important it is to moisturize. Someone recommended I try a face gel instead of cream/lotion so I ordered this. It makes my skin SO SOFT  the softest it s been in a while  and did not cause any blemishes or breakouts. I use the clean & clear orange face wash (the one without the beads) and moisturize with this after & my skin has never looked better.
5301,Anna,1,27-Mar-19,,Im kind of split on this one. I have an EXTREMELY OILY SKIN so take my review with a grain of salt  my skin is sensitive to things in the area of breakouts and i do have cystic acne. This is...okay. My skin got used to it pretty fast but i still use it. However  recently i got very sick and the inside of my nose was so dry and raw that it was bleeding and putting this on the inside did magic... Not sure if that’s the intended use but it works amazing on dry patches or allergies or rashes for me. As a creme tho its just okay.
5302,Kelly,1,25-Nov-18,,I LOVE THIS GEL! Face feels so smooth and cooled  and especially clean as it isn’t greasy whatsoever. I dislike the small amount of gel and no larger size/lower price per oz. option. So for now  it’s a treat and just for my face. *One jar lasts a month for me. I get St Ives Elastin/callogen for the rest of me and it’s good stuff  too?but not on my face. Please make a larger size of this gel  for a friendlier and fair price. Thanks!
5303,AvidReader,0,20-Jun-17,3 people found this helpful,I really dislike the finish of this. It was very drying and did not provide enough moisture. I have normal/combination skin. Also  this started to break me out - possibly due to the dimethicone in it  which in my opinion is a totally unnecessary ingredient.
5304,Brian J. Ward,1,30-Dec-18,2 people found this helpful,Love this moisturizer! It’s lightweight and oil free. Keeps my face super soft. The best stuff ever made for my dry skin.
5305,Jennifer Snider,0,07-Jun-19,,Pros: Lovely texture  like sticking your hand into a cloud. A pleasure to apply. Fast dry down Smoothing  works well under makeup  Cons: Heavy scent Did not moisturize adequately for my dry skin Expensive by volume for the drug store  I picked this up last winter for a week-long trip to New York City (as my normal moisturizer is not TSA-friendly). I applied it faithfully every morning and evening. By the end of the week I had big flaky patches on my face. Not sure if my skin was irritated or just dried out  but my face was in good shape before the trip so it was a pretty dramatic downslide. Now it is finishing its life as a very fancy hand lotion.  Two stars for being aesthetically pleasing but can t justify more than that since it is a moisturizer that didn t... You know.... Moisturize me.
5306,LottieK,1,01-Feb-19,,Great lightweight moisturizer that actually moisturizes! I’ve heard great things about this product so I wanted to switch up my products and give it a try. So far so good! Using it in brutal Midwest winter and it’s doing the job! I imagine it will work well in the summer too as it’s so lightweight. I saw that there’s a new version with SPF so I will be trying that one next!
5307,Thecla Bethel,1,03-Oct-18,One person found this helpful,THIS PRODUCT ACTUALLY WORKS. If you know me you would know I had the toughest face to battle. Oily skin  a lot of acne..nothing worked. But since I started using this my face is cleared up TREMENDOUSLY. My face is soooo SMOOTH! My dermatologist recommended it and I’ve never looked back. I don’t even write reviews but I had to for this product. Don’t hesitate  go buy it now!. I’m on the way to Walmart now to get a new bottle because I don’t feel like waiting on the shipping lol. Also i suggest buying an Exfoliating brush (there’s some as low as $6 at Walmart) and the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Exfoliating Cleanser. Both together work MIRACLES. Thank me later.
5308,fox,0,27-Sep-18,4 people found this helpful,Really don’t like the smell  smells too much like perfume. Still have loads of dry spots
5309,SallyB,1,11-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,I just received this yesterday and so far I love it!! It just soaks into my skin and doesn’t feel sticky or greasy. I have mature skin and after one day  it already feels softer and looks better. I have been using a much more expensive cream  but think this is just as good or better!
5310,Lauryn,1,08-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,This gel has saved my skin! I ve had trouble in the past with finding products to keep my dry skin moisturized without causing break-outs  but this is an amazing solution. It is super lightweight - I tried the new Olay Whips creams that claimed to be lightweight  but I felt like I had a mask on my face for quite a while after putting it on. This gel cream has a great consistency (and a fantastic  fresh smell) I can t even tell there s something on my face after just a few seconds  it s so light! After putting it on  my skin feels like it was kissed by hydrating angels. ?? I just put it on after washing my face in the morning (with the HydroBoost cleansing gel)) and lasts all day  giving me a glowy  fresh look & feel.
5311,Allie,1,19-Jun-18,2 people found this helpful,This is the only moisturizer I wear! It goes on lightly and absorbs quickly to keep my dry skin at bay. I live in a tropical environment so anything that doesn t make me sweat even more is a must-have.
5312,DanaL,1,31-May-19,,I bought this based on reviews and while it works fine  it s not incredible in any way. It didn t quickly help with my winter dry skin. I have extremely sensitive skin too and it did NOT bother me. That s a plus. I do like that it dries quickly before applying makeup. It s a great every day moisturizer. I was looking for something to cure my winter dried skin. It didn t help there  but I do think it s a good every day moisturizer and it didn t bother my incredibly sensitive skin.
5313,Amazon Customer,1,29-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,I have struggled with acne for YEARS. This has changed my face greatly. My dermatologist actually recommended this. Super light and a little goes a long way. I work in the medical field and tell everyone about this. It s made such a bigger difference for me. A little pricey but worth it. I will never go back to face lotion. Now that it s winter I was worried it wouldn t be strong enough but nope! Even with dry winter skin it s amazing. If you re on the fence about this stuff  it s 100% worth a try and your money.
5314,Cinderella,1,10-Sep-17,3 people found this helpful,This neutogena product is the real deal?? My face and neck are softer  the wrinkles seem less apparent and my skin softer. I rubbed some on my arms out of curiosity and unlike all the creams saying they would erase my creepy skin  this product did erase them. I love this product and sent this and the lip treatment to my sister.
5315,Linds,1,17-May-18,One person found this helpful,I always went high end with my facial/cosmetics products. But I was nearing the end of my moisturizer and saw the commercial for this. I jumped on Amazon to see if they had it. I got it quick and the main thing is it hasn t broken me out. And  it feels lovely on your skin. I highly recommend this.
5316,HPM,0,24-Sep-18,2 people found this helpful,Looked like the packaging had been opened. That made me feel uncomfortable with using the product in case it had been contaminated. Pen marks and small damage to outside of box. Otherwise generally this lotion is good for those with very oily skin. Try spraying toner or rose water before and after application. This lotion will bind and hold that moisture in the skin
5317,Johnese M.,0,24-Feb-19,2 people found this helpful,I don t like this one at all. I decided to try it over Clinique because it was less expensive. Well I guess you get what you pay for. This product does nothing to add moisture or maintain little moisture in my skin. I stopped using it after a week. It was a complete waste of money.
5318,Cathy A. Krinjeck,1,21-Jan-19,2 people found this helpful,I was reading a magazine about two years ago and a leading New York City dermatologist recommended this product; I thought I would give it a try. I have been using it ever since  wonderful product. I attribute it helping diminish fine lines around my eye area and a much different texture  my skin feels hydrated and soft.
5319,amazonshopper,1,05-Jan-19,,Love this stuff. The consistency  the gel/cream  the hylaluronic acid  feels so nice going on. Love the results - smoothing  a little plumping  like it for my undereye darkness. Why do we need fragrance though in a product like this though  especially from Neutrogena? They make hydro boost in a body lotion too which is also awesome and even a hand creme. Love the hydro boost line!
5320,MeganW,0,02-Feb-19,One person found this helpful,I am on the fence if this is the real product. It has looks like it has a blue tent and it has a floral fragrance NEITHER of which were in the one I bought from the store... it’s also heavier on my skin.
5321,Drool Bean,1,24-May-17,3 people found this helpful,Excellent product. Does what it says. Hydrates your face  plumping your skin to erase fine lines. This will not remove deep wrinkles  but is great for everyday hydration. Great price from Amazon. Can t get it this cheap in the stores.
5322,JFI,1,31-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,This is a fantastic water gel! I still use this product on occasion to hydrate my skin  as I have recently reorganized my skin care regime. However  this makes skin incredibly soft  hydrated  and prepped for makeup! It smells amazing and even my boyfriend uses it! The only slight negative is that it s a fairly small jar but for around $20  it is well worth the money!
5323,Amazon Customer,1,25-Jun-19,,I’ve been looking for a moisturizer to help with my oily combination skin. I have psoriasis and can’t use anything to scented or stuff that will dry my skin out. After using for a month you can definitely see the difference. I was using blotting papers and no longer need them. I use this in the morning before I put my makeup on and at night before bed. It’s improved my dry skin and has helped control the oil. I will be purchasing again.
5324,April,1,10-Nov-17,2 people found this helpful,Amazing! I love how refreshing this product is. It is not sticky or greasy at all. I have combination skin  and when I feel super dry  I put it on and feel renewed. A little goes a long way so the 1.7 oz is a great deal! Totally worth the price!
5325,TonicShopper,1,07-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,I love this moisturizer! It is the best thing I ve put on my face so far. The only thing I don t like is the fragrance. Honestly  it could do with out it. Other than that  AWESOME. leaves your skin so soft!
5326,Audrie H.,1,02-Sep-17,7 people found this helpful,Love this water gel! I m in Central Florida and with the heat and humidity it s important to have a light product that doesn t feel too heavy. This gel absorbs quickly and leaves my face super soft and smooth and the perfect foundation for my makeup. A lot of other lotions I have tried in the past has made my face get really oily and shiny after a couple hours with my makeup on but this one does not do that at all. I absolutely love it and I m on my second jar of it! I m in my late thirties and the fine lines and wrinkles are creeping in but this product does a good job with hydrating and getting rid of some of the finer lines.
5327,Tippsterr,1,07-May-18,One person found this helpful,As usual the stuff is great  I have super sensitive skin and dry skin. I immediately put this on out of the shower or washing my face. I pair this up with many other moisturizer but this is a good base to have under my SPF etc. Summer or winter my skin has no preference it is always dry/dehydrated.
5328,Elizabeth Siesel,0,16-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,I don t know if the formula was updated  or if I grabbed the wrong product... but the water gel I had been using was unscented  and it wasn t actually blue. This stuff has a scent that reminds me of kitty litter :( I ll tough it out and use the rest to not be wasteful  but I won t be buying it again.
5329,Dale J.,1,23-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,Really nice product. Not greasy  doesn t seem to clog the pores  a jar last a long time and reasonable price. I use it fairly regular (at least 4 times a week) and after a week I really started to notice a difference. I have been using it for a couple of months now and have no desire to try anything else.
5330,Sgt. Scott Rickert,1,18-Feb-19,,I use it after washing my face and shaving and it has worked great so far and I have extremely sensitive skin. This is the first moisturizer besides Cetaphil that has ever worked without turning my face red and making it sore. I thought the Hylaluronic Acid on it would be a non starter but it has worked. I hope it continues to work.
5331,the style,1,16-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,I ve been using this product for over a year because it makes my skin feel so supple in the morning. This moisturizer applies easy without a greasy feeling and has a nice subtle scent.
5332,Zneerg Johnson,1,21-Feb-19,One person found this helpful,This is my second jar and I love it. I hate regular creams and lotions  they smother me. This gel goes a long way and makes skin so soft  no stickiness either.
5333,Sarah R.,1,30-May-17,One person found this helpful,This works very well on my combination skin. I use Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair SPF 30 lotion in the morning and this at night. I have used both on my face and neck (don t forget your neck  it needs moisture too) for about a month now and my skin looks and feels much better. No more flaky dryness or shiny spots. Better than more expensive lotions I have tried. Definitely recommend.
5334,D. H.,1,06-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I put this on at night and it helps my face from dry skin issues due to winter. Not too greasy and doesn t break me out at all. And I have very oily skin.
5335,Nannyfran,1,23-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,My daughter s dermatologist recommended this for her  and I decided to try it for myself. I have tried many types of moisturizers and this is one of my favorites. It goes on light and makes even my very oily skin feel fresh. After using it for a few months I feel and see a huge difference in my skin. It is soft and more supple. I highly recommend it!
5336,C. Pride,0,14-May-18,2 people found this helpful,My friend uses this and she really loves it so I wanted to give it a try. Well  I broke out horribly and ended up returning this to Amazon.
5337,Kevin Teeter,1,26-Oct-18,One person found this helpful,This stuff is amazing. I have combination skin that s extremely picky and sensitive and almost all moisturizers break me out and make me oily  and if I don t use a moisturizer  my skin gets extremely dry and irritated. This product keeps my skin smooth and moisturized  not irritated or oily  and I really like the smell. I would definitely recommend.
5338,ERICA MORENO,1,21-Dec-17,2 people found this helpful,I have reordered this about 3 times now. I love how hydrating this is. I have oily skin. So this helps minimize the oil since it is water based.
5339,Queen D,1,25-May-19,One person found this helpful,I have sensitive acne-prone skin and this stuff is great! No breakouts and keeps my skin nice and moisturized! 10/10! Highly recommend!
5340,Jan,1,30-Jun-18,,It s not oily  and does not smell of anything  not that I know if there s any added fragrance. It does what I need it to do  keep my face moisturized. Wish it was cheaper but obviously that s not on Amazon. I recommend  but of course it might not work for you. My face feels nice after application  though it burns somewhat if my face is very dry.
5341,Teri Mears,1,21-Apr-19,,I have very sensitive dry skin and this is by far the best moisture cream. I apply it generously but it sinks into skin. Most moisturizers either leave me feeling greasy or irritate my skin  this does neither. I had to buy from Amazon because Walmart now only carries version with SPF which I cannot use.
5342,Phyllis,1,06-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,Best!! I’ve been using this on my face  neck and chest for 3 years. I can see how it’s protected my skin. I use it every Morning and Evening. I highly recommend this product.
5343,Ryan L,1,17-Jun-19,,I love this product. I usually use a much more expensive product in place of this but decided to give this one a shot because I’ve heard great things. It’s a great product! I use it before I put on my regular moisturizer and it really hydrates my skin. At first I was a little put off by the scent because it reminded me of baby powder  but I’ve come to love it.
5344,Eye Kay,0,15-Feb-19,,I really wanted to love this product because so many people rave about it  but...no. I initially felt like my skin was softer  but I also started breaking out after using this gel moisturizer. I even took a little break from it just to see if it was really the product s fault  and it in fact was.  It could ve just been me  but issa no for me  and it will probably be a no for you if you have sensitive skin.
5345,MKM,1,18-Apr-18,,For me  my face is VERY sensitive to almost every moisturizer out there. I’ve tried most products designed to use with sensitive skin and Eczema. My wife actually bought this and wanted to try sone on my skin. She really like it but ai was reluctant because normally creams and lotions react to my skin and my face turns bright red. No redness or reaction from me with Neutrogena Hydro boost and my face got the moisturizer it needed. Try it.
5346,Leilani,1,12-Nov-18,,My face is now so firm you could bounce a quarter off it. It wears well under makeup. I was having major peeling issues from retin-a (for wrinkles  not acne) and this is the first stuff I ve come across that will hold my skin together so I don t look gross and peely when trying to wear makeup  and it doesn t clump up either.
5347,Nina,1,21-Feb-16,4 people found this helpful,I love using this face moisturizing gel. It absorbs and dries quickly  without leaving the sticky feeling of lotions and keeps my face hydrated during the day. My boyfriend likes it a lot and keeps stealing it too. It has a fairly light scent which dissipates quickly as it dries on the face.
5348,Amazon Customer,0,25-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,Felt great going on and I thought I was going to love it. Unfortunately it made me break out horribly (stopped using for a week and re-tested it just to be sure). Never again - this stuff is going in the trash. Yuck.
5349,Tiffani C.,0,05-Jun-19,,Not using it again. It not that I found out I had some allergic reaction to the moisturizer that is the issue. The issue was that I need to put on layers of the moisturizer for my dry skin to feel healthy. Then my face felt it was on fire. This product was not for me at all.
5350,Size 10,1,21-Apr-17,2 people found this helpful,Amazing hydartion. My skin is extremely dry so I apply it 2 to 3 times a day. But for its price it really good. I cant afford to invest in expensive products so this is a good alternative for extremely dry skin like mine. I combine it with some coconut oil and boy does it do wonders.
5351,CJ H.,1,10-May-18,2 people found this helpful,Uses the same active ingredients as high-end serums. My skin feels like it drinks this up. It leaves it soft  hydrated  not at all oily. Absolutely recommend; just wish it had SPF
5352,Sandy Feete,1,28-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,What a wonderful difference in the hydration of my skin! My eye lids are not crinkly now and cheeks are soft and plump. Love the gel formula too.
5353,Lynette Harman,1,08-Sep-18,One person found this helpful,Love this product. I haven t used anything else in four years since I stumbled upon it. It all about the hyaluoric acid. You have to use products with ingredient. There are others but I like this product the best.
5354,Seth Gillett,1,20-Dec-18,,I had really bad acne for a while  and this was probably a result of me not moisturizing after washing. I had the mistaken impression you needed to dry out your face as much as possible in order to prevent pimples from forming. Even after a cycle of acutane  I was still getting breakouts so I decided to try moisturizing. That and drinking lots of water really helped my acne  this product does a really good job keeping my face from drying out after washing and it s lasted me at least a semester of college and I still have some left.
5355,ShaneB,1,06-Mar-18,,This winter has been brutal  especially here in Oklahoma with the high winds  dry air  and really low wind chills. This product saved my skin from looking like an alligator purse. I ordered it again because it is just that good. I have read some complaints that you don’t get enough in the jar which hasn’t been my case and I have two of them & put it on more than twice a day.
5356,KF,1,21-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,Love it. A little goes a long  long way. Just a dab on the tip of your finger moisturizes your whole face and neck. No thickness or oily consistency. Has a nice light fragrance as well.
5357,Laurie,1,10-May-18,2 people found this helpful,Love this stuff! My skin is so much smoother and moisturized! This gel is not greasy feeling at all  and it absorbs really quickly. I will definitely buy again.
5358,Stefanie O,1,24-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,I use this every night. It’s been amazing! I can’t live without this now. I have such dry skin and I really feel it has made a difference in not only how my skin feels  but how it looks as well.
5359,DENISE M.,1,30-Oct-17,One person found this helpful,Yeeessss neutrogena! this moisturizer is wonderful. My skin feels so great after using this product for only a short time. This product when you put it on feels like... creamy water! Honestly thats the best way to describe it. Thank you neutrogena im a hydro boost customer for life!
5360,Samantha,1,30-Mar-19,,I started using this because I’m 30  my hormones brought me acne  I have scars from it  and I’m tired of wearing so much makeup to cover this! I added this to my facial routine and I have not gotten any break outs. It’s light weight and not oily. I love it!
5361,Kalani Gonzales,1,14-Sep-17,One person found this helpful,Literally the best moisturizer for oily skin. Feels weird when you put it on because it s a different texture. But it s cooling and refreshing. Doesn t leave oily residue like some moisturizers. A little goes a long way
5362,UrOldLady,1,15-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,My skin is exceptionally dry  my dermatologist said  keep moisturizing  day and night. The hyaluronic acid really works and the gel feels wonderful on my face. Why spend more when Neutrogena has nailed moisturization with their Hydro Boost product?
5363,windiciti,0,25-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,Inexpensive. Cream is light and quickly absorbed. I saw no visible results  and decided to stick with my trusted L Oreal Day Cream  which also has good SPF protection.
5364,JZamora,1,02-May-19,,Omg this is mine and my husband’s favorite face cream! My husband had dry spots on his face and asked me for a lotion. I said here use this and now he’s just as hooked as I am! We don’t use anything else anymore. Doesn’t have much of a smell at all and the feeling is awesome! Good price  too.
5365,Emi,0,24-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I cannot remember a time my face was flaking so much. My skin is dryer than back before I used face moisturizer at all.
5366,Semra S,1,14-Apr-19,One person found this helpful,I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have very sensitive skin and hate to feel something heavy especially on my face. This product is weightless and airy I love the way it makes my skin feel.
5367,HP9393,1,23-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,Very great product that is exactly as described. After two days in a dry climate  my skin looks glowing again!!
5368,glassbottomboat,1,18-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,This lotion is great for not breaking out my super sensitive skin and feels soooo nice when you apply it  but I end up needing to add jojoba oil or Cortizone 10 to it to make it moisturizing enough. I m just going to continue to use it as a base to add stuff to.
5369,Sadie,1,01-Jul-18,,It seems a little strange to use this moisturizer that is not marketed for oily skin  on oily skin  but it works! I have severely oily skin and this doesn’t break me out  keeps my oil controlled. And doesn’t make my face flaky(there’s nothing worse than being oily but with flaky skin). It also helps extend the life of my makeup!
5370,Missy Miller,0,03-Feb-19,,I really wanted to like this moisturizer. When I first opened it I smelled it and right away I didn’t like it  I think it stinks but I still tried it and after I did....it made my face burn especially on my checks & under my eyes. It also didn’t do anything for my face. It didn’t make it feel soft. I won’t be putting this on my face again.
5371,J. T.,1,13-Oct-18,One person found this helpful,The whole family loves this. It s lightweight but works so well. It basically melts into your skin. My husband bought it for himself and I end up stealing it.
5372,ju,1,14-Dec-18,,This is a wonderful moisturizer. I was using some from It Cosmetics and for me it is just too greasy. This goes on like a dream and a little goes a long way. When I received it  I put it on the backs of hands and was amazed at how soft they were. I recommend this and will be repurchasing.
5373,Sally Bidwell,1,29-Nov-18,,I LOVE this lotion. I have fairly sensitive skin and this gives my skin a lot of moisture and glow without breaking out. I use the Face Gel in the summer or on humid days  and the Gel Cream in the winter and dry days. Would give 5 stars  but I do think there should be more product for the price.
5374,AZBunny,1,07-Aug-17,One person found this helpful,I live in the high desert Southwest and I m a senior. This gel absorbs quickly and helps to prevent wrinkles and roughness. I use it after washing my face and only patting the face dry. The slight moisture on my skin and neck helps to spread this gel smoothly and without needing to use a lot of product.
5375,Madison Harris,1,26-Jun-19,,Curology recommended this product because I hated the moisturizer it came with. I was not working for me and left a weird texture on my face. This stuff really soaks into the skin and leaves my skin looking radiant. It is great under makeup as well. I pair it with the ELF poreless primer that works wonders. I use this moisturizer and primer together when I don t want to wear makeup and it makes my skin look flawless. Obviously  because I use Curology  I do not have good skin  so that says a lot!
5376,Salim,1,08-Mar-19,,I am a 30 year old male. After seeing so many reviews I decided to get this product because I wanted to start taking care of myself. The bottle is in a decent size. You really don t need that much to apply on your face. It hydrates your face instantly and lasts for many hours. I like applying it in the morning when I wake up and before bed. Now this product I had no allergies whatsoever from it. It actually made my face look more healthier and cleaner. Keep in mind that what works for some may not work for everyone. Some may be allergic and some not. Before using talk to your doctor if your are unsure.
5377,mom of 3,1,09-Dec-17,2 people found this helpful,I love this moisturizer. I usually get my moisturizers from the make up line I wear but they stopped carrying the kind I liked so I started to look for other brands. I love Neutrogena’s face wipes  I use them every night to remove my make up  so I thought I would look for a moisturizer in their brand and I happened upon this. So glad I found this and took the chance. Try it  you will like it!
5378,Amazon Customer,1,25-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,After trying all the high-end gel moisturizers  this has become my favorite that I use daily. It s very light weight (even lighter than the Belief one that is a bestseller at Sephora) which is great for my oily skin. I highly recommend it and the price doesn t break the bank.
5379,Cloud,1,12-Sep-17,2 people found this helpful,When you can see the results that s when you know you have a winner and I will definitely say I can recommend this to everyone. It s not greasy or oily and gives your skin a youthful appearance!
5380,Betty,1,07-Aug-18,One person found this helpful,Although I always read reviews this is the first one I’ve ever written for a product. In just two days I have seen a remarkable improvement of my skin. I’ve spent so much money over the years trying moisturizers from high end makeup manufacturers that I am thrilled to find something that is reasonably priced  but priceless to me!
5381,Amazon Customer,1,15-Aug-18,One person found this helpful,I have tried so many affordable facial moisturizers and none have worked. They have never helped my dry skin and have made my face so oily! This stuff immediately hydrates my skin and is not oily at all! I swear by it!
5382,L. Logan,1,01-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,This is a good  solid moisturizer. It isn t heavy and it doesn t make my skin feel greasy. It is a gel-like moisturizer rather than a cream. It doesn t stand up to winter weather  but it s perfect for fall  summer  and spring in Georgia!
5383,Grammylove*****,1,17-Oct-18,One person found this helpful,No more dry itchy legs for me anymore. I have Neutrogena Hydro Boost  and I use it everyday to get rid of the annoying itch that comes with winter in Wisconsin. Don t let the size of the bottle fool you; a little Neutrogena Hydro Boost goes a long way  You ll feel the cool water base as soon as you smooth it on your skin. It is absorbed right away by your driest skin and it lasts all day. I hope you ll try it. Pamper yourself. You will love it!
5384,RACEHORSE,1,29-Nov-18,One person found this helpful,I use this product for my extremely dry face. During the winter my face gets so dry it peels  but after finding this product I haven’t had any issues since. I have also sensitive skin and this moisturizer does not make me breakout whatsoever. If you need a deep moisturizer that doesn’t leave your face oily give this one a try. Definitely 100% recommend.
5385,Amazon Customer,0,28-Dec-18,3 people found this helpful,Broke me out
5386,Raza B,1,07-Jun-19,,My fav moisturizer. This just absorbs into skin in no time and instantly giving a hydrated feeling. Doesn t leave the tacky sticky feel like other moisturizer. Very good for summer. If you dont like lotion or cream like feel on skin  look no further  this is amazing product.
5387,Jackie,0,29-Jun-18,2 people found this helpful,It doesn t keep my skin as moisturized and I d like  there are still flaky areas.
5388,Justin,1,02-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,Best moisturizer ever! This is the only one I’ve ever used that didn’t leave my skin feeling oily after.
5389,Valerie A. Lindsey,1,24-May-18,One person found this helpful,Love this product even more than Oil of Olay! It feels so wonderful on the skin and is absorbed quickly. Nice to have a moisturizer that isn t heavily perfumed. The scent is mild and pleasing
5390,Madeline,1,30-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,I have used all manner of face creams and this is the best one I have ever used. I recommend it to everyone  and my friends all use it now as well. Whether you have dry skin  oily skin  combination  etc  this product keeps your face hydrated and happy all day. It doesn t boast any crazy results or over night fixes  just maximum hydration for your skin without any residue. And it 100% delivers.
5391,Asia C.,1,01-Jul-18,,I have extremely oily skin. Moisturizers usually make it worse but so does not using one. I watched a review of the product on YouTube and decided to try it. The texture feels amazing on the skin and doesn’t leave an annoying  lotion  feel since it is a gel. Definitely keeping this in my routine.
5392,Scott Vaughn,1,13-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,doesnt leave my face all shinty  which is great. but its moistens seriously perfect. love it so much  i bought more :-)
5393,Catherine,0,15-May-19,,Do yourself a favor and don t waste your money  just spend the bit more and get Clinique Moisture Surge. I wanted to try this to see if I could save a few bucks...I did save money but this product does nothing. It s just blue colored goop. No moisturizing benefit. Won t buy this again.
5394,Meghan W,0,30-Apr-18,3 people found this helpful,don t use this. I love Neutrogena products  but this one was a fail. The hydroboost products dry my skin out  make me break out  and seemed to age my skin like crazy.
5395,April Sullivan,0,28-Sep-17,2 people found this helpful,Feels nice at first bit it is mostly just a sealant and doesn t seem like it actually gets down into the skin. After 3 days of use my skin looked very dehydrated.
5396,Nya,1,22-May-19,,I have been using this for a few weeks and definitely like it. It s very lightweight and does not have a greasy feel like most moisturizers. It s truly water based and transparent. There is no film left on your face. Love it so far!
5397,Jenna Finn,1,28-Apr-19,,I LOVE this moisturizer! I have naturally oily and troubled skin  the fact that this dries on matte is amazing  and it moisturizes my skin very well. Been using this for a few months and I m in love! A little pricey  but it s worth it!
5398,Olivia Williford,1,16-May-19,,I have extremely sensitive skin and I struggle with my oily complexion. This moisturizer doesn t add too much to my face and does an A+ job at moisturizing. The only downside is that this is so expensive.
5399,Karen Graham,1,27-Apr-18,2 people found this helpful,I love this product! I was so tired of putting moisturizers on my face (lots more than the directions said) to have my face feel dry and too tight five minutes later. When I tried this Neutrogena product my face felt hydrated and soft the whole day. Now I use it night and day and love how my face feels.
5400,Amazon Customer,0,23-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I’ve come to the conclusion that the reviews are all paid because this stuff wrecked my face. I mean WRECKED it. It dried it out horribly and I just used a little at night then once the next morning and it made me breakout worst than I ever have. Spent most of the day crying so thanks Neutrogena!
5401,Elise Braun,1,05-Feb-18,One person found this helpful,This is my first ever Amazon review. This is hands down the best face cream I’ve ever used. I’ve been using face creams my entire life that leave oily residue on your skin that end up clogging pores and causing breakouts. With this product  you simply apply a thin layer evenly over your face  and your pores will just soak it up leaving a smooth  even finish with absolutely no oily residue. If you use this product everyday  you’ll go through this container quickly  but it’s worth it - especially for those with oily or combination skin.
5402,Jean E. Henderson,1,06-Jul-15,3 people found this helpful,Love it! I have always had very good looking skin even with in being  oily skin.   even into my into my sixties! Didn t think acne ! 40. For the past 2 years  my skin changed and I was shocked to realize it dulll & dry. This stuff made a my skin feel fab but firm. No love touching my face. It s only been five days of use twice a day.. Good price too!
5403,Nikole Rivera,1,07-Mar-19,,Love how this feels after you put it on. I was getting really dry patches on my nose and tried a bunch of different masks and moisturizers  this so far has worked the best. You only need a little bit  it goes a long way! So this should last a while too!
5404,Roland,1,03-Jun-19,,Overall the product is great! I do get a little burning feeling and have only had red spots from irrational once! My only problem is the smell  and for some it may not bother them at all. I find that the scent of this moisturize is exactly how portia potties smell. It makes me almost feel gross putting it on. I tried to mix in my face essential oils to give it a better smell  but it didn t help. It may be just a me problem  but I can t get the idea of portia potty while putting it on my face!
5405,Jenny,1,21-Dec-16,2 people found this helpful,This is seriously the best face moisturizer I ve ever used! A little bit goes a long way  so the price is absolutely worth it. My skin showed improvement in 3 days--no more winter dryness  and no more clogged pores or oiliness throughout the day.
5406,S. choice,1,22-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,Ok this stuff is like water in a jar. I can feel my skin hydrating.....Everytime I go for facials they tell me I need ore hydration. I can’t wait to go and see if there is a difference.
5407,DGMelekos,1,23-Jul-18,,This is one of my favorite moisturizers. I ve used it on and off for years  along with using the moisturizing serum from the same collection every day. It s light and absorbs quickly  it does leave a slight dewey look but not too much that it makes my combination type skin look oily.
5408,vonxojn,0,21-Jan-18,2 people found this helpful,This product had a light nice smell to it. Unfortunately  I did not feel like it moisturizer my face as I had expected.
5409,Carrie On,1,25-Jan-18,2 people found this helpful,IT WORKS AT ONCE. What they don’t say is that it cancels some redness  amooths wrinkles  AND hydrates. Decided to try it on wintry hands. Terrific!Main purpose. eye area  not to be neglected. Wish I dould bathe in it.
5410,Lauren Muglio,1,02-Feb-18,5 people found this helpful,I love this stuff so much. I am Irish and Italian and have insanely oily skin. To too it off  my skin looked dull and even more oily after I moved from the south to the north a few months ago. When it got colder out  I started to get fine lines on my forehead and nose from it being dry even though I was moisturizing. It seemed to only make my skin more oily. After two weeks of using this product  my skin looks supple  quenched and has a glow to it again. It has helped with oil control as well. This will continue to be a daily product for me! I highly recommend it
5411,Tanan,0,26-Feb-19,,The box the product was in was battered and ripped where you usually open it at the top- which means the product was opened. It also had a plastic wrapping around the box that shows it came in bulk with 2 other boxes and it just looked so unprofessional. The product itself works very well (yes I risked it buy still using it even though it obviously looked opened because I am too lazy to go through the return process) so I gave it one more star.
5412,Magz,1,31-Oct-18,,I was dealing with some strange breakouts on my face and I read another review to try this products after using an acne treatment since it was not greasy and is water-based. It helped keep my skin from drying out without interfering with acne treatment and fortunately now my acne is going away.
5413,Jaclyn,1,11-May-19,,I use this with the Neutrogena Hyrdo Boost Cleanser and I love the way it makes my skin feel after applying it! It s so hydrating but doesn t have that thick feeling that moisturizer has
5414,sammy D.,1,23-Apr-17,One person found this helpful,my irritable skin just soaks this up! and NO greasy look ever. I noticed after 2 weeks i looked so fresh and dewy and realized as my skin plumped up with moisture it softened out my little wrinkles! i look fresh and soft and less tired!
5415,Brooke Brehm,1,09-Jan-18,2 people found this helpful,I love that this doesn t feel like putting lotion on my face. I had refused to wear moisturizer daily before buying this last year because it made me feel like I was making my skin greasy or coating it  regardless of what I used. This is my one and only  now.
5416,Travis,0,04-Nov-18,2 people found this helpful,Disappointed. It made my skin matte and my skin was just red all the time. Don t recommend for sensitive or dry skin nor for men.
5417,Shelli,1,26-Aug-18,,I love this stuff. Applied at night  the next morning my skin looks so much better. I gave 4 stars because it makes me breakout. I now can only use under my eyes but I ll take it. This stuff is sooo hydrating
5418,Sara B.,1,21-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,Highly moisturizing and light weight. No irritation on my very sensitive skin. A little goes a long way  so the tub lasts a good while.
5419,Troy,1,17-Apr-19,,Great for moisturizing. Use very little as it does leave a film if you use too much. I get very dry skin in winter and started to notice wrinkles (I know  I’m vain though). Doesn’t have a strong odor and absorbs well.
5420,Anthony,1,28-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I m a guy and wanted to try a lighter  less oily face moisturizer. LOVE this product so far!
5421,ImagineIt,1,11-Feb-19,,This stuffs great! I put It on every morning before leaving for work! Makes my skin feel amazing . I was a bit worried because I’m a guy but I’ve been using it for around 2.5 weeks now and gonna keep using it .
5422,Marie,0,02-May-18,One person found this helpful,IMO not that moisturizing and if this is unscented I seriously cannot imagine how the scented version smells. I think it has an awful scent. Won t be repurchasing.
5423,Michael,1,31-May-19,,This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. I’ve tried to many different kinds that leave my face feeling oily or filmy. This is a wonderful moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth but feels light. A little goes a long way too.
5424,AA,1,27-Jul-17,2 people found this helpful,Goes on super smooth and absorbs quickly without leaving any residue. It also smells amazing  though fragrance free is always preferred.
5425,Flores,1,10-Mar-18,,This is a great anytime moisturizer. It has a good quality formula and didn t cause any irritation on my sensitive skin. I wish there was more product in the jar  it always feels like it runs out too fast. Definately feels like a hydro boost when my skin is dry af in the winter.
5426,Stevie,0,27-Mar-19,,My product is so watery if you turn it to the side it spills out! I will never buy again. Been using it for a week and my face looks the same. I basically feel like I am putting water with alcohol on my face. I m very disappointed.
5427,Niketa,1,01-May-19,,My daily moisturizer. My skin drinks this up. I like that my skin doesn t look thirsty with this. I rotate between this and Eve Naturals Niacin moisturizer for my acne.
5428,Mark,1,02-Jul-18,,This product works amazingly and makes my skin so soft and plump. I have acne prone skin and have had no problems with this product. It is quite expensive for the amount in the little hat and I find that Cerave daily moisturizer has similar ingrediants  a larger quantanty  and is much cheaper.
5429,Charlene T. Harper,0,12-May-19,,It s a fine product  and that s the problem. You want skin care products that enhance your skin  go above and love your face and body. This product doesn t do it for me  it s not excellent it s not horrible  it s just fine. It feels like a waste of time for me and this product if it doesn t do anything to my skin.
5430,Arielle,0,01-Aug-18,2 people found this helpful,COMPLETE GARBAGE. NO moisture at all  BURNED my skin in the corner of my mouth!
5431,Brittany Leigh,1,12-May-19,,My new favorite. Smells good  so moisturizing throughout the day and I use at night. Tried so many expensive ones and this one is waaaaay more affordable and inexpensive and way less costly!
5432,Amazon Customer,0,07-Mar-19,,No hydrating  plumping effects for me whatsoever. No lovely feeling of a moisture barrier left on the face as I was expecting. Waste of money. Like using nothing. Mystified at the good reviews.
5433,NyL,1,15-Nov-17,,I liked the gel-like texture  but this is kind of expensive for the small amount it as. Plus it is NOT organic or sulfate  paraben Free.  I would rather the Garnier skin active moisture rescue gel. That is the one I have been using for the las 4 years and for mixed skin is the one and only you gonna need.
5434,Mary Brown,1,27-Mar-19,,I have very dry skin that s starting to age (28yrs). I first ordered this in January and was VERY happy with the level of moisture it gave my skin in the middle of a Michigan winter. I ve since repurchased and will continue to use this for the foreseeable future. I also plan to look into other items in this line
5435,Amazon Customer,0,06-Jun-19,,The box came damaged  it looked like it was opened and put back together. There’s barely cream/gel in the container. Very disappointed. The product itself does nothing for my dried skin. I was hoping for better results.
5436,Jill MoM,1,12-Jun-17,2 people found this helpful,This stuff is heavenly. Feels so good on. I swear it helped my under eye dark circles immediately. I use it at night and in the morning before my makeup. Its super light and makes my skin feel great
5437,KatAK,0,21-May-18,One person found this helpful,My skin was suffering through the winter so I thought may end I should change my moisturizer. It’s never been drier than when I used this product. I have combinations skin.
5438,C-Nugget,1,19-Jul-17,2 people found this helpful,This smells so good! About half the time I use coco butter vaseline  which is really moisturizing but leaves my face too shiny for every day use. This is a nice alternative.
5439,Mardi,0,23-Feb-19,,Again ordered the eye cream and this product together - used faithfully for one month and did not see any difference in my skin. Back to using my cheap old Lubriderm and eye cream.
5440,J. West,0,17-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,Very strong fragrance. I was a bit disappointed with this product. Going to go back to Clinique moisture surge.
5441,sdwahine,1,28-Oct-18,,This is my new favorite moisturizer! I got it because I needed to find an oil free product after getting lash extensions  and wish I had found this sooner. It s amazing for my combination skin. Don t even need to use any under eye creams at night anymore.
5442,Amazon Customer,1,11-Nov-18,,I have oily skin and I’ve tried many different moisturizers from and none of them have really worked for me. I was a bit hesitant to buy this because it’s more expensive than any thing else I’ve used but it was definitely worth it! It’s instantly makes my skin feel softer and smoother while also giving me a nice glow! It’s also really lightweight and not greasy at all and is able to control my oils so i will definitely continue to buy this
5443,K. Kneisler,1,07-Dec-17,2 people found this helpful,My favorite moisturizer! I love how fresh  clean and smooth my skin feels when I use it. A+
5444,Byron Morales,0,20-Aug-18,2 people found this helpful,So much for hydrating  after a few mins my face would feel dry and the initial moisturizing feeling quickly disappeared
5445,V Spears,1,01-Oct-17,One person found this helpful,This stuff is truly amazing! I live for this every day. Face feels soft  very moist and hydrated. Just not enough for thirty dollars....lol okay  it is  a girl can dream.
5446,amy wenzel,0,17-Dec-18,3 people found this helpful,This moisturizer is really effective  but the heavy candy fragrance is gag inducing.
5447,Nadia the Annoyed,1,12-Aug-17,One person found this helpful,Love it! I have very sensitive and acne prone skin even as an adult. This moisturizer is the best thing I ve found in years! I ditched my overly pricey moisturizer over a year ago and haven t looked back.
5448,vero,1,23-Apr-19,,I have sensitive skin ... I break out and can be allergic to alot of things .. This moisturizer is refreshing and I have seen a difference in my skin .. I love it
5449,Kasey Hamilton,1,31-May-19,,Two words: Holy. Grail. I’ve been using this product for about 6 months and it is fabulous! I don’t like cream moisturizers because they feel too heavy on my skin  so I decided to try this gel blend. It is super lightweight and does not leave my skin feeling sticky at all. I’m fact  it makes my skin feel buttery soft! The HA in it adds a nice touch of brightening  as well. Highly recommend this if you’re looking for an everyday moisturizer!
5450,Yazmin Loaiza,1,21-Jul-18,,I have really oily skin. But  due to all the acne products I put on my face  it gets extremely dry. This is where the hydro boost comes in as a life saver. I use it every day like lotion before I head out of the house. Haven’t had any issues and it keeps my face looking nice. After daily use  I still have plenty and I purchased about two months ago. Worked great for me. But remember  everyone’s skin is different.
5451,Kindle Customer,1,21-Apr-18,,I love this product. It absorbs into skin without being greasy. Its also great as a primer before makeup. I accidentally bought the regular version and the perfume smell made me choke  but the extra-dry skin version is gloriously unscented!
5452,SBry,1,17-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,It s good for rosacea  at least it doesn t bother mine. I also use rose water with it
5453,Sigvard,0,15-May-18,One person found this helpful,Rather sticky texture  which does disappear after rubbing into skin  but doesn’t particularly moisturize.
5454,lesa l,1,29-Jun-19,,This is an excellent water gel. It instantly relieves tightness  lasts all day and adds a suppleness. A little goes a long way. Recommend.
5455,Nicole,1,09-Feb-18,,I was using a Neutrogena anti wrinkle moisturizer that was starting to create dry patches on my skin. I have oily skin so I wanted something that would be hydrating to the dry areas but not increase the oily or greasy look. I read reviews that this was good for oily skin so I ordered. With the VERY FIRST USE my dry patches were almost non existent. There was no oily feel to my skin and it smelled nice. It also had a slightly cooling effect. I only rated 4 stars bc I just started using the product. But I am very pleased !!
5456,Texas Liz,0,24-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,Lot of money for lot of packaging and not a lot of product. The little dab of product did not in fact act as a moisturizer  but did act as a water rinse with same drying effect.
5457,Valerie Brown,1,06-Dec-18,,Idk why everyone is saying it looks different then the original. I compared side by side and it looks and smells and feels exactly the same. Definitely buying from amazon again. Couple dollars cheaper
5458,AZ,1,25-Oct-18,,A small amount is adequate for moisturizing the entire face. I use it twice daily. It works even better than some much pricier products that I purchased in the past.  Will buy it again.
5459,dena,0,16-Jul-17,2 people found this helpful,Have been looking for a hydrating moisturizer. This one goes on SO smooth but did not help my dry skin once it dried.
5460,SYFARHAT,1,18-Jan-19,,Feels smooth and wet - helps to refresh dry skin . 4 stars as relative products such as one made by Bliss seems to have more lotion that water ( less viscous )
5461,Amazon Customer,0,18-Aug-18,2 people found this helpful,I like this item  I use it daily. I order it every month. Unfortunately the last time I ordered it  i received a fake item. It did not look  feel  or smell like the original.
5462,Heather,1,29-Apr-18,,this smells nice and feels nice going in. I have been using this for a few weeks on my very dry skin and have noticed a small difference. However  I use this first and put on moisturizer and sunblock on to help seal everything together
5463,pshelby,1,28-Aug-17,One person found this helpful,My skin feels so hydrated. Absolutely love this product. I use it with the cleanser and serum daily.
5464,Dana Hawkins,0,26-Feb-19,,This stuff makes my skinfeel greasy! Gross! It doesn t absorb like they say! I first used it because as I age my skin is changing. This stuff is just gross!
5465,Ashton,1,04-Feb-19,,I am really loving this moisturizer! it goes on thick  but dries almost instantly and soaks in great. Doesn t leave a greasy feel and makeup applies great over top.
5466,Samantha Ricca,0,12-Nov-18,One person found this helpful,I don t think it did any more than a normal lotion that doesn t cost as much.
5467,Maureen,1,06-Feb-19,,Nice feeling  smooth going on. Helps a bit with my eczema. I don t know if it does what the TV commercial represents it will... plumping up skin.
5468,Natsumi,1,31-May-19,,I haven’t use this product before. I have read it’s benefits so I decided to try. So far  I have no issues & I totally see myself buying another when I finish.
5469,Marinela,1,13-Jun-19,,Love my neutrogena hydro boost   like it name is this gel   gives you such a freshness in your face   specially now in summer time it’s a great product I love it
5470,eugenecmiller,1,22-Jan-19,,Just recieved it tried it twice feels good after a wash and shave . Feels light more watery than the previous one I bought. I compared it to the one in stores and it is authentic.
5471,RCL,1,23-Mar-19,,I really like how weightless and light this is. It moisturizes very well but feels fresh and not at all heavy or greasy.
5472,Jannettevill,1,16-Jun-19,One person found this helpful,Love!!! My skin is insanely dry and flakey despite me using a moisturizing facial wash  moisturizer  face masks etc. I use it beneath my sunscreen & I’ve noticed a huge improvement. Been using for 2-3 months now

5480,Bailee Lynn,1,07-Feb-19,,I don t like any moisturizers  but this one doesn t leave your skin feeling oily and it really seems to soak into your pores. Love  Love  Love.
5481,M. L. Powers,1,09-Oct-16,One person found this helpful,I don t think this was the right formula for my skin. There is nothing wrong with this moisturizer  however it stung a little on my dry skin. I think it would be great for oily/combination skin. I gave it 4 stars only because I don t like the way it smells.
5482,Hanna,1,26-Nov-18,,This product does an amazing job of keeping my skin hydrated but not oily. It also smells amazing!  My skin type: oily
5483,Amazon Customer,0,03-Jul-19,,The plastic packaging was ripped open ... and there was no safety seal on the creme.. do not trust putting this on my face
5484,Gottagetalife,1,03-Jul-19,,I m old  worn out and getting older by the second. However  this helps my face look more youthful! Yeah! :-)
5485,Nate Whiting,1,30-Jun-19,,I love this for daily use! It is light and goes on without residue  makes a great base for my powder foundation. I ve had zero issues with dry skin or acne.
5486,Patricia ONeill,0,02-Jun-19,,This product has a scent in it that I think irritated my face. After using it my face looked like it was burned.
5487,Elisabeth Running,1,02-Apr-18,,Really good if you don t like the feeling of creams on your face. Refreshing. I felt like I had to use more than recommended to be happy so I ended up purchasing the extra dry skin version. That one will last longer.
5488,Elissa Z.,1,03-May-19,,Great moisturizer  not heavy at all and absorbs quickly. Wonderful clean scent. I use with other Hydro Boost products.
5489,Kj,0,26-Jan-19,,I have very dry skin and this product didn t cut it. I read the reviews and everyone was raving about this so I figured I d give it a shot. Maybe the reviewers had different skin concerns?? I will be sticking to my heavy creams.
5490,M M,1,10-Jan-19,,I love the way the hydro boost makes my face feel good and it doesn’t itch like other face creams I’ve used. I’m definitely going to keep using it!
5491,Victoria Teixeira,1,19-Jul-18,,during the winter months some parts of my face get a bit dry and this does just the trick. I don t use it all the time because I don t want my skin to depend on this product  but I use a bit whenever during the day and it just melts into the skin. smells really good too!
5492,Shark bait777,1,06-Apr-17,One person found this helpful,Best moisturizer out there!! I have oily skin and this water gel based formula is great for my skin. I d say its a dupe for the clinique moisture surge.
5493,Shar B.,1,13-Jan-19,,So far so good with this product. I have very dry skin especially in the winter time and this does a good job hydrating my skin. Absorbs pretty fast.
5494,Shannon,1,12-Jul-17,2 people found this helpful,Leaves your face feeling cool and refreshed.
5495,Amazon Customer,1,28-Jun-18,,My favorite moisturizer! I have combination skin  leaning towards the more oily side. This does not cause breakouts at all! It makes my skin feel refreshed and dewy. In the summer I use this alone to moisturize  but in the winter I layer it under another oil free moisturizer.
5496,Taylor Nugent,1,04-Mar-19,,Not only does this keep my skin more moisturized than it’s ever been  but it definitely helps clear up breakouts/reduce pimple size literally overnight. I’ve used it twice a day every day for a couple weeks now and I honestly can barely tell I’ve used any by looking at the jar so I’m guessing it will last me at least a couple of months. And it smells AMAZING!!
5497,Jete  Adams,1,01-Mar-19,,I found this fairly decent. I m almost finished with my first container and while I don t see a drastic difference I am considering buying it again. I did like the way it felt  went on my face and how it hydrates my face. I have oily skin and did notice a decrease in oiliness in my T zone area  significantly.
5498,Samantha,1,18-Dec-18,,I have combination skin. Oily T Zone area at times. This moisturizer is amazing because it does not have the greasy feel that many do. The scent is fairly faint and fresh to me. I’ve tried many drug store and luxury brand moisturizers and this is my favorite.
5499,Autumn Laraway,1,31-Dec-16,One person found this helpful,I have oily skin and this seemed to be helping during the winter  but using it daily caused chapping. So  I use it sparingly now.
5500,JD2,1,22-Dec-18,,Great moisturizer. Feels good and hydrating when you put it on. It’s one of the few moisturizers I’ve found that works well under makeup.
5501,Carissa S.,1,25-Apr-19,,For someone with sensitive skin this is super helpful to moisturize without later drying my skin more. Better than most ones I have used and I don t use much of it.
5502,Amazon Customer,0,15-Mar-18,2 people found this helpful,The jar mine came in was all broken and looked like it had been used :( this product is good but I was very d with how I received it.
5503,Rose,0,09-May-18,2 people found this helpful,This product is a waste of money  it does not work.
5504,Samantha,1,22-Apr-19,,Honestly really like this product  I have oily skin so this product is good for people who have oily skin.
5505,Clay,0,28-May-19,,This product does nothing -- should have noted that the first ingredient is water which.......evaporates. I ve used it for a couple of weeks with and find that it does nothing - not even offering a good base for my makeup. Will return to something richer.
5506,Cristina D.,1,09-Nov-18,,I use this product after cleansing my face and I love the light weight feel. It doesn t make my skin feel oily  dry or heavy. I also am able to use it under makeup. No problems yet with this product. 3 jar so far.
5507,myshkamysh,1,27-Jan-18,5 people found this helpful,I LOVE this stuff. It s not greasy at all  but I can see and feel the difference the next day especially when I put it on at night. I will be sticking with this as one of my primary moisturizers going forward. Their entire hydro boost line is great  I highly recommend it after going through countless moisturizers I haven t seen many results with.
5508,Chloe,1,18-Jan-18,,Neutrogena hydro boost is so lightweight and refreshing! My skin has been so soft and hydrated since I started using this. I would definitely recommend it!
5509,Dan Romano,1,15-Jun-16,2 people found this helpful,This is probably the best face moisturizer I have ever used. It leaves your skin feeling SO SO SO nice. Love this stuff. Will DEFINITELY be buying again. Recommend highly  try this!!!
5510,Danith Sath,0,13-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,This product doesn t really hydrate your skin. It gives it the appearance like its hydrating for only a few hours. If you apply it at night and leave it on the next day - it actually dries your skin out. Maybe because of all of the added harsh ingredients.
5511,Kristina Gardner,1,05-Dec-18,,This is a dupe for belif aquabomb moisturizer. I love this! I recommend giving it a try! Aquabomb is a bit thicker but overall the are extremely similar.
5512,lori robbins,1,01-May-19,,It absorbs very nicely and quick and can be worn under make up and be soft and smooth.
5513,shopper1A,1,10-Jun-18,,This moisturizing cream is very nice  not greasy! it feel s really good  I use it both day and night. It works much like a higher priced brand I was using.
5514,Katherine Acosta,1,18-Mar-18,,Love it I do have sensitive skin and sooo dry and used it every day morning night afternoon whatever on damped face and feels so cool never got any problem  so sad some other girls do but for me it’s great I’ll be ordering my 4th soon
5515,Alex Ama,1,29-Oct-17,,I have oily skin and was looking for a gel moisturizer that would dry and absorb into the skin without leaving a shiny finish like the Neutrogena oil-free moisturizer. This moisturizer does the trick and smells amazing.
5516,Kylie Whit,1,17-Nov-18,,Improved how my skin looks. Did not get rid of my wrinkle. Has a nice  subtle fragrance that I enjoyed. I would have given five stars but the price is a bit high for a tiny amount of lotion.
5517,Puskar Dev,1,25-Jan-19,,Works great. Best moisturizer lotion I’ve ever had. I apply it twice a day  once in the morning and once in the night. So far I’m amazed by this product.
5518,Melissa F.,1,16-Apr-19,,I have very sensitive skin and finding a moisturizer has been difficult. It is very light weight  no greasy residue. So far no breakouts.
5519,Amazon Customer,1,24-May-19,,My grandma is 79 and looks like she s 60! Everyone compliments her glowing  tight  firm skin and she credits this product every time. She s been using it for years now and absolutely loves it. I m 24 and will start using this now because of her :) i have to continue these great genes :)
5520,Linh,1,02-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,I use it once a day before bedtime and after 2 days of using I noticed some improvement on my open-pores and the softness of my skin. Howewer I find the smell a little heavy as if it has fragrance. Will keep using for a longer time.
5521,Trisha,0,10-Apr-18,,The hydro boost broke my skin out with tiny white head pimples and I never get pimples. It also dried the skin out around my nose and peeled. Super disappointed.
5522,Annie Mattsen,1,07-Feb-18,,Love this as my main moisturizer! Also love to use it as a primer before makeup. Lightweight and a little goes a long way! Oil free makes it a great product for those with oily or acne prone skin!
5523,Ale,0,03-Mar-19,,After finishing my Gokujun premium hyaluronic solution  I decided to give this humectant a try and instantly regretted it. Not only is it 5x more expensive  it is not moisturizing  it has a strong irritating fragrance and caused a massive breakout. Won t be finishing this product and definitely not purchasing again.
5524,Bee,1,04-Dec-18,,I like this moisturizer a lot but now in the winter time I need something heavier. This is great for summer.
5525,Warren Pinto,1,24-May-19,,I’ve been suffering from dry skin lately and this is definitely helping.
5526,Alannah,1,17-Apr-19,,I enjoy the fact that I spent a little more money than I ever have on skin products  and got such an amazing results! It seems like a tiny bottle for the price but it goes SO far  as you don t need much each use! My skin is very dry  and since using this product I ve noticed my face is much softer and more moisturized!
5527,Holly Hill,1,23-Nov-18,,I have oily  acne prone skin and I am sensitive to a lot of products but this moisturizer works wonderfully for me.
5528,Suzanne J. Bertolino,1,30-Mar-18,,I m 47-years old ginger. I am addicted to this product and will never use anything else for moisture! Certainly gives my face a boost!
5529,c a drys,0,28-Jun-19,,Did not moisturize my face just stayed on the surface of my skin. Had an unusual smell to it. No matter how small an amount I put on my face it just felt like it needed to be washed off. Very unpleasant.
5530,Theresa,0,14-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,This item came also in my order no cap and 1/2 jar gone !!! Never in my life all 3 items came damaged and filthy dirty looks like pulled from a dumpster rather than retail shelf
5531,tabitha,1,11-Nov-18,,Doesn t leave that oily feeling afterward and a little goes a long way. No overwhelming fragrance no crazy minerals or anything just basic good moisturizer. It works well.
5532,JOSEPHINE MATA,1,29-Jul-18,,I love it. My skin feels so much better. I love that it is not greasy and my skin absorbs it very quickly.
5533,Pamela M.,0,20-May-19,,I really like your product but not your container. You need to change your container to be recyclable and animal testing free. If you do this and let people know  you will have more clients.
5534,Silvia,0,24-Jun-19,,The product initially improved my skin. My skin was dry  flaky  and red. After a couple of weeks using it  it no longer took care of the redness and the skin was back to its flakiness . Definitely disappointing!
5535,summer,1,27-Nov-18,,I love how this plumps up the ridges on my face that I get from my CPAP mask every morning. Now  I don t feel self-conscious when I walk out the door.
5536,DianaJoy,1,27-Oct-17,One person found this helpful,Been paying around $19.99 in various drug stores. So this deal is great! Love this gel!! It leaves my face so soft and smooth. Ultra hydrating but doesn’t leave my T-zone skin oily looking at all.
5537,Linda,1,02-Jul-19,,This is a great moisturizer it leaves your skin feeling so solved
5538,Maria,1,08-Jan-19,,It s good overall. But seems like it s just creating a coat on the skin and washing of the next morning
5539,Salliec,1,17-Mar-18,,Seems to moisten all day after applying once in the am. It s the only moisturizer I use on my face.
5540,CL-Stylist,1,16-Mar-19,,I have very picky skin that breaks out easily or looks oily. I don’t have those problem at all with this! The best moisturizer under makeup I’ve ever found. I bought the one with sunscreen for days I’m outside
5541,Melanie,1,29-Jan-19,,This moisturizer is wonderful! I use it every night before going to bed and wake up with great skin. I struggle with acne and this moisturizer doesn’t make me break out like other moisturizers do. I highly recommend!
5542,Wanda Henderson,1,19-Apr-18,,Great product for light weight moisturizing. It has no coconut oil in it. I m allergic. This is also about 1/2 the price I would normally pay every where else.
5543,Sara P,1,07-Dec-18,,I really like this moisturizer. It is light but moisturizes my face well to the point where if I don t use it  my face breaks out from dehydration. No scent  absorbs quickly  feels nice and cools my skin a little. I use it at night and I use the one with SPF during the day.
5544,rguymer,1,20-May-19,,I don’t usually mind scents  but this product is a little too perfume-y for me. Overall  it’s a great moisturizer. When I wash and pat dry my face  My skin tends to be on the drier side. Applying this moisturizer  I can instantly feel my skin soaking it in like a sponge. It’s thin  light  and not greasy.
5545,Dandvic,0,21-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,Though it helps with moisture  it also caused my face to break out terribly. May be my skin is more sensitive. Clinique surge was better for me.
5546,Amazon Customer,1,24-Apr-19,,Pretty scentless which is great. I had super dry skin on my face  probably from using cheap makeup but now I hydrate every night and it’s helped immensely.
5547,Brandon C.,1,16-Jun-19,,Great moisturizer. Gets expensive though when you re using it everyday and it l run out before too long.

5551,Mary Osgood,1,21-Sep-18,,This is the best face lotion! I ve used expensive products from the department store to Walmart products and this is by far my favorite. It moisturizes my face without making it oily or greasy and it great to use before putting on makeup. I highly recommend this moisturizer!

I have combo oily skin that is sensitive - I was worried this would break me out  but over past month no extra breakouts  my tinted moisturizer goes on smoother and it has faded some of the hyperpigmentation on my skin- I d call that a win! Will buy again
5561,Anna Lee,1,20-Nov-18,,I love this moisturizer it feels so nice on your skin but it’s very little product for the prize
5562,BN,0,30-Jun-19,,I was excited for this product. But after around a week of using it i noticed dry skin appearing in the places i was applying it. I gave it another week. Still. Stopped using and within a few days dryness and peeling skin was gone. Waste of mondy and now i have a mostly full product sititng on my shelf.

5625,Jules,1,11-Sep-17,4 people found this helpful,Received a small sample size with a hand cream and ended up loving so much  I bought the full size. For all the people out there with dry skin  this alone will not cut it. I originally thought this was a serum and used it as a base for my moisturizer  and continue to use it as such. Very inexpensive alternative to a lot of serums on the market  and it s very effective at helping keep moisture in the skin. I m sure this is a great light moisturizer for people with dry skin. It also smells amazing!!
5626,CRYSTAL,1,01-Jul-16,One person found this helpful,This is perfect for those that have combination skin. It Hydrates the dry spots perfectly but its so light weight that it doesn t make your face more oily. I normally use this in the mornings before make up application.
5627,Emily Wellman,1,23-Dec-18,,I have combination skin (more oily than dry though) and this is the only moisturizer that I have found that leaves my skin feeling moisturized  but not greasy. The extra dry version is great as well. It s definitely worth a try; it s done wonders for my skin!

5633,Amazon Customer,1,30-Aug-18,,Absorbs quickly and has a clean scent. Will give an updated review after a months use. The last couple days though my skin has stayed hydrated throughout the day when lately I have been having dry patches around my chin/mouth.
5634,KT,1,26-Feb-19,,This product is light  has a nice fragrance  and feels refreshing as it’s applied. However  I have dry skin (not at all oily)  and this was not enough to improve the dryness.
5635,kelly vazquez,1,16-Jan-19,,This product is amazing. I have tried so many other moisturizers and this is the one that works best with my oily skin. Gives a matte finish  leaves my skin so soft  and evens out my tone. A little goes a long way.
5636,K G.,1,09-Jul-18,,Awesome product and less expensive than at the drugstore.
5637,Jessica,1,04-Jun-16,2 people found this helpful,I have used the gel formula and the gel-cream formula  and I love both. I have very sensitive  oily skin  but as I approach my forties I find I need to moisturize every night. In the cooler months  the gel-cream is perfect. It soaks in quickly yet provides a nice amount of moisture. I do occasionally need to supplement it with my Eucerin redness relief night cream  as I live in an area where winter hits hard and time is either spent indoors  with the heat on  or outside  with the bitter cold/wind/ice/snow attacking my fragile skin  but most of the time  the gel-cream is enough. In warmer months  the gel formula is a godsend. My face sweats very easily  leading me to wash my face a lot which then dries my skin so I need to apply lotion  and then I sweat more (it s quite the vicious cycle). This is literally the first facial moisturizer I have EVER found that doesn t irritate my skin or make me sweat when it s warmer than 74 degrees. It moisturizes enough to keep my skin baby soft and supple  without leaving any film or greasy appearance. I haven t noticed any decrease in wrinkles  but I don t have many and I didn t purchase this to treat the few wrinkles I do have so I m not deducting any stars for that. I love these moisturizers!!
5638,Cecily M.,1,31-Oct-18,One person found this helpful,I have super oily acne prone skin and this mosterizer not only keeps acne away but it made my skin soft and so touchable( but I don’t touch it cause that causes acne lol) I recommend this to everyone!

5641,Sofia,1,22-Apr-19,,The gel turned out to be fantastic! It does hydrates well  even though my skin tends to be super dry after winter heating season. The gel is very light and it is not sticky or greasy. The scent is super light and waterish. When it is dry it has a matt texture so you can easely apply make up over it.

5701,L. L.,1,23-Nov-17,10 people found this helpful,I have combination oily skin that is prone to acne  so finding a good moisturizer is often a pain yet very critical. This stuff is amazing! I had been using Cliniques gel moisturizer for a long time  but so far  I now prefer Neutrogena s over Cliniques. It moisturizers yet absorbs into the skin so isn t heavy or greasy. I ve noticed my skin becoming more supple and I haven t had any issues with it clogging pores. I am sensitive to scents  and i do not find the scent overpowering. It is just light and fresh. I do recommend this product.
5702,D,0,11-Mar-18,2 people found this helpful,UPDATE: It really is expensive and useless. Any patches of dry skin  it doesn t matter how often I use this (several times a day)  those rough patches don t improve. Anything that isn t lizard skin dry ends up SEVERELY breaking out in acne from this. Seriously  the only good thing is that it doesn t leave residue.  BAD: Packing was a hassle! (it was boxed into the packaging and I had to rip it apart to get to the bottle.)  BAD: Pretty bottle  but there s lots of lost room for more cream.  GOOD: It absorbs cleanly and doesn t leave any residue (like other moisturizers I ve used.)  BAD: If your skin isn t super starving  dry and cracking  anywhere else  this cream will cause whiteheads over a day or two.
5703,Ricardo,1,03-Aug-18,,Love the moisturizing effect. I use after shaving. Not oily and makes my skin feel and look great. Been using 6 months now. Highly recommend.

5753,Mary,1,05-Jun-17,4 people found this helpful,I have really oily skin  so I m always very skeptical of a lot of moisturizers. Even a lot of oil-free ones still leave me feeling greasy. Also  to be honest I ve had not so great experiences with neutrogena products before.  The Hydro Boost Water Gel worked perfectly for me though! It feels so nice on my skin and leaves it feeling soft without leaving any greasy residue. The amount doesn t seem like a lot  but honestly you only need a very tiny bit of the gel for it to spread across your whole face.  I think this moisturizer would work good for any skin types  but is particularly great for oily-skin types.
5754,santiago,1,27-Jun-19,,No chance of breakouts. Soothing to even sunburnt or damaged skin. And ontop of that all it seems to be sufficient mosturizing. I just wish they removed the fragrence as it lessens the soothing affect.

This product is perfect - it dries quickly and non oily so I can wear it by itself or under my makeup. It made my skin softer and brighter. New face products always make me break out the first couple of days  but this was gentle on my skin and I only saw positives!

5823,Jheneya,1,31-May-17,One person found this helpful,I absolutely love this hydro boost water gel. It really refreshes  cools  and hydrates my skin. The gel glides on easily and absorbs into my skin leaving it soft  but it also firms at the same time. It has a nice fresh scent and it comes in a generous size tub  which should last a couple of months.  It has hylauronic acid  which is a natural carbohydrate found in the human body  which hydrates the skin. Babies are born with high amounts of hylauronic acid  which is why their skin is so soft and supple  and it starts to decrease as we age. Being in my late 30 s  incorporating hylauronic acid into my skin regimen is a must so I love that this gel has it.  I use this morning and night. At night  it s the last thing I apply on my skin before going to sleep. In the morning  I apply it after washing my face and then I apply a separate sun-screen over it. The gel is oil-free so it doesn t cause breakouts. I wish I found this sooner.

5927,exousia336,1,08-Dec-16,One person found this helpful,This was recommended to me by my Curology advisor. I have icthyosis and lately my skin has been super oily (likely as a result of getting off antidepressants and other hormone-wrecking medications over the last year). I ve been battling to adjust as much in my routine as possible and still be able to fight off acne  which I can only do a certain degree if it s hormonal  and to manage my horribly dry skin.  I ve finally found a balance that seems to work pretty well as my internal workings even out and this moisturizer has been a good part of that! While using products that do exfoliate and treat my newfound breakouts  this does a good job of not contributing to the clogged pore mess that I can get myself into while still leaving my skin feeling moisturized.  Before I used this product I was using a much more expensive MAC product that I loved  but it just wasn t economical. This has been a nice replacement (though I still miss that pricier product overall).

5960,Amazon Customer,0,16-Nov-17,2 people found this helpful,The shipping box was fine but the actual product box was dented and torn and looked like it was very old. There’s no expiration date that I can find anywhere on the box or jar. The jar was opened and had no sort of safety seal or anything to indicate that it was a new  unused product. As I have no idea how many people stuck their nasty fingers in this I’m going to return it. Doesn’t seem sanitary and even though this product has great reviews I’m not risking it.
5961,June Minard,1,04-Jun-15,3 people found this helpful,What can i say? This stuff is just awesome! I have very dry skin..im starting to get deep wrinkles at the age of 38. I have used creams  lotions  coconut oil etc but they all make me feel and look greasy. This moisturizer soaks in like pure water leaving no greasy residue. It gives me that dewy look of youth and is great even under makeup because its not heavy or oily. I love the texture of my skin  kind of like baby skin..new and fresh feeling..soft..velvety. I am also impressed with how long it lasts. A little goes a long way. If you re looking for a deep moisture gel that feels weightless yet lasts all day this is the gel for you.

I was worried when I saw how small the container was  but I quickly found that a little bit goes a long way. When I put this water gel on  it tingles and feels extremely refreshing. It s unscented and leaves no residue whatsoever. My skin tends to get oily during the day  but I notice I m much less greasy with this moisturizer than when I use other brands. I also use the Hydro Boost eye gel. Definitely recommend.

6036,Lasya,0,11-Dec-17,2 people found this helpful,I wanted to like this but ended up hating it. I ve used Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture  Combination Skin since forever and love it. I wanted to try something with a bit more hydration since the the Oil-Free Moisture isn t enough for winter. The Hydro boost makes my face burn like it s on fire everytime. I kept hoping it is temporary and will get better as my skin gets used to it. But after a week of use  it only kept getting worse and did the exact opposite of hydrating. My skin has become dry  flaky and blotchy. I ve never had such an experience with a moisturizer before. I should ve listened to the other reviews warning of skin burns. Such a waste of money. I want a refund! : ( I m going back to my original moisturizer.

6040,Amazon Customer,1,17-Mar-17,7 people found this helpful,What is the most frustrating skin type? Oh I know! I know! It s the combination skin type-only the cruelest kind of skin anybody can have. I have been cursed with the said skin type-parts of the skin on my face were oily and shiny like no other star and the other parts of my face always looked like they re in the middle of a drought! It s always been quite a challenge to find the right product to suit my needs and every time I thought that I had found the right one  I had to always put it back in the rack because it was so darn expensive!  But this Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel right here is the Holy Grail! I was looking for something that felt light  moisturized the dry bits on my face and kept the other bits from getting more oily. This product is exactly that! It gave enough moisture  did not make my face more oily and felt light! It almost felt like it wasn t even there! And a little bit of the product goes a long way  which is like a bonus! It also has this lovely  very faint  calming scent to it  which makes the experience all the more richer. Because it is water based  it gets absorbed into the skin pretty easily and is also pretty cool to touch. It feels very nice to apply this onto your face just after you ve had a hot water shower. My skin stays soft and moisturized all through the day and all this for such a low price?!!! You gotta be kidding me! And because it is so light and efficient  I think it would work beautifully for every skin type.  I would definitely buy this again and recommend this product to people with almost every other skin type out there

6059,Replicant,1,23-Jan-17,5 people found this helpful,If anyone out there is confused about the fact that there are two nearly identical products: a) Hydro Boost WATER GEL and b) Hydro Boost GEL-CREAM  let me help. The Water Gel is for regular to oily skin  and looks like a slightly milky blue gel. The Gel-Cream is for extra-dry skin  and looks like a white opaque cream. The packaging can be easily confused  and the names are so similar...  I have oily  acne-prone skin  so I generally hate all moisturizers  especially anything that can potentially cause buildup and block my pores. But the water gel is a different story. It s very light  non-greasy  and it truly absorbs rapidly  even for me  with my oily skin. If you are extremely dry  this might not be enough moisture for you  but for regular to oily skin  it s pretty great  and leaves the surface of your skin feeling comfortable and soft  not clammy and shiny. I have applied silicone primers and face foundation right over this water gel  with zero problems  and my primer (Smashbox) did not pill up.  There *is* a scent  but it s very fresh and mild  and the fragrance disappears immediately on your skin. The blue color is not noticeable once it s applied. If anyone cares  the jar is a lot more upscale than Neutrogena packaging usually is. It s the kind of jar you wouldn t mind leaving out on the counter  although it s a little heavy  so it s not going to travel well if you re going on a trip.  The nice thing about this water gel is that it works equally well all over your face  including eyes and lips. I like to let it sink into my lips  then apply a waxy barrier lip balm over the top (like Burts Bees or Chapstick) to seal the moisture in.  I m happy with this product  and I can see myself repurchasing this when I m done with this jar. I m not sure why it s so pricey  though. It does seem fairly excessive for a drugstore-level product.

It wasn t something on the surface that I could scratch  but felt like it was deeper in the face. I don t know how much hyaluronic acid is actually in this  but it didn t seem to moisturize very well. The texture is very smooth and light  but as the day goes on it just feels like there s a layer of silicone sitting on top of the skin.

6098,Chelz,1,21-Mar-17,4 people found this helpful,I have acne prone skin so I use a lot of products to control my acne and many of those products are super drying to my skin. I also have eczema on my face so my skin is naturally dry and flaky at those areas. Also  because I have sensitive skin I use a powder/mineral foundation so keeping my face moisturized is essential for my makeup application or else I ll have very dry flaky areas which is embarrassing. I cannot use many moisturizers out there on the market because I have a sensitivity to most oils  waxes  and plants  so finding a moisturizer that kept my dry skin hydrated and not irritated was a hard thing to do. I tried a lot of different moisturizers from Olay  Aveeno  Proactiv  and Porespective but none of them were hydrating enough or they caused some sort of irritation. I also tried DML which did an okay job at moisturizing but caused minor breakouts here and there and also did not hydrate me well enough to where I could apply my mineral makeup with no issues. So I decided to try the hydro-boost since it has so many great reviews and seemed free of stuff that would irritate my skin. And so far it has done wonderfully. I have been using it every day and my skin have never been so hydrated in my life. It is lightweight and absorbs into my skin very fast. I am able to apply my makeup with no dry patches! My skin stays hydrated all day long and my makeup stays in place. This stuff has been a God send for me!

6106,AmK,1,17-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,Since it s winter  my skin has gotten drier so I ve been looking for a moisturizer to hydrate my skin. I bought this because I heard good reviews and has a good price for a moisturizer. After using it for two weeks  I will say that the moisturizer works well when you layer it with another hydrating step to your routine  especially if you have dry skin. Because if you use this alone  moisturizing once probably won t be enough. It has no fragrance and it comes in a pretty blue tub. I would recommend using this for summer/spring season.

After two weeks of using it my face started to feel smoother and glowing even applying it only once a day. The only thing is  that my face used to be so dry after wash that I had to apply this moisturizer twice with 5 minute difference for the best results. But now my face feels better and better every day that I don t have to spply it twice any more. I used to by face creams and moisturizers for $50 and over and some of them don t get even close of making my face hydrated and not greasy. I don t know the secret  but I will keep using it. P.S: it smells amazing!!!!!

Once done  my hair is extremely soft and light. This gel doesn t weight down my hair and my hair is freeze free all day long --- My hair has never looked better.

6121,Michelle Mac,0,04-Jan-18,,Smells good but might be too fragrant for some. Way too watered down. Reminds me more of a gel than a lotion or cream but it’s not that hydrating.

At first  I was impressed with the packaging and the color was very pretty  but when I opened the box  I saw that the part of the jar that holds the cream was only about 3/4  high. There s only about 3 tablespoon of product in the jar. Granted  it does say that it contains 1.7 fl oz in the title but I didn t connect it with such a small amount.  The jar was not sealed nor was it filled to the brim so I m wondering if it was used by someone  returned  and then sent to me.  Then I decided to use it to see if the claims are true.  1. I don t have sensitive skin so I found that it burns only a tiny bit but I expected a small amount of burning because it contains acid. The burning lasted for about an hour.  2. I wet my cheeks with water just a bit and then dipped my index finger into the cream. The amount that clung to my finger was enough to spread the small amount around my entire face. I patted it in and waited and waited to see if my face looked well hydrated. Nope. Not even a bit more than before I applied it. I get the same results using a cheap face cream.  I already have a very good facial cleansing routine that includes a scrub  facial soap and cream that leaves my face looking good and feeling hydrated and all these products combined costs much less. I just had to try this product but I won t buy it again.
6124,Phuong Le,1,18-May-16,,I have been using this product for a few months as a night cream. For the first impression  it absorbs quite quickly and makes my face feel great. When I wash my face in the morning  I can still feel the texture of the cream on my skin when I rub my face with wet hands. However  the product was not what I expected  my skin feels a little tight.
6125,Ellery W.,0,28-Jan-17,10 people found this helpful,Initially I was amazed by this gel moisturizer. It went on my skin nicely and made my face so smooth ans silky. It felt so lightweight like nothing was on my skin. I really loved the texture of the gel. Unfortunately  the smell is too potent and intense for me. It smelled like I was rubbing perfume on my face. Then after three uses  the worst thing happened. I developed quite a few small red bumps on my cheek  along the jaw line  and under my mouth. They were not pimples but rather allergic reactions. Neutrogena added dyes and too much fragrance in the formula. It still bewilders me they even call this suitable for sensitive skins... Acne-prone AND sensitive skin is a congenital curse. I guess I am on the hunt for a new moisturizer again.
6126,Geraldine B. Martorano,1,19-Mar-15,,Very pleased with the way my skin feels after applying the gel. I have only been using it for a couple weeks so  of course  there is nothing dramatic and being a realistic senior I am not expecting miracles.

6134,Klerique,1,01-Oct-16,,Want your face to feel silky soft? Hate using a face cream that clogs your pores and feels thick on your face? Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gellar is just the ticket. It goes on smoothly  doesn t make my skin feel oily or leave a oily sheen and immediately makes tight skin feel refreshed and supple. My only issue is it s cost  but I will gladly pay it to have beautiful younger looking skin!

6144,Literary Gemini,1,28-May-17,One person found this helpful,I brought this because my skin started peeling really but and it was dry and rough. It felt like snake skin to me. I ve been using the cleaner and makeup remover wipes so I wanted to add this to my routine. The texture is a creamy gel. You only need a little  too much and you ll end up wiping it off.  It took about a week for my skin to get back to normal. It still gets dry after washing  but a small dab of this and it s perfectly smooth. It has a light clean airy scent. I m picky about my skin products because my skin reacts to nearly anything on it  but this stuff is amazing. I m using all the Neutrogena hydro line because it s the best so far for my skin.

SECOND PURCHASE...I bought  the brand name +shape of the jar....UH OH!  Thought there was only one formulation--NOT SO! I have EXTRA DRY SKIN...First purchase from a brick+mortar store had EXTRA DRY SKIN on a tiny white label...front and center. It was great.  The Prime purchase didn t have the label. It contained... alcohol and a light fragrance  .... can t use it...had opened the jar   so unable to return it.  Lesson LEARNED. Check label before buying.

6156,corso,1,22-Jun-16,13 people found this helpful,I had some doubts that this product wouldn t sit well with my skin. But it is so moisturizing without making your face all oily! After a few days of usage  I cannot believe my skin is actually so smooth and not dry -- it feels normal! I hardly have any dry patches anymore. I just wish it wasn t so pricey for a small amount  which is why I m giving it 4 stars. I also enjoy the smell and I like how it s a gel rather than a cream  making it easier to apply and for my skin to absorb. There is no protective seal  so don t let that throw you off into thinking that your product was used and also be careful when you open it initially so that you don t have gel flying everywhere.  Overall  I think it s a great product for people who suffer from dry skin and combination skin. I consider myself as a combination skin  but more dry than oily. I look forward to the long term results!  UPDATE: (12/2016) I repurchased my second product a month ago! I still enjoy the product  and it still moisturizes my skin well! I want to use it more excessively  but I tend to be conservative with the usage since it s pretty pricey and there s a little bit of gel in the container. Wish it could be cheaper and contain more gel in these products!

6164,Tony,1,09-Jul-15,7 people found this helpful,I saw the commercial for this and decided to give it a shot. My skin tends to be dry which causes peeling/flaking. Which is dumb because the rest of my face is oily.There s nothing worse than having oily skin with dry spots. I ve tried everything from coconut oil to various lotions. I used this hydro boost gel and after the first use I was stunned.  It absorbs really fast since it s water based. It hydrates really well  but since it s oil free your face stays clean. No shine! It tingles a bit and leaves your face feeling so fresh and clean. It literally makes your skin look beautiful. To other people it may just be just be another moisturizer but to me this is a life changer. To finally have the confidence to take a closeup selfie is amazing.
6165,Amazon Customer,1,15-Dec-17,,I’m not someone who shops at Sephora ? it’s not practical for my income  so I’m a minimalist and typically cheap when it comes to self-care and beauty products. This is worth a personal splurge of 20+ dollars if you want refreshed skin.

6181,Jessie Cody,1,19-Mar-15,33 people found this helpful,This Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel is said to instantly quench skin and keep it looking smooth  supple and hydrated day after day.  It is Oil-Free  Non-comedogenic  Just apply evenly to face and neck after cleaning  Comes in a big 1.7 oz (48g) container  ******************************************************  Now  Anyone who has been to my blog before knows that I normally would like to go for more natural products. They tend to break my sensitive skin out less and cause less irritation altogether. This being my first time being chosen to review an item from Influenster I was super excited because I found out that it was a Hyaluronic Acid product and you all know how much I love those!  I was so excited that I actually did the unboxing and thought I was filming and then come to find out I wasn t and had to redo it. Here is my unboxing video.  I did try this product for a few weeks and didn t have any breakouts with it. It is a really watery gel. I m not sure I like the container  I much rather have a pump style container because I don t like germs especially when applying something on your face and around your eyes. I just made sure I washed my hands before dabbing around inside there.  I love the smell even though it was really hard for me to describe. It smells really watery and fresh. VERY pleasant for sure.  This product absorbs super fast and leaves your face really soft and supple. I fount when using this product before applying makeup it would help the makeup with coverage and smooth out the surface for better coverage.  Overall I really liked this product  Though I would probably still stick with my more natural approach I have going on with the current products I use  I would definitely recommend it to others. It does exactly what it says it will do on the label.  I hope you found this review to be useful.  I did receive this product free in a VOXBOX to share my honest opinion about it. @Neutrogena @Influenster #BehindTheGlow

6186,Lin,0,30-Sep-18,13 people found this helpful,This is NOT Neutrogena HydroBoost. It is blue colored  a thin gel  and has a perfume smell. The REAL Neutrogena Hydroboost is a thick gel  white  and is fragrance- free  as is advertised for them. The packaging is the same  but the inside product is ABSOLUTELY NOT the real thing. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM IF YOU WANT THE REAL NEUTROGENA HYDROBOOST.
6187,Lady LuLu,1,18-Jul-17,2 people found this helpful,I purchased the whole lot of the product line  the Hydro Boost Facial Cleansing Gel  the Hydrating Serum  the Eye Gel Cream and the Hydro Boost Water Gel. The results were immediate and ever improving! This has replaced my moisturizers but I still apply a light retinol cream on top of this at night time. I am in my late 20 s and on a journey to care for my skin and prevent wrinkles. When I seen the popularity of this line I decided to give this whole line a true twice a day month long trial. I exfoliate first with the Hydro Boost face cleanser  pat dry and apply the serum first  the eye gel  and then the water gel  face and neck. The results are absolutely amazing! My skin is perfectly clear  blemish free and it glows  and I mean it really glows! I can honestly say that I have noticed a true difference with this product line than any other products thus far  and I mean expensive brands. I can highly notice and feel the intense moisturizing this product delivers. The directions do not state how much of the product to use in a single use  but I use very minimal amounts and it seems to work just fine. The results I got in a week from this product line was better than the results I got using Olay Regenerist daily moisturizer and retinol night creams for months! My skin looks like it did when I was 18! Now  I hardly wear makeup anymore because of how healthy and vibrant my face is! My skin tone is even and glows  under my eyes are no longer dark and saggy  and no blemishes or break outs since using the products and no wrinkles as of yet. But if I do wear makeup  it works perfectly underneath light mineral foundation and a touch of bronzer! The cleansing gel is perfect at removing makeup; I even use it to clean my exfoliation pads and makeup applicators! I only wish there was a body lotion and body wash that accompanied this line  as I have used the water gel to moisturize my hands  feet and pregnant belly  and it immediately softens skin! You will surely fall in love with this product and I highly recommend it to everyone!
6188,Sakoulas_86,1,13-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,I ve never written an Amazon review before but this product is worth taking the time to review. I have sensitive combination acne-prone skin (so basically I have hated my skin since I was 13 and have struggled my whole life to find the right combination of products). For a long time I made the mistake of not moisturizing my skin  thinking that super drying  harsh products were the only way to combat my acne.  Once I discovered that moisturizing actually kept my skin from overproducing oil  my skin has been much happier  but it was still a struggle to find a moisturizer that wouldn t cause breakouts.  This is hands-down the best one I ve tried. I was skeptical about it at first  suspecting that this whole hyaluronic acid thing was just a trend / marketing ploy. But some of the best products for my skin have been Neutrogena (the acne control lotion in their acne skincare set is literally the ONLY thing that ever helped clear up my acne after close to twenty years of trying every product out there  including Proactive and three different Arbonne lines). So I trust Neutrogena and after reading all the rave reviews decided to give this a shot.  It is GREAT stuff. Like many others have noted  it absorbs instantly into your skin and then you can t tell you have ANYTHING on your face  which is so nice. You can almost feel your skin thanking you  as it definitely does its job as a moisturizer really well  WITHOUT causing any breakouts (as almost every moisturizer invented tends to do to me). Best of all  after only a couple weeks of use  I could see my skin tone evening out and old acne scars starting to disappear!  I don t use it every night because I know from experience to only use a moisturizer when my skin actually starts to feel dry... so I alternate between this and the Acne Control Lotion. I ve also learned that in winter I need to moisturize 2-3 times as often as I do in the warmer/humid months.  Some reviewers disliked the scent or found it too perfume-y  but I am extremely sensitive to perfumes and chemical smells (like get migraines sitting next to people wearing too much hairspray sensitive)  and this scent doesn t bother me at all. It s clean and light  and basically disappears after the first few minutes.
6189,StrBellydSneetch,0,10-Jun-19,One person found this helpful,I ve never has a bad reaction to anything I ve used on my face  but I can t say the same about this moisturizer. Within 2-3 days of use  the skin on my upper cheeks (near my under eye area) became red and inflamed  like it was extremely dry  chapped  or burned. I noticed the rest of my face reacted similarly  just to a lesser extent than the sensitive eye area. I stopped use immediately  but even the most gentle of skin products burned for several days after using this product. I loved the smooth feel the lotion gave immediately after use  but could not recommend.
6190,Jessica,1,17-Sep-18,,I had to put a lot of thought into buying this for around $18. I finally just bought a jar to test it  kind of hoping that I’d just dislike it and call off the entire idea. It’s so SMALL and I live off of a tight budget -BUT- it only took a tiny little bit to cover my entire face. I was dreading how often I’d have to rebuy it  but it lasts longer longer than I could have possibly imagined. I spent over a week using just the blop that was on the inside of the lid.  On to the actual usage  I’m loving how well it works with keeping my skin moisturized. I go to sleep soon after I apply it  and it doesn’t feel like it’s smearing onto my pillowcase. Thicker moisturizers always felt like they wanted to make themselves far too much at home onto my poor pillow. I have acne prone skin  but the gel doesn’t cause any issues with pore clogging. I wake up and my skin is still soft and healthy looking  so I am a happy customer.
6191,R S.,1,04-May-19,,I purchased this from the local Walgreens and I love it. I wanted to leave a review because many complain that it burns at first.  I am an esthetician and I will tell you that yes  this will burn if your face is super dry. It s temporary... it does not mean the product is bad. It simply means your skin is super dry and it needs the moisture. Keep using it and use it after you come out of the shower. It will absorb better.  Eventually once your skin is finally nourished  it will stop burning. I love this product and I will continue using it. I use it in combination with regular olive oil. Meaning  I put this on after a shower  then once it s absorbed  it will put on a THIN layer of REGULAR olive oil. Olive oil has healing properties and it s great for your face especially if you have oily skin. P.S. Oil dissolves oil and I recommend this to all my clients.
6192,Amber,0,19-Feb-18,3 people found this helpful,If you a prone to acne  do not get this. It’s full of silicone which just make your skin feel soft all while clogging your pores. I used this for the first time the other day at bedtime  I woke up to acne COVERING my forehead  chin  cheeks..you name it. I tried to figure out what was doing this  and this was the ONLY new product I had been using. I really wanted to love this! I had been using Tatcha Water Cream  but it’s so expensive  I figured I’d try something a little more less costly. Guess this really shows you  you get what you pay for.
6193,J.H.,1,09-Oct-18,,I ve all but shunned drug store brand products. Prestige brands can be mind blowing. I had just finished my jar of Peter Thomas Roth s version of hyaluronic gel moisturizer. A deal at Costco made me try this and I m impressed. I actually like it better than the PTR I had been using. Its light and cool. Glides on and penetrates quickly with no heavy feel or tacky residue. No scents or perfume or harsh dyes. Suitable for all skin types including those with sensitive skin. I use nightly Retin A so I need a non sensitizing deep moisturizer. This is perfect and the price is a steal if you find a pack of two from one of the club stores. I m buying the eye gel next. I m hooked. With no residue and lightweight formula will be perfect for oily types as well. No greasy layer of thick moisturizer cream!
6194,JJ,1,21-May-18,,I purchased this product from the biggest retailer out there and it was much cheaper. I ve been looking for a sunblock that works on dark brown  chocolate-colored  African American skin  so I ve tried a ton of other brands. Every one of them has disappointed me. Some have been less white than others but they all leave a white or purplish glow that is very unattractive. I can truly say the Hydro Boost water gel lotion sunscreen by Neutrogena does not leave a tint of any kind on my skin. Amazing! It actually looks like there is nothing on my skin! It s not oily at all. Wow! I just hope it doesn t break me out. I just tried it yesterday for the first time and so far no rash! Yay!!! I hope it works on my 9 year-old daughter s skin. Hers is a bit more sensitive than mine. If either of us gets a rash  I will update my review.
6195,Isabel,1,22-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,I swear I came on amazon to write a review because even tho i bought this at target it neeeds to be known how incredibly amazing this stuff is.  my skin is as sensitive as a newborn baby. anything too harsh and immediately my eczema flairs up; it hurts and feels super tight. i did go in rather skeptical as neutrogena has never been fair to my skin. i tried it on my chin area and gave it a minute to let my skin  react . absolutely NOTHING happened except my skin absorbed it and just about felt like kim kardashian’s after a vampire facial. next i put it on my cheeks because those absolutely react to wind blowing too hard. what do you know? SOFT AGAIN.  i haven’t shut up about this stuff since using it and it’s only been the first time ever so I’m excited to see how my skin improves after using it for longer.  thank you neutrogena for this product  I’m on my way to buy the eye serum and spf products next.
6196,4 Dogs and Counting,1,31-May-16,One person found this helpful,I absolutely love this product. This is the first product Ive ever tried with hyaluronic acid in it and I am definitely in love  Ive been using it now for about 6 months and have gone through about 3 or 4 pots so I feel need to give this product the praise it deserves! I would like to start that I have combination skin  I have an extremely oil T-zone and then my cheeks are either normal but dry patches or just flat out dry. Because of my oily skin and my tendency to break out I have to be extremely careful of the moisturizers I use  but this one definitely has its place in my every day beauty routine. I will say that I use this moisturizer (the water gel version) during the day  and something more intense for the night time. I was my face  use my toner  then this little guy  allow it to dry and then proceed with my makeup routine.  I will say I think the packaging and little pot is beautiful  might not matter to some people  but I think its quite beautiful on my nightstand and love the way it looks.  I will also say that I do really like the smell  but that is coming from someone who is not sensitive to smells at all  I don t like fruity smells  but to me this has a light clean smell that I just love.  I will also mention that this has never clogged by pore like some moisturizers and is perfect for someone who is acne prone.  [...]
6197,Sara,1,16-Dec-16,,I have the definition of combination skin. (or rather  had) super oily t zone and dry patches around my mouth and cheeks and some mild fine lines around my eyes and forehead (I m 27) I was always wary of using heavy moisturizers out of fear of breaking out. I tried Olay s regenerist serum  hearing that it was great for combo skin and wouldn t cause issues  but after a week  I had cystic acne forming on my chin and whiteheads on my cheeks  so that got thrown away.  This gel is deeply hydrating and soaks in right away but does leave a smooth finish  similar to a primer thats got dimethicone in it. I personally like this feeling and it has helped me on days where I dont feel like applying a primer and foundation  I can skip a step and use just the hydro gel.  It has also drastically evened out my skin. Now  I still use extra on my dry bits and let it soak in  applying a thin layer in other parts and its created a perfect balance. I m going to subscribe to this so I don t run out--that s how good this is.  It also doesn t have a strong fragrance and doesn t have strong color. The jar is an attractive blue and looks nice on my counter but the cream is just ever so slightly tinted. So no worries there.
6198,Scubaswan,1,07-Jan-18,,I ve been using this  the Hydro Boost with SPF 15  and the Hydro Cleanser for years. I have dry  sensitive skin and the products work perfectly for me. I love how it soaks right into my skin and locks in the moisture all day. It never feels sticky or greasy afterwards. I prefer the tube moisturizer in the summer when I m outside more often because it has a really nice SPF that actually works.  BTW: It comes in a fragrance free variety for those with fragrance issues. Honestly  try just READING product descriptions if you have specific needs  instead of just buying whatever  and then giving a negative review about something that was in the description in the first place.
6199,Vic Grace,1,30-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,For $14.00 I think this product is great. I have very dry and sensitive skin and this did not break me out. I usually use the Cinique s moisture surge but I unfortunately ran out and was too broke at the time to buy it again. This is not a perfect dupe for the moisture surge but it gets the job done. If you have very dry skin  I would recommend putting a hydrating serum before this and it will be more effective. The only thing I commend as well is that it s not very oily or thick. It s a thicker consistency but it doesn t feel heavy or oily on the skin. I am not giving this 5 stars because it doesn t quite last all day but I think it is worth the $14 dollars to try.
6200,Mikaela,1,14-Jun-19,One person found this helpful,This is the BEST facial moisturizer I ve found. Now  I m no expert on skincare; I just go into a consistent skincare routine this year  but it s such an amazing product. I live in Denver where it s extremely dry (technically Denver s a desert) and this worked instantly. It s a light  soft and smooth gel that I don t even notice once it s soaked into my skin! There s no scent which is awesome. I m trying to be aware of what my skincare products are made of and all of the ingredients are super easy to read! Plus  you really don t need to use much for the day! It seems like this container will last me for a full year  even if I use it every single morning. This is a must buy.
6201,Tia phongsavat,1,30-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,I have been using this moisturizer for about 3 months now and I’m so happy I tried it out! I have sensitive and pretty normal to dry skin. I was nervous to try it cause usually when I try new products I have break outs... but not with this product!! The consistency is so silky smooth with a very light fresh smell and makes my skin moisturized without feeling heavy or greasy. I use it morning and night and I’ve even noticed a smoother texture on my face. My absolute favorite  definitely worth the buy!!
6202,withredpen,1,23-Jun-19,,If even light fragrances bother you  maybe you should skip this one. But if you’re okay with them give this a chance. I wasn’t sure what to expect at first so I got the trial size a couple weeks ago. I love this product and use it daily. It’s very moisturizing and feels good when I put it on after washing my face. I’ve been using it morning and night and love the way my skin feels afterward. Recommend and I will repurchase the regular size.
6203,Nathaniel Heneghan,1,21-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,I’ve been using gel moisturizer from Japan over 15years and since I moved to US I was hoping to be able to get it in local store(it’s so annoying to order from Japan) so  I was thrilled when Neutrogena produced a gel series. They didn’t betray my feeling :) these products are the way better than the ones from Japan :) I’m so happy to meet this product. Please please don’t discontinue this product ;)  Tips for keep it moisture your skin : Spray lots of water based toner as soon as you finish washing your face. (I make myself as I’m an aromatherapist. Use  distilled water  add plant based glycerin  add few lavender essential oil) Then  put Neutrogene Hydro Boost serum  then Neutrogena Hydro Boost moisturizer and put celave cream. Those works really good.
6204,Julie Mok,1,01-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,I like this one but I prefer the Garnier Moisture Bomb more because the moisture seems to retain longer on my skin and it also smells better (just a matter of preference). Overall  this one is still great for what it claims to do. I d try the Garnier one too if you like this one! https://www.amazon.com/Garnier-SkinActive-Moisture-Anti-Oxidant-Moisturizer/dp/B01M7TXCK3
6205,Debra Brinkman,1,10-Dec-14,,I have tried so many different moisturizers on my face  and while many of them make a difference  at least when I use them consistently  very few actually leave me really happy.  Neutrogena s Hyrdo Boost Water Gel makes me happy.  First  I didn t notice a scent  unless I really stuck my nose up next to the jar and sniffed. When I m just putting it on my face  I don t notice it at all.  Second  I m at that menopausal stage of life  which means I have very dry skin on much of my face  but huge outbreaks of acne on my chin. My chin is always dry too  and no  I can t explain it. When I first used the Hydro Boost  I avoided my chin. I put the gel onto my cheeks  around my eyes  on my forehead... and it just soaked in quickly and left my skin feeling cool and smooth. Like I had just given it a drink of water.  After a couple of days  I tried it on my chin too  and have been doing so ever since. The acne isn t any worse  and in fact  my chin feels healthier.  So yes... something I can put on my whole face that doesn t feel greasy  just light and fresh. It s a winner in my book.
6206,barbANDjess,1,23-May-19,,I’m so glad I found this moisturizer! I’ve tried endless products only to be just mildly satisfied. It has completely changed my skin from combination/sensitive/acne-prone to such an amazing texture and look! I swear it seemed like since the first time I used it my skin is so much healthier  it’s almost like a glow. I’m on my third jar and I’ve been recommending it to others it’s so good!
6207,Christina,1,08-Apr-18,,My dermatologist recommended this for the dry and flaking skin I was getting from using my RetinA acne medication. This worked magnificently! I did not get any irritation  acne  or allergic reaction to using this as some reviewers had. So  your mileage may vary depending on sensitive your skin is  but I am happy with this moisturizer. My skin feels plump  smooth  and hydrated. I would definitely recommend giving this a try  especially if you re using RetinA.
6208,Carmen,1,15-Jul-15,One person found this helpful,I have been using this product for so many years... Probably around 8 years. It was only available in Asia before and I am not sure why Neutrogena didn t offer it in the USA. Most moisturizers in the USA are too heavy for summer and I had a difficult time to find something lighter in drugstores.  OK  speaking as a user of this product for 8 years  this is a great product for the summer  when the humidity is relatively high. Usually I apply twice on my face and it s good to go. Quick absorption. Not sticky. It s not enough for me during the winter  but I use it as the  base  before applying richer moisturizer. Also I use it to moisturize my skin before putting on makeup.
6209,Ryan Allen,0,13-Jan-19,2 people found this helpful,i used to love this product. then i guess they updated it? it used to be a blue moisturizer that worked great and now it’s white ?? and NOT good. the new formula made my skin breakout because there is fragrance in it. why would you put fragrance in a skin care product?? i’m so upset and have to find a new moisturizer : /
6210,Chanda,1,04-Dec-18,,Got this a week ago because I started getting adult ance and started using clearasil rapid rescue and it dried my skin out so bad I couldnt put baby lotion on it  not even vaseline it burned so bad. So I got this stuff and it burn slightly but it was tolerable. I knew it would probably burn some anyways bc my skin was so dry and irritated so I dont blame this product for the burn. After 6 days of using this my skin was healed enough to use a scrub to scrub off the itchy dead skin. Now today I put this on again and my skin is amazing feeling. So soft  redness is going away  no dry itch and it doesn t make my ance worse . I wont use stuff for ance without this product again!
6211,Jen,1,23-Feb-19,,I love this product! It works great for me. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft without feeling greasy. It’s winter so I have been using it morning and night. My make up works well over it and I am loving the texture and suppleness of my skin. I am very impressed with this product and would like to try the serum and body moisturizer as well.
6212,S siler,0,26-Jul-18,3 people found this helpful,This stuff burns my eyes really bad! Even if I don’t put it anywhere near my eyes some how it always finds it way into my eye ball causing burning and watering. I’m throwing it in the trash immediately
6213,Drew Stanley,1,04-Jan-19,,I’ve tried some many skin care products  it’s unreal. Most of the moisturizers I use end up making my skin feel tacky and thick. The last moisturizer I tried was from Cetaphil and it was exactly that  ended up waking up with a few breakouts because of it. My skin is very oily on my forehead  but dry everywhere else to where it feels like a slight burn. I decided to try this because of the reviews and I’m glad I did! So pleased with this after a week. It dries kinda slow  but I usually put on quite a bit. No sticky feeling at all. My skin feels incredibly soft now! I bought this at Target and also bought the nighttime face mask individuals as well. Highly recommend those too!

6215,DSGosha,1,25-Feb-15,,I m writing this about 2 hours after using my Influenster Neutrogena® Hydro Boost Water Gel with hyaluronic acid and I must say that my skin is still super soft and springy. My T-zone is normally really dry and cracked especially during winter and especially since I ve been sick lately  but at this point my skin is so smooth  my fingers feel like they re gliding over my face. I m super happy with the immediate results  and even now it still have that fresh washed face feeling that I had when I first applied it. I highly recommend for people with super dry skin like me.  Product featured was received free to test and review by Influenster.
6216,Ray,0,09-Oct-18,2 people found this helpful,I moisturize atleast twice a day  especially my face after showers.. this product does not work as well as it should and does not leave your skin moisturized for longer than an hour or two  with this being the only moisturizer I use it has left my face dry and I can’t rely on it  wasted money if you ask me.
6217,Alex Hoover,0,11-Feb-18,One person found this helpful,I bought the product two months ago  and recently had to switch moisturizers. At first  this moisturizer worked great for my combo skin. After a few months  it basically stopped moisturizing my skin-- even when I would apply multiple layers my skin would end up dry and flaky.  Update: I have continued to use the product as not to waste it  but I swear this product also evaporates out of the jar because it had been a week since I last used it and there is significantly less in the package.
6218,NN1985,1,05-Mar-16,One person found this helpful,I bought this at the drugstore and used it last night. Im 30 years now  and was looking for a new moisturizer. I bought the gel cream  not water gel. My skin *oily/combination* has been very acne prone and irritated the past months (I usually have clear skin). Even though my breakouts where slowly dissapearing  my skin was looking dry/irritated and the scars visible.  I used this cream last night and loved how non greasy it is. It literally sinks into skin. In the morning i noticed my skin looked much better: calm  moisturized  no additional break outs. Will continue to use.
6219,Nicole G,1,11-Jan-18,,I purchased this product for my Mom after she had received a sample for her dermatologist. She is crazy in love with it  and claims it is the perfect moisturizer! In New York we ve been having extra cold days and nights and she said the only part of her body that isn t dry is her face! The texture is great. It absorbs into the skin beautifully. She definitely recommends this product to all!
6220,Natalie Dawn,1,29-Nov-14,2 people found this helpful,As far as how the product feels and works: I like it  just a little does a great job of moisturizing without clogging your pores or feeling heavy on your skin. I also think it smells really nice  to me it smells similar to roses  but I have been told that I have a weird sense of smell so I wouldn t guarantee that.  The thing that did bother was the word acid  in the front label. I thought   Gee is it really a good idea to spread acid on your face every morning??   So I looked it up on webmd here is part of what they say about it:   Hyaluronic acid is a substance that is naturally present in the human body. It is found in the highest concentrations in fluids in the eyes and joints. The hyaluronic acid that is used as medicine is extracted from rooster combs or made by bacteria in the laboratory... There is also a lot of interest in using hyaluronic acid to prevent the effects of aging. In fact  hyaluronic acid has been promoted as a  fountain of youth.  However  there is no evidence to support the claim that taking it by mouth or applying it to the skin can prevent changes associated with aging.   Whether that is something you are comfortable with or not is up to you but I thought everyone should know. This product does work  but I have been using aloe vera gel with vegetable glycerin for months and it works just as well  is cheaper  and isn t made from rooster combs or bacteria in a lab. I think this is a nice product and works well but I wouldn t buy it when there is cheaper  more natural and just as effective to use.
6221,AshleyH,1,25-Nov-16,One person found this helpful,10+ stars. Worth way more than 5 stars! My favorite lotion I ve tried in YEARS! This is the best lotion for my skin. It makes my face soft and supple and not as oily as others. I heard of this from my curiology prescription and haven t found another quiet like this. I ve tried Garnier but .... it s just not the same. Do yourself a favor and buy this one. Not any of the other brands. THIS ONE!
6222,cat,1,23-Aug-17,,I had high expectations going in and I was not disappointed. I like what hyaluronic acid does for my skin but I hate the sticky feeling I ve felt using other products. This moisturizer goes on really smooth  fresh  and doesn t leave the skin feeling sticky at all. I tend to get less acne when my skin is hydrated  so this is an important part of my new routine. The smell is nice and relatively light  which I like.
6223,Shopinista,0,20-May-19,,After a week of application my eyes  mouth area and neck area turned red with a rash and the burning sensation was too much for me to continue using this product. By the following week  I had a full on chemical burn around my eyes  mouth and my neck. I read a couple reviews on Amazon  and a lot of people said the same thing. They should really check what they’re putting in this product because it’s not supposed to burn your skin.
6224,Leah,1,23-Feb-19,One person found this helpful,There is a big key to making this work. When I first used it  it dried my face out so bad and I normally have oily skin. My skin was literally flaking off. Then I read more about hyaluronic acid and learned you have to have your face damp or wet when you apply it . Now I love it. I wish they were a little more clear in their instructions though.
6225,Isabelle Giersz,1,14-Feb-19,,I received this as a gift from my mother. I applied this to my skin as soon as I got it. My face soaks this up like a and my face feels very soft. With my extreme dry skin  this gel may not be enough for my face and I still need to use a thick cream over the night. However  this makes the perfect day cream as it s water based and soaks up extremely fast.
6226,Christina Leigh,1,17-Oct-18,,I was actually a lot more impressed with this gel than I thought I was going to be. It smells really good and is super lightweight on the skin  although it provides a ton of hydration. Visit my blog at christinaschiccorner.com to read my more detailed review I wrote about it.
6227,Renz,1,12-Mar-15,,I got this free from Influenster for testing purposes. All opinions are mine.  I loved the packaging of this product it really does fit in with the name  water gel . The actual moisturizer is very very light which I liked very much and I really felt that my face was moisturized after it as applied. It is very light another plus as I hate having heavy creams on my face.  My only gripe with this which has me toggling between I like and it s ok is that I don t find it lasts all day and it is not spf. I would like to continue to use this for some more time before I actually decide it it s a LOVE
6228,Daniel the Quilter,1,22-May-18,,i just finished a jar. its great for under eye  only a small dab will do ya. its completely water based and melts into your delicate under eye perfectly. it takes times  but u do see a noticeable difference in the elasticity and smoothness under and around the eye area due to the hydration.
6229,Sabrina Kirkines Haynes,1,31-Mar-19,,Love! I typically have oily  acne prone skin and hate almost every moisturizer I have tried but I’m on week 3 of this and I have to say I really love it! It’s perfect under makeup  and doesn’t seem to cause any additional break outs!
6230,Trangirl,0,12-May-19,,Get the  Extra-Dry  version. This version is heavily scented. I am not usually sensitive to fragrant  but this is a little too much. Don t know why they include fragrant in this. I love the extra dry version  no smell!
6231,That1GingerGirl,1,27-Feb-15,,I just received this wonderful Product in the mail from Influenster for free to review!! I have to say that I put this on about 10 minutes ago and my skin still feels amazing! It’s a very lightweight product and feels sort of like water. It does not have any crazy smell to it. I have some acne on my skin right now and it did not bother it at all. I am very impressed with this product as I have always had a hard time finding something to hydrate my face and this does just that! I would definitely buy this product again and again! as again  I did get this product for free  but the opinion of this product is my own. :)
6232,Kimberly Ann Jennings,1,24-Dec-18,,I use this moisturizer religiously. I mix in a dropper full of rose hip oil and the mixture has worked wonders on my acne scars and textured skin. This moisturizer can be worn under makeup or at night. I will never use another moisturizer again!
6233,Amy Goebel Padgett,1,27-Dec-14,2 people found this helpful,I love this cream and plan on getting more this coming summer. It s a little light for the winter (for me) but I love the clean  refreshing feel of it and like I said  I m buying more this summer. I have fair  combo skin that is now aging so it s always a problem finding a nice cream that is not greasy. This cream is wonderful--it doesn t feel greasy at all and absorbs right in. I feared it might not go on very well because of it being a  water gel  but it is very  very smooth and goes on great.  it is not perfumey  either  which I really appreciate. It has a very light and pleasant odor that I personally find refreshing.  It is not quite  heavy  enough for me for winter wear when the dry areas on my face really get dry  but for other seasons  this is the perfect cream for me. I really like it under makeup  too  because it doesn t make my makeup  slip off  or  clump up  or go on in weird patterns which some other crams can do to you.  Hope this helps.
6234,Amazon Customer,1,05-Mar-16,,I have been looking for a product that was going to smooth out my face and give me that  bounce  back that the so wonderful Disney princess described in the commercial for this. I can say with full confidence that I have never used a better product. My face is so much smoother and softer than it EVER has been  and that is not even the slightest bit dramatic. I would rival my skin with my 3 year olds anytime! I have also always had a small issue with acne and overly oily skin  and some how this product even seems to be managing that. To think that I have picked up this item and put it back a hundred time because  like others I m sure  I was so over spending a small fortune on another product that says one thing and does another. Worth every penny. Also though it seems like a small jar  a very little bit of this will go a long way!! So happy I bought this  I WILL be recommending this to all the women in my family!
6235,Ale.Mac.Dee,1,14-Mar-15,,I live in the California desert weather where it is extremely cold and extremely hot. Really there is no happy medium. I have to carry moisturizer in both seasons  but especially in the winter. I have combination skin and in the summer where my mouth and nose area tends to dry and peel. In the winter  the same areas tend to be tight and itchy along with my chin and cheekbone area. Needless to say  I have all sorts of moisturizers. I am in love with the fact that I do not need to reapply this gel multiple times throughout the day. I apply the Neutrogena Gel once in the morning and once in the evening after I have washed my face. That is it!  When I apply the Hydro Boost Water Gel my skin immediately feels refreshed  smooth  and vibrant. To date  this is the only product that has made me feel like this on first application and with no side effects. It absorbs quickly into my skin and my face is not extra shinny  it does not burn  and it is not greasy. All positive factors in my book. My skin is no longer itchy  tight  red  or peeling. I have somewhat sensitive skin and I feared the interaction between the chemicals in this product and ProActiv. To my surprise there was no reaction  no worsening or peeling of my skin.  I love it and am shocked that it did not have the same results for others. On the positive side for these folks it that there is Hydro Boost Gel-Cream for Extra Dry Skin! I will be purchasing the Hydro Boost Gel Eye Cream....hopefully this has fantastic results for me also.  I received and tested this product for free from Influenster. This review is my honest and personal views after testing the product for 3 weeks. I am hooked and I can honestly say that I will continue to use this in the winter....and hopefully in the summer as well. We will see how that goes as I haven t had the pleasure to test this product in the summer.
6236,Cre Samuel,1,02-Mar-15,One person found this helpful,I have loved Neutrogena products all my life. My mother raised my sister and I on these products. Whenever a new one comes out I m excited to try it. This Hydro Boost came out at the perfect time. My skin is so dry and tight this time of year. I received a full size product for free thanks to Influenster. I washed my face as normal and then applied this gel. My skin felt amazing just after 1 application! My skin felt nice and hydrated  no greasy. Neutrogena did it again with a fabulous and affordable product!!
6237,Wolfmama,1,23-Mar-19,,This stuff if pretty great  probably even better in the summer - however it is SCENTED - which I hate. Also the packaging on top of being incredibly wasteful - is not suited to the consistency of the gel - a tube would be better. Not sure if I will purchase again - but it’s good enough to finish.
6238,Singstarshine,1,23-Feb-18,,My first jar of this I used nightly and I wasn t really impressed  but after it ran out I struggled through the winter with impossible to cover redness and bumpy rough texture across my cheeks and nose. I ve always had oily/combo skin but now I know my skin is just thirsty! I got rid of my exfoliating cleanser  bought the hydro boost cleanser  and am back to using this gel day and night. Within two days I went from having skin so bad a makeup artist asked if I had eczema to clearer  smoother  and even toned.
6239,tibbyme,1,03-Mar-15,,I got this to test via Influester and their VoxBox. The packaging is pretty! On first sniff  the scent is light but nice. A deeper sniff brings me some floral with the typical  lotion  smell. The texture is light and is easily spread over my skin. It absorbed quickly and my skin does feel a bit smoother. As someone with dry skin  this is fantastic for adding a bit of moisture to my skin. However  because it is so light  it s not a great long term moisturizer but more of a I need a touchup during the day. My skin feels cooler after using it too!
6240,Amy M.,0,25-Feb-15,One person found this helpful,This product has a very nice feel and a light  refreshing scent. It is a very light moisturizer  which I personally prefer. A little bit goes a LONG way  which is nice. The reason for my poor review really comes down to the ingredients. I personally don t feel that fragrance and  blue 1  are necessary in skin care. I ll freely admit to being fairly crunchy on the skincare front  so this is probably something I ll pass along to a friend with less sensitive skin.
6241,Amazon Customer,1,29-Oct-18,One person found this helpful,Here’s the lowdown: If you have acne prone  combo skin  this is an incredible moisturizer. If you have extremely dry skin it wouldn’t be enough  but if you have oily skin it doesn’t feel sticky or heavy. It’s so cooling  has an aloe vera smell to it  and soaks in to the skin so beautifully. It’s truly one of the best moisturizers I have ever used  and I find it so nice in the winter time.
6242,Kathleen Cronk,1,21-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,I never write reviews. This stuff is the ONLY thing that saves my face in the winter. I am fair skinned and work outside in harsh Buffalo NY winters. Everything else I have tried leaves me feeling only superficially moist. My skin would still remain dry almost to the point of painful. This product was suggested to me by a fellow horse -woman and she could not have been more right!!
6243,Maya D.,1,26-Aug-17,,I ve been using the product for over a week now and it has done wonders for my combination skin! My skin is dry for the most part  but my T-zone tends to get oily throughout the day. This product also does an awesome job as a makeup primer - my foundation is still on at the end of the day and post-work out (and my skin isn t oily!). Just a warning: a little goes a long way with this product. A simple dab of your finger in the jar is enough. Will definitely be buying this product again!
6244,Al,0,11-Dec-17,2 people found this helpful,This gel does not moisturize at all  and I find myself having to apply more after each use. It s just a bunch of cheap silicones mixed together to create this junk. Even after applying a liberous amount  I still have dry skin on my cheek bones and nose edges. Smells awful too.
6245,Emily Carter,1,26-Mar-19,,Smells like laundry detergent which makes me feel like I’m putting chemicals on my skin. So far no break outs or allergic reactions though. My skin is okay. It just smells like chemicals and strong fragrances. This won’t be good for sensitive skin.
6246,JMM90,1,18-Jun-19,,Best moisturizer out there. You can feel it penetrating into the pores. It s like a glass of water for your face!  My only con is they don t put enough in the container.
6247,JMamaB,0,22-Aug-18,One person found this helpful,I was using Neutrogena s cream cleanser and thought this would be a good match. Unfortunately  my skin has been exceptionally dry since using this product. I ve been slathering it on at night and in the morning  and it s not doing the trick. I will not be buying this again.
6248,Christine,1,03-Feb-18,,I don t usually finish any moisturizer I buy  go from one to the other. Until I found this  I have already gone thru 1 jar  and on my 2nd one. I love this moisturizer  light  soothing  not greasy melts into skin  love the gel. Plan on using this for a long long time.
6249,wolf,1,09-Jan-16,,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff! First  it goes on so smooth you don t even realize you have it on. It makes your face feel great. It s not heavy or greasy. I was previously using Olay moisturizer and don t get me wrong  I love that stuff as well  but it felt greasy at times. It was a huge difference the first time I used Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel. Secondly  it lasted for over 24 hours. Even after working 8 hours  blowing my nose a million times because of the cooler weather  and so on. My Olay couldn t do that. I would have to reapply Olay after I blew my nose because I would get dry spots from rubbing the tissue. A previous reviewer said she wouldn t use this in the winter months but I would disagree. I think it s fantastic for the winter months. That s when my face needs the most hydration and moisturizing.
6250,Monica,1,09-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,Not heavy  not sticky  very hydrating without being greasy. I have normal skin and combination sometimes and my grandma has dry skin it works for both of us. Worth every penny.

6252,Celena Miller,1,29-Apr-19,,I see a dermatologist for rosacea and this is the nighttime part of my daily routine. My face feels so soft after using it. I think the jar is really pretty too.
6253,Michelle anderson,1,10-Dec-16,,This is a great product ! I have spent a small fortune on facial products . This beats out my upper end creams . Moisturizing and last throughout the day . Fine lines and wrinkles are less noticeable . Goes on smooth and absorbs quickly without leaving your face greasy like other moisturizers can . Make up lays beautifully on top . I highly recommend !
6254,sunshine lee,0,01-Dec-15,11 people found this helpful,I bought this as a dupe for Clinique moisture surge. Bad idea. This irritates my skin and my forehead actually feels drier since starting using this a few weeks ago.
6255,Paige,0,23-Mar-19,,I really dont like it. It smells like laundry detergent and it just doesnt work well for me. I bought it based on the many many good reviews. I dont like the way it feels on my skin  it makes my skin feel tight instead of moisturized. Waste of money. It s just sitting in my draw with the rest of my cosmetic things.
6256,Emily J. Morris,1,02-Dec-14,,I ve been using this gel for a little over a week now. While it is nice enough as moisturizers go  I can t say it s my favorite and I don t know if I ll be turning to it again in the future. Yes  it makes a go at keeping my normal skin moisturized all day  I struggle with a lingering greasy feeling for up to an hour after application  despite a very modest usage. I like the clean scent  and yes  it does moisturize as promised  but not as well as other products I ve tried. Good effort  but not the best.
6257,carolinawren,1,05-Aug-18,,This is my first face moisturizer and I am liking it so far. It’s not thick and creamy like lotions  which I like because it doesn’t leave residue on my hands. It feels refreshing on my face. I’ve been applying in the morning and at night  and my skin feels soft.
6258,Kindle Customer,1,12-Dec-14,,Light to the touch  pleasant scent  and seems to hydrate winter-worn skin nicely  this product is one I will definitely buy again. While I think aging skin is just that -- aging and therefore of a different texture than that of your people  it is definitely drier and needs a bit more lubrication/hydration to make it through the day  and this product provides that without making the skin greasy. It is light and seems to be quite effective  and the container is pretty on the bathroom counter.
6259,Selena Brown,1,23-Mar-15,,After more than 14 days of using Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel  I am very pleased. Initially  when I first cleaned my face and then applied this water gel  it absorbed very quickly into my skin. It was like my skin was a sponge and I didn t see any moisture or glow. I have combination skin and have dry skin in certain areas of my face so I first used this product without applying makeup all day and went out on my errands. By the end of the first day  I noticed how my skin was actually glowing and had a calm  supple  appearance. The water gel definitely appeared to work from the inside out without making me look greasy. I also used this product with the my makeup application process and noticed that it did not conflict with that routine either. There was not too much moisture to conflict with my makeup. Ironically  I was finished with another moisturizer that I was trying until I found a permanent one  and then I was invited to test this Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel for free. I am glad that I had the opportunity to try it. I like it a lot and will continue to use it as my now permanent moisturizer. Although  I was invited to test Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel for free  this review is totally my opinion and my opinion alone.Your experience may vary.
6260,Lindsey Braem,1,04-Mar-15,,After a face mask this weekend  I needed some additional moisturizer. The winter has admittedly been a little rough on my skin  especially my poor  dry cheeks. I am so used to lotions and creams  so it was a different feel to use a gel. It was immediately cooling on my face  which felt very good  especially post-mask. Most importantly  it wasn t at all irritating as I find many products are. I did notice my skin feeling significantly more hydrated.  I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free  but all opinions are my own.
6261,Mike,1,22-May-19,,My slime is acne-prone. I’ve tried a bunch of other moisturizers  including ones specifically for acne-prone skin. I tried this and won’t use anything else! Try it. See for yourself. It’s perfect. ??
6262,knitwit,0,22-May-19,,Very runny. Made my face break out which I have not had a problem with for 40 years. Too much unrecyclable packaging.
6263,Jamie,1,16-May-17,,I break out so easily with any moisturizers but this one actually improved my skin without causing any breakouts! It absorbs immediately and doesn t feel greasy or heavy while really adding moisture to my skin. I use it on the back of my hands too and it makes my skin feel like silk.
6264,Kristy,1,12-Mar-15,,I normally have combination skin. At 8 months into pregnancy  my skin is more unpredictable than ever. That is why when I had the opportunity to give Neutrogena’s Hydro Boost Water Gel a try  I was excited.  Within moments of apply this product to my face I had a noticeable different in the texture of my skin. My rough texture on my jaw line was gone  leaving my face smooth and soft.  Applying it was a breeze. It has a different type of consistency similar to that between a cream & a gel but without the sticky texture of gel or the greasy feeling of some creams. It did not make my skin  shine  with leftover residue  instead it provides a natural  glow . (I’ve finally gotten the  pregnancy makes you glow!  comments. I’m not afraid to share my little secret that pregnancy has nothing to do with it!)  I received Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free  but all opinions are of my own. I will be continuing to purchase this product.
6265,Kelli,1,16-Mar-18,,The entire Neutrogena hydro boost line is legit. I love this stuff and can’t rave enough about it. It feels really nice and light going on  but it truly does hydrate your skin. It also makes your skin feel extremely soft. I honestly think it feels and performs like a high end skin care product for a budget friendly price.
6266,Kim,1,06-Mar-15,,I recently began using this product every morning after I shower. I live in Colorado where it is very dry in the winter time (I used to like in Georgia where there is some humidity in the winter time that doesn t completely dry me out). I ve had a hard time finding a moisturizer that keeps my face hydrated all day long. FINALLY I found my product! I have noticed such a huge difference in my how my skin feels after just a week of using this moisturizer. It is softer and always feels hydrated! Just wish they made water gel lotions for your WHOLE body! I also love that it doesn t take much of this product to cover my whole face. This a great product that I was lucky enough to test out as a free sample. All opinions are my own and will most certainly be buying more when my sample runs out!  Only reason this product did not receive full stars is because I still find it to be a little on the expensive side for a drugstore moisturizer.
6267,Shelley Winterer,1,12-Mar-15,,This was my first time using a gel instead of a cream moisturizer and I was extremely surprised at how effective this product is! I was immediately impressed with the light fragrance and cool feeling that it provided on my skin. I did not have to use much and my skin was instantly well moisturized and smooth. I love how fast it absorbed and didn t leave any kind of residue and the benefits lasted all day. I ve been using this product for several weeks now and I have been recommending it to everyone I know! It works even better than the $50 cream I ve been using for years.  Disclaimer: I did receive this product for free from influenster for testing purposes but the opinions above are all my own--I love this product and I m so glad I tried it!!
6268,Anne-Marie G,1,14-Dec-14,3 people found this helpful,I REALLY like this.  It goes on with no scent  my skin sucks it right in. And unlike any other moisturizer type product I have used--my face feels absolutely great after I put it on. It feels really smooth and fresh--no sticky feeling.  I ve been going makeup free for several days  just using this after I wash my face in the morning.  My only problem with it--is all mine  I open things at a tilt and some of it plopped right out the first time I opened it.  Definitely would get this again and recommend it to others.
6269,Blaise,1,11-May-17,2 people found this helpful,I recently purchased this at WalMart  and when I tell you I m pleased with this product!!! I mean it!!...it s a little pricey  but it s worth it IMO. Overall  it does it s job which is significant. It leaves your skin hydrated for a few days and it looks extremely radiant.
6270,Heather B.,0,30-Jun-18,,I had high hopes for this one  but I’m sadly disappointed. The texture is nice  it’s not sticky at all. But it seems to sit on the skin and not actually soak in or add any benefit. But my biggest problem is with the smell  it is intense and so fake/perfumey! I can’t wear it at night because it bothers my husband and I so much. I don’t want to waste it but trying to use it up is a chore.
6271,Taylor,1,03-Oct-18,,So I just got this only two days ago but so far it’s nice. I have oily skin and it absorbs quickly. Didn’t leave skin feeling greasy or anything. The only issue is that after a couple hours my skin feels a bit dry... So I reapply a little bit more after awhile. I definitly would not recommend this if you have really dry skin just because it leaves mine feeling a bit dry with my oily skin.
6272,Lana,1,11-Nov-18,,2 weeks of use and this has calmed my fair combo skin redness  dryness and breakouts. Twice a day and doesn’t roll up or make your face stick to your pillowcase   perfect under makeup. Really pleasant   plenty of moisture for my 50+ skin without the goopy feeling.
6273,Jenny,1,26-Mar-15,,I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free through Influenster but all opinions are my own. I live above 6500 feet  which means it s very dry here and my skin shows it. I used the Neutrogena Hydro Boost in the evenings or early mornings and then covered with a sunscreen. I can honestly say my skin feels a lot more hydrated and moisturized throughout the night. I also really like the scent of the product as it s light and refreshing. I don t really feel the need to gob this product on. I use a small pea sized amount and lightly spread it across my skin. It doesn t take much. If I use to much it feels a bit heavy and doesn t seem to work as well. A little goes a long way. The only downside to this product is that it s a bit higher priced than I d imagine for an every day drug store type product  and that s my reason for rating it 4 instead of 5 stars.
6274,Stephanie,1,23-Nov-18,,What I love about this stuff is that it absorbs in the skin beautifully - no residue  greasiness or sticky texture. Smells pleasant and won’t cause pores to get clogged.
6275,Nehanda,1,08-Jun-18,,Absolutely amazing product. Leaves ur skin feeling so hydrated. Definitely helpful in the winter time.
6276,Chelsea,1,09-Mar-15,,The Pros: Water Based - Good for people with allergies Goes on light Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft  Cons: Water Based - (a pro too  I know) - I have to put this on twice a day to really keep my skin from feeling super tight and dry  however the weather in Los Angeles has been really dry  so that might just be me. Feels like it might wear off more quickly.  Overall  I m having a good experience with this product. It leaves my skin feeling nice and soft. I like that it doesn t really feel like I m wearing anything at all and doesn t affect how my makeup goes on in a negative way.  I received Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel compliments of Influenster for testing purposes; all opinions are my own.
6277,DDC,1,26-Feb-15,,I am new to this product  but so far loving it! I ve become much more aware of what s in my products the older I get and avoiding synthetic oils whenever possible. The hydro boost water gel is water based  very light  the scent isn t cloying and it absorbed into my skin right away. Even better  there was no film left behind  irritation or feeling of tightness afterwards. My skin immediately felt some relief  even in the midst of this ridiculous (and drying) Northeast winter we re having. I think this would feel so good after being in the summer-time sun too-- it s rare to find a product that can withstand big changes in temp  but this may be it. Give it a whirl!  **Disclosure: I was provided a complimentary product for review purposes  but all opinions are entirely my own.**
6278,Faisal J.,1,25-Jan-19,,I’ve been using this product for about a week now and I can already see a difference in my skin. I have oily skin so the texture of this is perfect. It’s very light and absorbs quickly. My skin is soft  supple  and it balances out my oil so throughout the day  I face doesn’t feel oily and greasy. I will definitely be using this more in the future!
6279,Natnat,1,16-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,I love the product. Only complaint  the jar makes it appear as if there was more product then there is in the jar  Pricey.
6280,Jaime Arnold,1,03-Mar-15,,I love this product! Neutrogena has a total win here. I wanted to use it for a couple days before I posted my review to make sure it worked as good as it did on day 1. I have completely given up my face moisturizer and now just use this product! My face felt smooth and hydrated all day! I hope Neutrogena makes one for the whole body because I would totally give up lotion for this.
6281,Lisa Marie,1,28-Feb-15,,I received a free sample of this product from Influenster and first off let me tell you it smells amazing! I have dry/combination skin and this feels like silk going on. I ve only used it a couple times so we will see how it goes in the long run but for now I am pleased! It s really hard for me to find something that gives enough moisture without feeling greasy and this product does it for me! Yay!!
6282,yapee,1,31-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,Amazing gel. My wrinkles disappear over night.
6283,Rich-L,1,14-Dec-14,,Winter arrives and the skin s ability to retain moisture is dramatically challenged. I am always looking for a good moisturizer that is easy to apply  not greasy  and without a foul/strong smell. The Neutrogena product certainly seemed to be a good one. The company makes good  reasonably-priced products  so I was eager to try it. In shot  it feels great going on. A little dab will do ya really  it does not take much to get the benefit from this gel. Because it is winter  it goes on relatively cool  has a good scent  and provides good temporary moisture. This is my reason for the 4 star review. The moisture is just not sustainable over any extended time period. The publicity mentions something like 24 hours. But that just does not happen  particularly in the dry winter months....
6284,bOoKwOrM,1,26-Dec-14,,I really liked this product. So many moisturizers out there are scented  but as someone with sensitive skin  I appreciated this Neutrogena gel having no smell. It feels great on the skin and moisturizes it well. The gel itself doesn t feel greasy  and you don t need to put on a lot at a time for it to work. Overall  I would definitely recommend this Neutrogena product.
6285,Froggyabr,1,03-Mar-15,,I ve only used this for a couple of days  but I m headed into the 5 star area. However  since I ve only used this twice I can t give a full review. My first impression of this was  WOW!  My skin felt soft (and it s like a desert wasteland) so immediate first impression is awesome! The smell is light and clean. I like that I don t have that greasy residue or weird film on my skin after use. This literally sinks into the skin leaving it soft and supple. OH  and a little goes a long way! I m expecting this to last a good 6/8 months with daily use.
6286,Samantha Tillery,1,05-Mar-15,,I received the Hydro Boost Water Gel from Influenster for testing purposes and I m super glad I was chosen for this campaign. I have the hardest time finding moisturizers for my face. My skin is dry and sensitive and a lot of products leave my skin feeling greasy and sticky. This water gel is AMAZING! It goes on so smooth and easy  my skin absorbs it entirely within 30 secs to a minute and there is no greasy or sticky residue. I can put my pressed powder makeup on over it and it goes on smooth without making it look heavier. My skin feels so smooth and soft. It has a very light pleasant scent and it s cool to the touch when applying. I will definitely be purchasing this on my own once I run out. Can t wait to try the rest of this line!
6287,KaDee Oman,1,12-Jan-19,,I have such dry skin and I ve always struggled finding a moisturizer that actually works for longer than an hour or two  but this lasts all day! Thanks to this  my acne is finally starting to clear up because my face isn t a complete desert. I highly recommend it!!
6288,Kindle Customer,1,13-Nov-17,,I LOVE it! My face is so soft and my skin looks better than ever. I love the feel  it s not sticky  smells nice and is great under makeup. Just ordered it again! ??
6289,Amazon Customer,0,17-Mar-18,2 people found this helpful,Totally leaves my skin dry. Wish I could get my money back. Had to apply my L Or?al revitalift to bring back moisture and suppleness!!!!
6290,Amazon Customer,1,03-Mar-19,,As advertised... loving it already. Immediate results. Aaah
6291,Danielle,1,09-Mar-15,,I use this two times a day. Right after I wash my face in the morning and right after I get out of the shower at night. I have extremely sensitive skin and it gets very dry especially during winter time. This product feels amazing on the skin and definitely left my skin feeling hydrated! I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free from influenster and I was hesitant to try at first due to my sensitive skin. However  the gel did not leave my skin feeling irritated at all! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for something to hydrate their skin based on my personal experience. *This review is based on my personal experience and my own opinions.
6292,Ashley Angresano,1,07-Mar-15,,This product has become the perfect alternative for me to replace using face lotions that  even ones for sensitive skin  were still clogging my pores and felt heavy. However  this gel is so light  it dries quickly and doesn t leave a greasy feel. After a few days of using both morning and night  I have noticed how much softer and more hydrated my skin feels. As an added bonus  the gel smells really good so it is refreshing to put on my face in the morning and before bed. The clear jar is pretty  too!  Please note that I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel for free  but these are opinions are my own from testing this product.
6293,Morrigan Alexandros,1,04-Dec-14,One person found this helpful,I have very oily skin  so I am always careful with moisturizers. This is a very lightweight gel. After applying it to my face and neck  I noticed no residue or oiliness. It is absorbed by the skin really quickly. I thought this was going to be my nighttime moisturizer  but it can be used for the day without worrying about making the face too oily. The only issue with it being the day moisturizer is that it does not offer UV protection.  As to its effectiveness  it seems ok. I would not use this at night. I personally use a heavier moisturizer at night. But this is perfect to use before the makeup.
6294,Denise B,1,16-Oct-17,,Was looking for something not heavy but something that can moisturize my face. My sister recommended this and ii love it. When it s hot I just put a little bit and now that it s cold I put an ample amount. I also use the face wash. Works great together and my face has been smoother and not dry. Now that it s cold I have to moisturize at least twice but I love it.
6295,K. Roman,1,07-Dec-14,One person found this helpful,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel is a very smooth gel. It has a light floral aroma. It absorbs quickly and evenly. The color is more or less the color of the jar. It is not greasy. I m not allergic to it and it hasn t made me break out. The plastic jar is quite substantial. I think it works great.
6296,Lillian Santiago,0,14-Jul-15,33 people found this helpful,I was excited to try this product with the intention of possibly replacing my Clinique gel moisturizer. Unfortunately  the Neutrogena Hydro Boost caused an allergic reaction and now I m walking around with a red  swollen face.
6297,Amazon Customer,1,02-May-18,One person found this helpful,I love the way Hydro Boost makes my skin feel. It does plump the face out a little bit. I especially like the water base one more than the gel one.
6298,Tess Leggio,1,24-Feb-19,One person found this helpful,I have moderate/severe acne and this product has helped calm my skin without causing more breakouts.
6299,kelfuller77,1,13-Dec-14,One person found this helpful,I have always been a huge Neutrogena fan! I don t think I ve ever tried one of their products and not loved it. Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel is another awesome product that I m not going to be able to live without. This moisturizer is just perfection. First of all  it feels fantastic going on. It s cool and refreshing and light. It doesn t feel greasy  or leave a sheen. And best of all  it leaves my skin soft and supple. I ve noticed my skin looks healthier  brighter and even my pores seems to shrink. I absolutely adore this product!
6300,MamaHeuer,1,04-Mar-15,,I m pleasantly surprised by this gel. It doesn t have an intense smell and feels clean and smooth when I put it on  but it hasn t really quenched my dry skin like I was hoping. I live in Minnesota so the constant winter and cold air destroys my cheeks. I get itchy dry spots. I m on day 3 (I know that s not that many) and I feel myself wanting to reapply by the afternoon - even if I haven t been outside. I gave it four stars because I like how it feels. I don t feel like I have a heavy protectant cream on my face nor does it feel like a sticky gel  just fresh and clean. I will continue to use it but not sure I d buy a bottle myself. I received mine from Influenster for free for testing purposes.
6301,Michelle?Y.,0,20-Feb-19,,This product was very jelly. It felt nice when it was first on your skin but it never hydrated. I have a combination of dry and oily skin. This also burned a lot on my skin!
6302,Lia,1,11-Jun-17,,This is actually like a gel  i love the texture is very light and moisturizing. The price is actually great Walmart and Target has it for about 20-22 .
6303,MZLYNNY,1,06-Nov-18,,Great moisturizer! Absorbs quickly.
6304,Jess,1,10-Mar-15,,This gel is light weight on the skin  quickly absorbed and has long lasting effects. I wish I would have found this is the dead of winter because I really could have used the extra hydro boost then. I ve been using this in my nightly routine about 2-3 times a week and can see and feel a difference in the morning. I particularly can see a difference in my under eye area which is almost plumped after using this. Fine lines remain but overall my skin feels extra hydrated and soft. I m surprised how long this feeling remains even after going without a two nights in a row. The gel is cooling and refreshing when applied.
6305,Lindsey,1,28-Jan-18,,Pair this with a vit c serum and you get firm dewy skin!
6306,elvera,1,20-Feb-15,,One word AMAZING! I have a really hard time with most creams because they are usually too greasy and I hate grease on my face especially if I am putting on makeup in the morning and at night I feel like if the cream is greasy it will come off on my pillow and cause a big mess. Most creams don t completely absorb  but this one is completely different. Its so cool and refreshing when it comes on and the smell is just amazing. Absorbs within seconds and lasts all day. Best cream I have ever tried  and I have tried many  expensive ones and none come close to this one.
6307,Elise Tucker,1,03-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,My face hasn’t been this clear in years! I had been struggling for so long to find a moisturizer that would help my rosacea and clear up my acne and this has done both! My skin is so much smoother since I have started using this product.
6308,Heather Nelson,1,12-Mar-15,,I m in love with this product! I ve tried a million different moisturizers for my combination skin  but nothing has helped without breaking me out  until now. Because this product is water based it s very light &  airy  as opposed to thick & greasy like most moisturizers. After the first application  I immediately started seeing results. My skin was instantly softer & I was even able to put liquid foundation over it without a breakout. Thank you  Neutrogena! ð???  *I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost free for Influenster*
6309,maine2florida,1,24-Aug-18,,Nice feel and skin is smooth in the morning.
6310,Rachel Pierre,1,06-Mar-15,,I also received this product for free through my relationship with Influentster  all opinions are my own. Although I got this as a free trial  I will honestly say that this product is quite nice. The only cons are that it is a little pricey for me and not very thick for the winter months. However  the silky feel of the water gel is so refreshing! I love that it has a nice calming smell so I ve been using it at night after I wash my face. I wake up with smooth skin and I can then use my regular moisturizer with spf in the morning. However going to sleep with this calm smell has been really nice.
6311,Heather Morissette,1,29-Mar-15,3 people found this helpful,I am so happy that I got a chance to try out Neutrogena s HydroBoost water gel! (Complimentary from Influenster for review purposes)?  Otherwise  I probably wouldn t have tried it on my own.? I noticed a difference after the first use! My skin felt super soft and hydrated (which has been nice  since I m in the process of repairing my hair and skin from Winter Damage).?  One of my favorite parts of the water gel  is the natural/healthy glow (or  dewy  look) that I m noticing.  It was a very easy change in my Skincare routine too. After I wash my face  I apply my Vitamin C Serum  Toner  then Neutrogena s Hydro Boost Water Gel! (Side note: I have beyond sensitive skin  and I have no issues while using this product)
6312,CJT,1,06-May-17,,Ordering my second bottle! This stuff is amazing for my oily/dry skin! I can see a huge difference! My face has gotten so much smoother and soft! It feels so good on my skin and I love it! I will keep buying this!
6313,Heather,1,15-May-16,,I have been looking for a less expensive moisturizer to replace the Clinique Moisture Surge  and this is the best one I ve found! I may even go as far as to say that I like this even more. I love the scent  and how it feels going on. It absorbs quickly and is non greasy. Love .
6314,2 Many Paths,1,12-Jun-18,,The best .. does what it says!
6315,Danielle Cavazzini,1,03-Mar-15,,I love using this Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel! After I wash my face at night and pat my face dry  I use this water gel product on my skin. It feels amazing on my face. It dries pretty quickly and leaves my face feeling hydrated without being or feeling oily! (It smells great too and is not overwhelming). For the rest of the night my face feels smooth and healthy. I definitely recommend trying this product  I don t think anyone would regret using it. I used this product for free but it has no bearing on my review of the product.
6316,Shrums Owen,1,21-Apr-19,,I have to say this is a great product  but one has to spent around 20 bucks for just 1.7 oz. (Approx 1.5 month for me)
6317,Masha,1,03-Mar-15,,I love this stuff!!!! I have really oily skin but In the winter time it gets dry in certain spots!!! I needed something that would moisturize my skin but wouldn t make it oily like every other moisturizer I have used!!!! This stuff is great! My skin feels baby soft after I use it as well! I cannot wait to go out and buy the eye cream to this line!!! I did get Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free  but all opinions are my own!
6318,Lydia F.,1,28-Jul-16,,I seriously love this stuff. I hate lotion and this stuff is like silk. You only need a tiny bit. It goes a long way and dries almost immediately. Worth the money.
6319,N. J. Black,1,05-Mar-17,,Excellent  feel and makes my skin feel so good. It is soothing and helps moisturize without feeling sticky or greasy.
6320,Christie,1,04-Mar-18,,Winter in Minnesota is hard on my skin  but my skin is oily so finding a moisterizer that wasn t oily but quenched the thirst was great. Its not good for sensitive skin but if you don t have sensitive skin then it works just fine ????
6321,Priya Bajaj,0,22-Feb-18,2 people found this helpful,Broke my skin out and clogged my pores.
6322,megs,1,19-Mar-15,,Recently  I was given the Neutrogena Hydroboost Water Gel to try out and review. I actually really like the product for a couple reasons  and not just because it was free:  First of all  this really does feel like water. It glides on smoothly and gives my face a cool burst. It is really light-weight and doesn’t sit on top of my face like a lot of night creams. My face feels like I just splashed water on it and does a really great job of absorbing into my skin and leaving it feeling hydrated. This contains Hyaluronic Acid  which helps increase smoothness and decrease wrinkles. Woohoo! And it’s oil-free  so your skin isn’t left with that sticky feeling.  A little bit does go a long way  so I think I could use this product for months before having to buy it again. After a week of using this Hydroboost Gel  my skin does appear smoother and has a glow to it. Having dry skin makes it hard for me to find a product that helps with flaking and Neutrogena really did a great job with this product.  If you’re out of your current cream or looking to try something new for your nighttime routine  I definitely recommend trying this out!  I tested this product out for free  but all opinions are my own :)
6323,Emma Basilone,1,06-Mar-15,,I was nervous about this product when I first received it from Influenster  but it has quickly become a favorite. The gel leaves my face smooth without being tacky and allows me to move on with my makeup unlike other moisturizers that require drying time. My skin looks and feels softer.  I am so happy I have this and a little goes a long way so it will last a long time!  I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free  but all opinions are my own.
6324,RPK,1,01-Nov-17,,Love it!
6325,Alexandra Reisner,1,15-Mar-15,,This moisturizer reminds me of one of my former favorites: Clinique Moisture Surge. It s a similar light  water-based formula with a similar texture and feel (but it s blue rather than pink -- to differentiate more than anything?). It absorbs incredibly quickly and doesn t feel heavy  sticky  or greasy on my face. When I wanted a light moisturizer that wouldn t bring on a breakout (which is to say  when I was in college)  this is just the kind of product I chose. Now that I am a little older and have wrinkles to worry about  I prefer something a little more intense and nourishing. Still  for young skin  for summer  and for alternating with a richer cream  this gel formula does the trick. Please note: I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free from Influenster  but all opinions are my own.
6326,Cheryl Radtke,1,26-Oct-18,,Product felt so good. Immediate feeling of being hydrated. Love this product.
6327,B5mami#1,1,05-Mar-15,,I am loving this gel... I normally don t use moisturizers in my face since I have combination skin.. But when I was sent this product via influenster.com to review  I immediately was impressed... My skin feels supple but not oil. It s water based which means of you have oily skin you re not using more oil to moisturize.. I am loving this product. This product was sent to me by influenster.com to review.. But the opinions are true and honest.
6328,Casey L. Haubner,1,28-Feb-15,,I have combination oily/dry skin. Mainly oily with a few dry spots. After washing my face before bed I use the Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel. My skin felt replenished and refreshed. It didn t feel greasy or too heavy. I will definitely use this product again. It will be perfect for the summer when it gets hot and humid. Perfect moisturizer not too heavy.  I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free  but all of my opinions are my own.
6329,Customer,1,17-Mar-18,,I have been using Hydro Boost products for only a few weeks but notice a considerable improvement in my skin...definitely improved hydration and overall appearance! I love this product!
6330,Ariel,1,15-Apr-18,,Very good product. I use this all the time and I love the smell.
6331,Denise Bustamante,1,06-Mar-15,,I ve want to try this product since I first saw it on store shelves. I was very excited to try it when I received it as a sample compliments of Influenster. I absolutely loved it. I loved the way it instantaneously hydrated my skin. It is a great and cheaper solution for these cold winter days. It has been a great addition to my face routine and I wouldn t trade it for anything. Loving this product. Thank you neutrogena and influenster.
6332,Rebecca N,1,29-Jun-19,,This is the best cream for ultra dry skin You look st least 10 years younger It absorbs well and keeps your face hydrated all day Love this cream!??????
6333,KSimmons,1,03-Mar-15,8 people found this helpful,I live in Colorado and I swim quiet frequently in an indoor pool here... needless to say my skin is DRY and ITCHY a lot of the time. This has been the best thing I have used on my face/neck for this problem to date. I don t feel oily or that I m hurting my skin with this product at all. I love it  plus it s made my skin look better!  I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free  but all opinions are your own.
6334,Laura Ornelas,0,26-Feb-19,,En mi opini?n no me agrad? ya que al usarla me provoco acn?  la primer vez que la use no pasaron ni tres horas cuando ya ten?a brotes
6335,Amazon Customer,1,06-Nov-17,,I m not saying this stuff is magic  but I am saying that in the three months I ve been using it I ve been asked which high school I go to twice. I m 28 years old and will definitely continue to use it!
6336,Sarah Scroggins,1,12-Mar-15,6 people found this helpful,I absolutely love this product! At first the look and texture was unexpected but I love the color and feel of it. It instantly moisturizes your skin and you can see the moisture immediately. The directions say to use on your face and neck but I have been using it on my arms as well.  I m testing this product thanks to Influenster.
6337,Amazon Customer,1,25-Feb-15,,I got this to try free from influenster and im so glad I did. These winter months have been harsh on my skin and just after several uses my skin is feeling better. Its such a refreshed hydrated feeling honestly I dont thing my skin has ever felt this great. I was looking to get into a good skincare regimen and this is absolutely perfect im glad I got this!
6338,Heather :),1,13-Mar-15,One person found this helpful,I was able to test this product for free. The first night I used it after washing my face before bed. I really liked the way it felt on my skin. I continued to use it everyday instead of my oil based moisturizer. By day 3 I could see that thyou product was not strong enough for my skin. I would apply it and a few minutes later I could see that my face was still dry.  While I did like the product at first  it wasn t enough for me. I might try it in the summertime when my skin is not as dry as it is in the winter. I think it would work great on someone with normal or oily skin. But not people with dry skin.
6339,Amazon Customer,0,08-Mar-19,,Did not purchase... wondering why they felt it necessary to include Blue dye in their product...?! Disappointed.
6340,SydGrif,1,30-Nov-17,,It s amazing. my skin is smooth and it s not as dry as it was before. I would recommend you get the cleanser as well  Between the two you will see an improvement in your skin.
6341,Laura,1,18-Mar-15,,I have always been a fan of Neutrogena products and this hydro gel is no exception. I really like the way it smells and the way it is absorbed by my skin. I do feel that in particularly dry areas (i.e. my nose) it is not as effective. However that being said  the more I use it the more it tends to be working! My favorite things about the hydro gel is how quickly I can apply my makeup afterwards. My only wish is that it contained some SPF in it. My makeup does  but for products used on my face my attitude toward SPF is the more the merrier! I would purchase this product in the future. I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost for free but all opinions are 100% my own.
6342,Amazon Customer,1,30-Apr-17,,This is my favorite moisturizer ever! I have tried so many  from drugstore to high end  but this is perfect for oily/combo skin. Provides great moisture and doesn t break me out! Will repurchase over and over
6343,UncleD,1,19-Mar-19,,This is the best facial cream  non greasy  rubs in smooth and moisturizes face all day. Highly recommended!
6344,LABride,1,12-Mar-15,,I normally feel like I need an actual cream to do the job  but I have to say this stuff is amazing. I started using it after I had my baby and my skin was looking dull and gray. A week and a half later I look like my self again and my skin isn t dry at all. I ve even been using this instead of my night cream.
6345,Maia,1,03-Mar-15,,Just started using this water gel but so far I really love it! It makes my normally extremely dry skin feel so soft and moisturized without making me break out! The texture is a bit weird at first and feels like it s going to drip off your fingers  but you get used to it after a few uses. Definitely recommend it to anyone else with chronically dry and sensitive skin like mine.
6346,M. T.Pope,1,07-Dec-14,,Very Light and hydrating to the skin. Love that its not sticky. A nice pleasant scent. I would recommend this product to others
6347,Amazon Customer,1,04-Dec-17,,Haven’t used this but heard good it’s a good light moisturizer. Just wanted those with sensitive skin like me that fragrance can often cause breakouts.
6348,Amber Foddrill,1,30-Mar-15,,I have been using this product once a day for about a month now. It does a great job with keeping my skin hydrated and soft. On days where I don t feel like wearing makeup  I will just splash water on my face and neck  pat lightly with a towel  then apply this gel  then a moisture cream for a clean  natural look. Drawback is it s a tad expensive for a drugstore brand  but I will definitely buy some once I use mine up. It doesn t leave a sticky feeling  can t detect any odor  and seems to be absorbed quickly  even on top of makeup. My skin has definitely improved from using this product. I was lucky enough to be able to try Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free  but all opinions are my own.
6349,Stefanie Boyko,1,25-Feb-15,,I recently received this product and tested it for free and I will definitely be buying it when my first jar runs out! It smells fantastic and really made my face feel moisturized and refreshed. It did this without feeling greasy or heavy  which is always a concern of mine. The only downside is that it is going to run out fast because my husband loves it too!
6350,Holly,1,22-Mar-15,,I have always loved neutrogena products especially for winter because my face completely dries out and is gross. This gel definitely helped rehydrate my skin so that it wasn t so scaly! I use it mostly before bed and in the morning. I was lucky enough to test it for free and I m glad because I would definitely buy it again!
6351,Amazon Customer,1,09-Jul-16,,ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS STUFF! I NEVER wear moisturizer. It always makes me breakout. In 30 years of buying (and tossing) moisturizers  this is the first product I can wear daily that does not make my face revolt. It is light  quick to absorb  and actually moisturizes my dry skin. Fragrance is not noticeable. My 18year old daughter  who has oily skin  also loves it for the same reason  it does not make her break out. together we are on our 3rd jar.
6352,Laura Kinson,1,11-Mar-15,,I thought this was going to be much heavier/dense. I was delighted when it should up and really felt like water on my skin! Hydro boost is definitely an appropriate name!  My only complaint is that I think it made me break out on the first couple days of using it  but I m hoping that goes away with time.
6353,Audra Kommer,1,08-Mar-15,,I absolutely love the neutrogena hydro boost water gel! My skin feels so soft and hydrated after using it. I like that it isn t greasy and it is so light. This is the perfect product for the harsh winter we have had this year. Thanks to Influenster I was able to try it out for free and I definitely plan to continue to purchase it.
6354,LB,0,26-Dec-18,,The fragrance was too strong for me.
6355,kurt,1,12-Dec-15,,Works great
6356,ABP,0,17-Mar-15,7 people found this helpful,First off  I received this free as part of a trial. Second  it may make your face soft  but it takes chemically created ingredients to do it. It burned my face and eyes about 5 minutes after applying and I barely got close to the orbital bone  then after about 30 minutes I simply had to wash it off because the overly pungent fragrance made me sick to my stomach and is not at all necessary. I love the concept  I do  but I m not going to put God knows what on my face to get there. I threw it away  I wouldn t even give this full jar to friends or family.
6357,Rebecca Brackin,1,14-Mar-15,,After receiving this product for sampling by Influenster I was excited to try it! I have been using it for almost a month and i can honestly say i love this stuff! I takes just a tiny bit and it smells great! I feel refreshed and hydrated! I love that this is not oil based but rather water based! Thank you influenster. It does not help my with redness
6358,Bill S,1,09-Dec-17,,This lotion is amazing and really makes my skin feel so smooth!
6359,Tabitha Bowen,1,27-Feb-15,,I ve been looking for something to help my dry skin on my face and I ve found it! This is one of the best products I ve ever used. I put it on before bed and my skin stays soft throughout the next day. Even the smell of this is good! I will be buying again!
6360,L. Thompson,1,18-Mar-15,,I recently received this to try. I normally have dry skin due to facial cleansers  been on a search to find a facial moisturizer that doesn t leave my skin shiny/oily. I was pleasantly surprised by this product  my skin is close to matte with this product. The fragrance is a bit strong  could do without the fragrance  but it s not overpowering. A little goes a long way! Doesn t interfere with my makeup routine  can apply make up right after application without my face feeling weighed down. Will purchase in the future!
6361,Lindsey Child,1,15-Mar-15,2 people found this helpful,It s light and keeps your face smoothe. My hubby noticed the glow it left after a few days. It took me a whole week before I saw it in my own face. :) the smell is amazing! I puteam on my face every morning before applying makeup and after washing my face before bed. And I didn t feel like it would make my face super greasy. I also LOVED using it after a cleansing mask once a week :)
6362,Cynthia Delgado,1,09-Mar-15,,I have been using it for a little over a week and I love it so far. I usually apply it in the mornings right after I shower when my skin feels dry the most and works amazing. I immediately feel the difference and hydrates my face immediately without making oily.
6363,alexandria Bozen,1,19-Apr-16,,Overall  after about a month of using the hydro boost water gel  my skin has become dramatically brighter and smooth. It is the perfect moisturizer for summer due to its light-weight feel and quick drying after application. I would almost describe my skin after applying this gel as looking  matte  with a reduced visibility of my pores. Plans are to continue use due to its positive impact on my skin  and wallet as well!
6364,Misty Kammerer,1,07-Mar-15,,I am loving this product! Usually around this time of year my skin is very dry from the Cincinnati weather. This product has kept my product clean  fresh & moisturised.  This product was given to me to test by Influenster
6365,Annie Ames,1,01-Mar-15,,I just received this product from Neutrogena via Influenster free of charge to test and I have to admit  it s actually pretty amazing. It feels cool once I put it on my face and doesn t feel oily. Definitely loving so far!
6366,George,1,01-Jul-16,,I used to have oily and kp ridden skin that was acne prone now my skin is super smooth when I use this.
6367,meghan cole,1,05-Mar-15,,Love the way this hydrates ! Best moisturizer I have found this Clinique s dramaticly differnt moisturizing lotion! No oily feeling face since its water based! Definitely worth the price!

6370,Bronwyn,1,12-Dec-14,32 people found this helpful,I have had nothing but great experiences with Neutrogena products  and this one is no exception. I have been using this product  day and night  for over a week and it has been doing a great job with my dry winter skin. I personally despise the oily goopy texture of oil based products  and so I love this water  gel  and the slight tingle that I get when I put it on my skin. There is a light fragrance  but definitely not overpowering.  The only thing I would tell people to watch out for  is that it has a very runny consistency  so a little goes a long way. Also the jar is very slippery and heavy for its size so if it falls out of your hand  it s easier for the contents to get spilled :/
6371,Kari N.,0,11-Mar-16,4 people found this helpful,I tried this on my sensitive skin and immediately broke out into a hot  itchy rash. Washed my face  tried again the next day  same result. Started using it on the driest parts of my body (elbows  heels) and while this did absorb nicely  it made absolutely no difference to my dry flakey skin in those areas.
6372,daisy,1,01-Mar-15,,This product is so awesome for my skin..my skin feels refreshed every time I use it.. it drys up quick and it has a good smell to it.. #BehindTheGlow
6373,cgows,1,13-Mar-15,,This moisturizer is super versatile - I love that I can put it on at night and get great hydration before bed  but also wear it during the underneath my makeup! The best part though is the texture of your skin after applying it. This made my skin feel incredibly soft! I ll definitely be getting this again!
6374,Megan O Briant,1,28-Feb-15,,goes on smooth and makes skin feel nice. I got this free to try from influenster and I have to say its one of my favorite things they sent me
6375,Neal Moorhouse,1,13-Mar-15,,I really like this lotion from Neutrogena. It goes on light and gives you a fresh feeling.
6376,Lacy Pulis,1,15-Mar-15,,I have been trying the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel for free for the last week! My opinion of the moisturizer- you can instantly feel the moisture soak in to your skin. I use it twice a day and it has replaced my moisturizer & serum combo I was using. So happy to find something that puts moisture where needed without feeling oily!
6377,Rosalyn Mills,1,13-Mar-15,,I received it as a tester item from Influenster. Since it is winter time  my skin gets a little dry. I ve been using the hydro boost water gel and it has been wonderful. My skin feels really good.
6378,Anna Dapelo-Garcia,1,24-Mar-15,,Great product! In addition to having an oily t-zone  I have normal to dry skin everywhere else. However with Hydro Boost  my skin seems to even out all-over and is very soft. I love it!
6379,Alexandra,1,13-Mar-15,,Received this to try out and I must say it s amazing. Never had a moisturizer quite like this it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I would recommend to anyone.
6380,Valoree James,1,19-Mar-15,,Love this stuff! Very hydrating  but not greasy. Smells great too! Wish it had a sunscreen. But other than that  I m very satisfied!
6381,S. Wilson,1,26-Mar-15,,Great night-time moisturizer for when your skin is super dry. Feels great  smells great  works instantly. A bit on the expensive side  but it works really well.
6382,JRam,1,04-Aug-17,55 people found this helpful,I LOVE this stuff!! I have reallly oily skin and would wash my face in the am/pm and put face lotion for oily skin but still noticed i would still get oily. Heard about gel moisturizers and found this! I dip 1 finger in and it is enough for my whole face. Woke up late and left without washing my face in the AM and I was still not as oily as I am when I do wash it...not even half! My face feels hydrated  soft and smooth! Does not feel sticky  very light wieght and absorbs quickly. Out of habit i felt like applying more because i was used to rubbing lotion in but you really do not need to.
6383,Emily,1,23-Nov-16,86 people found this helpful,I tend to be prone to breakouts if I use any product daily on my face  but I ve been needing a good moisturizer because I m 29 and have not consistently used a moisturizer and I m worried my age is starting to show. Anyway  saw commercials for this on TV and made a note to try it. Paid somewhere in the rage of $20 at Walmart for it. It smells really nice and fresh and is a thin gel that goes on very smooth without any residue. My skin really soaks this stuff up and it seems to do a great job without irritating my skin or causing breakouts. In fact I would say that this has helped to clear my skin and has faded (slightly  nothing crazy...this stuff isn t magic ;-) some of the red marks I have from old pimples. I have rather oily/combo skin and this works great for me and I would recommend!
6384,PDXLee,1,04-Feb-18,25 people found this helpful,I LOVE this stuff. It s been a dry PacNW winter - this is a great way to get moisture to your skin. I don t love that it s in a jar - dipping my fingers in can t be as sanitary as a pump.... But the hydration factor outweighs the ick. After using this for about a week  the dry flaky patches I had on my cheeks went away. I ve tried an off-brand hyaluronic serum... not nearly as good as this.
6385,notthebestreviewer,1,11-Dec-17,17 people found this helpful,I needed a replacement for Proactiv s Green Tea Moisturizer  which is incredible but also incredibly pricey. I m not a big fan of cream based moisturizers. They don t go on smoothly and make my face feel clammy. Figured I would try this  and it s all right. I don t get the same refreshing feel afterwards  and my face still feels kind of  rough  putting it on and even after. I might try the stronger version of this.  Update: From 4-stars to 5-stars.  I guess I needed some time to adjust to the new moisturizer because after about a week it left a much better feeling on my face than what it had before. I m still going to try the stronger version of this because I do winter cycling commutes to work and back and my eyes can get dry skin around them and I m hoping the stronger version will fix that. As long as you re not winter cycling on a regular/frequent basis  or doing something similar with freezing temperatures and winds  I would highly recommend this!
6386,Gina G.,1,13-May-18,9 people found this helpful,This is easily the best face moisturizer I’ve ever used. I’ve tried so many. I used to have dry spots of skin on my face every morning. I tried a number of Olay moisturizers and then turned to some more expensive products. I saw an add for this in an Allure magazine and tried it on a whim. This is one of the first times I ever tried something from an advertisement. It’s fantastic. The gel moisturizer sinks into skin immediately. I’ve tried other gel moisturizers as well but this is easily the best. One morning application feels fantastic and cooling and lasts all day  however you can definitely apply again throughout the day if necessary... although it never really is needed. Highly recommended!
6387,Lexy K.,1,10-Oct-18,7 people found this helpful,If you ve read any of my other reviews  you know I m basically president of the Grease Face Club. If I can make it to lunch without my nose becoming an actual mirror  I m good. Over the years  I ve tried so many different types of products from all different companies and product lines  I ve completely lost count.  Keeping this nice and simple  this is the one morning  lotion  that I ve found and used that just works. It s light  cool-feeling  not sticky  leaves no residue  dries smoothly  and has a soft scent. I use thicker  more moisture-retaining products and moisturizers at nighttime  but this is the one and only morning product that I have come to trust and love. If you re looking for a water-based product to use that won t add to your grease-production  trust me and give this one a try!  If my review has helped you in any way  please let me know  or hit  Yes  under this review. Thank you! :)
6388,Divita s Mom,1,02-Feb-18,10 people found this helpful,Feels amazing when you put it on  but I have very dry skin and I m not sure I m getting a lot of moisture. Either way  it feels and smells sooooo good. I put it all over my neck and decolletage for firmer skin and I can see the difference.
6389,LizzieLizard,1,06-Jan-19,4 people found this helpful,Ok  disclaimer: I was on Absorica (still isotretinoin but not quite as strong as the brand Accutane  which was discontinued in the U.S.). I was on it for 8 months  and the last 3 months I was at the max of 80mg for my body weight. This stuff combined with their serum saved my skin  no joke. I was told that my skin would peel and flake like crazy  and since I ve done a lot of chemical peels and laser treatments in the past  I was bummed because I know my skin peels A LOT. I put this gel on every morning before applying my makeup (it absorbs very quickly) and used the serum most nights in the beginning (I didn t use it as much after the halfway mark because my skin was plenty hydrated from this and the hydrating (blue) micellar water I used to take off my makeup at night). I didn t peel or flake at all  and my skin feels baby soft! And I m talking softer than before I began Accutane  which is crazy because it s like the most drying medication you can take. I will continue using this post-Accutane because who wouldn t want great  healthy skin every day? And it s non-comedogenic for those of you worried about it breaking you out. A LOT of the expensive brands of face moisturizers contain comedogenic ingredients that will clog your pores and cause breakouts if you re acne-prone (I did a lot of scrolling through ingredient lists lol). This one seems pricey  but it s worth every penny and lasts about 6-7 months with daily use! Just please give it a try! If you re really worried about dry skin  maybe try their extra-dry formula.
6390,edward,1,21-Jun-17,12 people found this helpful,Hydrated my face from the first second I put it on! I am a man and would have never thought I would buy this or even write a review. I live close to the beach and spend my time outside which drys my face! This seems to be an amazing solution!
6391,Serena,0,03-May-18,7 people found this helpful,I didn’t care for this cream AT ALL! I used the night cream and eye cream from neutropenia and loved it but this cream was a waste  personally. I would put it on in the evening before bed and 20-30 later I would notice dry spots on my face when I had moisturized. So I reapplied it  same thing. I tried using it in the am before putting make up on and again before bed. Still had patches of dry skin. I would highly recommend sticking with the night cream over this product. Not satisfied at all.
6392,ShoopC1,1,15-Jan-19,3 people found this helpful,I ve been an avid Arbonne user for over 10 years but have found that they ve changed the formulations and it s no longer working as well for my skin. Before venturing out on another expensive skin care line  I decided to try the Hydro Boost line. I ve only been using it for about a week and I can already tell a difference in my skin. I tend to have combination skin so I was a bit worried that this might be too much moisture but it s not- AT ALL. My skin feels soft and clean all day long. It absorbs quickly and feels amazing. My forehead is no longer greasy by late afternoon. This is an amazing product and an even more amazing price! After spending 4X the price of this for years  I m so excited to have found something that works so well for such an awesome price! Don t hesitate to try this!
6393,Elle F.,1,29-Jan-19,3 people found this helpful,I have oily skin and am prone to acne. While I have found a cleanser that works well for my skin  I ve had trouble finding a good moisturizer. Everything I ve tried either adds more oil to my already oily face or dries it out completely. I read about water based/gel moisturizers and Hydro Boost kept coming up. I bought it two weeks ago and I don t think I m ever going to use another moisturizer ever again.  My face finally feels clean and  balanced . It doesn t get too oily or too dry. I haven t had flakey skin around my eyes (I live in the desert where the air is always so dry). And a little goes a long way! I use less than a quarter-sized amount and it covers my whole face and neck area.
6394,Wylie Emma Bird,1,29-Nov-18,2 people found this helpful,Hallelujah  this face gel is shaping up to be my new favorite A+ moisturizer. I have an incredibly oily T-zone  and it s always been just something that I ve lived with. I ve finally decided to start hunting around for products that could help me control that. This is about attempt four. I m used to using an incredibly rich moisturizer that felt great on my skin but left it looking like an oil slick  so I wanted something that still felt good  just... helped with the oil slick issue. I think this one is it.  What exactly I ve been noticing here is that my skin absorbs this very quickly and it leaves behind a finish that feels a bit soft and powdery. My forehead is dramatically less shiny at the end of the day  and I m not noticing any dry or flaky spots indicting lack of hydration in my non-problem areas. I ve been using it for a couple of weeks now  and have yet to have any issues with breakouts or discomfort. There is a mild tingling/cooling sensation upon application  but it hasn t bothered my skin  and I m fairly sensitive  and it fades quickly.  There are just two things that aren t to my taste  and they re minor: I d rather this gel came in a tube instead of a jar  for general convenience and hygiene; and it would be fantastic if the gel was as unscented as some of of the Hydro Boost products. Still  the slight perfume is reasonably neutral  hasn t irritated me yet  and doesn t linger. None of this will stop me from repurchasing.  In my couple weeks  use  once daily  I ve barely made a dent in the jar. I suspect it will be three months before I need to reorder.  I combine this gel with the Neutrogena Hydro Boost sunscreen in my morning application  and dust my face with a shin-control powder; no other make-up. I think my skin looks matte and healthy for most of the day.
6395,E. Johnson,0,18-Feb-19,3 people found this helpful,This has a chemical smell masked by an awful scent. I put it on my cheeks where my skin is the driest and the scent was so overwhelming it stung my eyes and stung my sinuses . I only used the smallest little dab on each cheek . I guess I m just too chemical sensitive . On the pros the color is lovely and the consistency nice   it went on very smoothly and soaked into my skin very well . However   I don t recommend this product if you are sensitive to chemicals .
6396,Kalee Lukawitz,0,18-May-18,5 people found this helpful,I had pretty high hopes but i think it was more my own fault. My skin is on the more sensitive side and Neutrogena products ALWAYS make my face break out. For the first day of using it my face felt softer but by the second/third day I got a really bad break out and its taken about two weeks for my face to heal and even now my face still has pimples. Btw I wasn t wearing makeup and my routine didn t change much besides this moisturizer when the breakout happened.
6397,Lauren,0,26-Nov-17,3 people found this helpful,I used this for about a month until I realized it was what was making me break out horribly. It was painful acne covering my entire face. I stopped using it and within a couple days my skin was starting to heal. I do not have sensitive skin and I have never had a reaction like this. This moisturizer has a strong scent  so I m sure there is something in that does not mix well with your skin. I also noticed that I would use it and still be left with large dry patches of skin. Frustrated that I spent $13 on this product and cannot return it but now I know. I would recommend trying to get your hands on a free sample before spending the money and maybe test patch it.
6398,Cherisse,0,02-Mar-19,2 people found this helpful,Ripped packaging got me DISAPPOINTED but no seal and unfilled product had me SUSPICIOUS.

Before buying  I advise you to read all the 1 star reviews and take the photos of people whose skin have had adverse reactions seriously. I will definitely be returning!
6399,rachel l.j.,1,14-Aug-17,6 people found this helpful,I ve used many moisturizers for my combination  acne prone skin but I am really loving this one.

6400,Ell Rae,0,16-Feb-18,5 people found this helpful,Not at all what I thought it was. The gel burned my skin and made me break out in ugly red rashes. They are so painful. It absorbed into my skin so fast that it left it feeling chalky and tight.  I m not happy with this and I don t recommend it.
6401,Diana Dewolf,1,02-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,It feels just like water going on your face but it stays and soaks IN and that s what I like about this. You can start your day not  greasing up  but your skins gets the  drink  it desperately needs in a dry climate when you first wake up. This sure beats sloshing tap water on your face (tap water  moisture  immeditately vanishes and your skin goes dry again). Then I follow with moisturizer/sunscreen and then put on my foundation makeup. It does make a diffference. While not as heavy as a serum  it helps similar to a serum under your moisturizer and make up.
6402,Frequent Buyer Located in The Beach Cities of South Orange County  CA,1,19-Jul-17,5 people found this helpful,Excellent Product. I have purchase it several times and will continue to purchase it. It is the newest rage in SKIN CARE products. I highly recommend this product and the eye boost gel too. And BECAUSE these 2 items are shipped and sold by Amazon  they actually showed up. That is akin to a miracle.
6403,CLH,1,16-May-19,One person found this helpful,I personally find this moisturizer to be the lightest  cleanest feeling  and pleasant scented of any on market. In fact  it is very different from any of the others because it is water based and feels so much different than any of the creams. And it works really unbelievably with results in a few days. No more dry skin around nose or forehead and under eyes actually glow with smoothness. I can’t say enough about this product ( recommended by my Dermatologist) ! And the price is actually low for the highest of quality!
6404,Brandie L. Woods,1,26-Feb-18,3 people found this helpful,For the past few years  I have tried lotions and creams on my face because I am getting older. I had very few wrinkles (if any) when I was in my early 50 s) but  now my skin had becaome so dry and creepy looking that I decided to give this a try and it seems to be doing the job! Rarely do you see a real product that can work on older skin  but this DOES work and I will continue to use this product from now on! And  it doesn t break the bank!!
6405,Kishna P.,0,16-Jan-18,5 people found this helpful,I didn t like anything about this product other than the fact that it smells nice. It is definitely not made for dry skin because it is gel-based. Also  the consistency gets more liquidy in the container as time goes by. It doesn t provide moisture for more than 2-3 hours. Do not recommend this product to anyone suffering from dry skin.
6406,Cariann,1,23-Aug-17,6 people found this helpful,Have only been using this moisturizer for a few days  but so far so good. I like it  I have conbination/oily skin and it doesn t leave my face greasy. It has a light consistency  which I love!
6407,LORIE FLAKS,0,20-Mar-19,2 people found this helpful,I have many allergies and sensitive skin. I was overjoyed when after years of looking for something I could use  I found this product. I have been using it for about two years. The last jar I ordered now comes with fragrance in it. So not only was it a waste of almost $20 - but now I need to search for a new product. So disappointed - not only that I have to search again but that they changed it without advertising
6408,beecakes,1,05-Feb-17,5 people found this helpful,To me this product is very hydrating! I ve bought many so called  hydrating  gels/creams  they don t work I was expecting the same with this product. But when I used the water gel it was hydrating not oily and it goes a long way! Plus the smell of it was the best part! It smells clean and like a spa. When ever the price goes down I wanna buy this again!!
6409,Cher G.,0,28-Apr-18,4 people found this helpful,Thought it would be good for my face with hydration but instead I just break out each time I used it only used it twice. Won t buy again. Face is very sensitive and this product don t help. Really don t feel or look hydrated.
6410,Chris,1,10-Apr-18,2 people found this helpful,I really like the smell and the way it feels on my skin. It just soaks right into the skin without any greasy film or stickiness. I m using an acne cleanser that is really drying out my skin so I have to use Shea butter along with it right now  but once my skin clears up I think this will be a good daily moisturizer. The container is nice and I like the way it looks  like it s a high end product lol
6411,Sumrii,1,23-Dec-17,3 people found this helpful,This hydrates really well. Spreads into the skin easily and does a good job of curbing dryness. Does smell heavily fragranced however  so if you are sensitive to scents or break out from products that are fragranced you might want to do a test first.
6412,Stace23,1,02-Sep-17,4 people found this helpful,LOVE LOVE LOVE this gel. Got a sample someplace  and have been hooked ever since. Feels SO good on my face  it honestly makes me happy when I put it on. Yes  I am a dork  but this stuff feels awesome  and I do think my skin looks better  but I am still ugly :)
6413,moveslikejagger,0,15-Jul-18,5 people found this helpful,Be warned  this is the version with fragrance and coloring. Not only is it overly perfume-like  but it’s irritating if you want or need a product without the fragrance and coloring that make so many people react. I love the other version but accidentally bought this and it made me react. The fragrance-free version is available on Amazon  too  just read carefully.
6414,F. Li,0,27-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,The site states this is allergen and dye free. I happen to be allergic to blue dye in cosmetic/skin care products and using this the first time my face burned. The only other time this happened was with another product containing blue dye. Shortly after I got hives and had to take an anti-histamine.  Looking at the other reviews and product ingredients this product seems to contain blue dye so be careful if you are allergic to it!
6415,April,1,16-May-19,One person found this helpful,I ve tried SO MANY types of moisturizers  and none of them did the trick. I have acne prone skin that s dry (go figure)  and I wear foundation. This is the BEST moisturizer I ve ever used! Not only is it actually hydrating  but it works well with all the foundations I use. It smells great  dries quickly  and keeps my skin hydrated under the makeup without causing shine.
6416,anntieem,1,02-Mar-19,,I love this face cream! Previously  I was using St. Ives  but if I used it too often  it would cause my forehead to break out. I have used this product every day for a month without any blemishes. My skin is soft and supple  and my forehead wrinkles have decreased significantly. I also highly recommend the hand lotion. It only took two applications to improve my dry  cracked hands. My friends said they could tell immediately.  While this isn t the cheapest skin product  you barely need to apply any of it to see results. Well worth the money. I would recommend this to anyone with dry  sensitive skin.
6417,MJR,1,12-May-19,,I was apprehensive about this because of the negative reviews. But take those reviews with a grain of salt. Like other products you’ve never used before  there is a chance of an allergic reaction  so be smart and check the ingredients. I already use Neutrogena so no break outs here. This is surprisingly light weight! And a little goes a long way  so you don’t need a whole lot. I just dip my middle finger in it until it touches my fingernail and that’s enough for my face and neck. The smell is pleasant also. I think this is my new go-to face moisturizer.
6418,Nivas,0,29-Aug-17,13 people found this helpful,I bought this product mainly for the hyaluronic acid content. When I checked the ingredients list the hyaluronic acid is listed at the very end indicating that it does not have much of it to make a difference.  The product caused closed comodones on my face  so I discontinued use after 1 week.
6419,Tricia 1988,1,25-May-19,One person found this helpful,I love this gel moisturizer. I hate a heavy moisturizer that feels greasy. This gel leaves no greasy feeling and it leaves my skin soft and radiant. I have very sensitive skin and prone to breakouts. I have no problems with Neutrogena Hydro Boost. I love the scent and will continue to purchase it.
6420,Dk72922,1,24-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,I have combination skin  but this moisturizer seems to help balance things out. It is very lightweight and refreshing  and doesn’t make my skin greasy. I recently put this on a sunburn because I was out of aloe and this lotion has a cooling effect. I think it helped my sunburn heal faster... no peeling or itching! This reminds me of whatever they put into the Garnier moisture bomb facial mask... which I also recommend!
6421,Jen,1,03-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,I was not having issues with my old moisturizer  but I traveled with a friend who bullied me in to trying this product that she swore by. I have very sensitive skin so I was a little nervous  but I must say  it smooths on easily  is never greasy  feels great on my skin  and has really helped with some late-20s fine lines that I saw cropping up. It has also never irritated my skin in the slightest. I ve now been a faithful user for almost a year and haven t looked back!
6422,Molly Brown,1,28-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,I am undergoing chemo treatments and my skin is exceptionally dry plus I live in Colorado. This is the first moisturizer I have found that really works. Plus  it is a very reasonable price. I have tried much more expensive moisturizers with much less success. I will continue to use this from now on.
6423,Raven,0,19-Apr-19,,I was looking for a good moisturize for my naturaly oily skin. This moisturizer is so drying its ridiculous. The first thing I noticed was it s strong perfume scent that smells like soap and and its watery consistency. I was so disappointed with is product. I even tryed to add a little rose hip seed oil in in to see if it would help  but no  it did absolutely nothing. When It dried it LITERALLY felt like it sucked all the moisture out my skin.
6424,Ang,1,09-Jan-19,,I am always hesitant to spend money on face creams and moisturizers because they re never always as good as you hope they will be. I have sensitive skin and I hate fragrance in products  I do not notice any scent. I love this gel. I use it after washing my face and it is cooling and refreshing but does not leave any residue once it dries. My skin has not had any redness or dryness while using it. A little goes a long way too so I can stretch a jar for a few months.
6425,Amazon Customer,0,05-Jul-17,3 people found this helpful,At first trying it  it made my skin feel super soft once I had put it on. Then later I continued to use it and I broke out. I kept using it just for a bit more to get my skin used to it and it didn t. My face broke out and I guess it didn t like the product. Discontinued it and went back to my seaweed body shop. Put two stars because i received it quick and was boxed wonderfully
6426,James R.,1,20-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I ve been using this moisturizer for a few weeks now and I can t believe how much it s minimized my pores while plumping up my skin. I feel like it took years off (including sun damage). It has a really nice  clean smell and it s easy to apply/not sticky or oily. Highly recommended for anyone looking to have skin that looks and feels more youthful.
6427,Tyler Dietz,1,18-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,I have a combination of oily and dry  peeling skin and have been looking for a moisturizer that wouldn’t feel heavy and make me break out. Ordered this and I was definitely not disappointed! A little bit definitely goes a long way with this product! You get quite a bit of product for the price too. Simply just wash your face  pat dry  and then place some of this baby on and your skin will be left feeling hydrated and very soft. Works all day and haven’t had a single problem with it! Definitely is going to be my go to moisturizer now!
6428,lauri keane,0,06-Apr-18,3 people found this helpful,OMG... WHY the fragrance??? Smells so strongly of lilacs  it s nauseating. Seems to hydrate well  but too sticky to use under my powder mineral make up.
6429,Melissa Brage,1,01-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,This is the best face moisturizer in the history of drugstore facial moisturizers in all of creation  in my opinion. It doesn t leave my face feeling greasy  and I do not have that unsightly oily sheen the next morning when I wake up or blasting through my foundation the next day. The skin absorbs the gel  and it feels pretty great. I recommend it!
6430,Judy P.,1,31-Jan-18,7 people found this helpful,This the first time I ve used this product. It has a mild pleasant fragrance. It s feels soothingly cool to the touch  is not oily. I love the way it glides on smoothly  feels light on the skin and absorbs quickly  allowing me to put on my other products without having to wait a long time. This is especially helpful for those mornings when you don t have a lot of time. I would give this 5-stars  however I want to wait to see if I can see improvement in my skin with regular use. This product is definitely worth a try.
6431,Margaret,0,09-Apr-18,2 people found this helpful,I bought this as an alternative to Hado Labo Skin Plumping Gel. This is a far inferior product. It s really perfumey and broke my face out in cystic acne. And I don t believe it hydrated as well either. I will stick with Hado Labo.
6432,Thomas,1,11-Nov-17,2 people found this helpful,This is great  my skin has never felt better. It not only hydrate my skin  but its actually helping control my acne. This is perfect for dry or oily skin.
6433,opal,0,30-Mar-18,7 people found this helpful,The product I received was not Fragrance free or dye free as listed in the description. I had to wash this off with in minutes  the fragrance does not evaporate and made my eyes water. I so wanted to like this but product but I can not tolerate the fragrance more than a few minutes. I know Neutrogena makes a fragrance free version of this but this is not it. Hopefully Amazon can correct this incorrect listing. Also: This product is also not dye free  the jar is blue but so is the product inside.
6434,Anne,1,18-Oct-17,3 people found this helpful,Greatest moisturizer and plumper for face ever. Ever! Don’t rub on. Pat on entire face  under eyes and neck/chest. Something about formula makes it work better than just pure hyluronic acid.
6435,Jasmine,1,01-May-18,,the way I use this is i apply toner  essence  serum  then this as my last step to keep the moisture in that i just applied so im not basing this as just a stand alone moisturizer...theres definitely better out there but i just needed something to help keep my skin hydrated longer. It does have a fragrance so if you have sensitive skin this isnt for you sadly. I like this product but i wouldnt repurchase cause its not worth the money unless it starts paying my bills
6436,Elizabeth Rearick,1,29-Aug-18,,So light  so airy and works so well. I have very oily skin  but was recently put on prescription acne medication that dried my face up and made my skin peel until it hurt. My dermatologist recommended this over every other moisturizer on the market  and I am so happy she did. I use a TINY amount 2x a day and my skin has stopped peeling and feels like normal skin should  not greasy  but not dry. Dare I say - dewy!
6437,Abzeez,1,01-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I just used the last of this moisturizer  and love it. I think this one will definitely work better for me in the summer  as I have super dry skin  so I ordered the extra dry skin formula this time around.
6438,LV4NMLS,1,28-May-18,,I love the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream  but I don’t remember the scent being so strong the first time I used the product several months ago. It’s a strong sweet scent that almost makes me want to not use it  but I power through until it is completely absorbed into my skin  and then the offensive scent disappears. I love the texture and I feel like the product itself is quite effective in hydrating my face  so I’m on the fence with repurchasing it again.
6439,Gio Tovar,1,25-Jun-19,,I was looking for something that would moisturize my face but was afraid of the harmful chemicals. I have tried other creams and I regret very quickly. This cream is great. Is light  absorbs quickly  is not oily and does not irritate my skin. The plus   this great fragrance! And also I don’t need much of it  just a little dab will do. I totally recommend.
6440,AJT,1,26-Oct-16,4 people found this helpful,Excelllet hydrating gel. No brekaout . Very smooth and soft to the skin. I used it day and night after wash. My skin look very fresh. Not dry out anymore . Must better than those expensive cream that I bought at the mall that cost $200.
6441,Sandra M.,1,25-Feb-18,,This is my GO TO moisturizer! I am obsessed with how it makes my skin feels and how it smells (kinda like artificial blue raspberry or blue flavoring smell lol). It has made my skin so much softer and it lasts a really long time since a little goes a long way. I am almost done with this bottle and will definitely be re-ordering when I am close to running out.
6442,Jan,1,07-Mar-19,,This is a good product and it helps my skin feel smooth and moisturized. It has not helped with wrinkles  but it does what it is advertised. I’m happy with it. My problem is it simply does not go very far. It takes quite a bit of the product to fully cover face and neck  consequently  this jar of moisturizer does not last long.
6443,Haley,1,06-Jan-19,,I had heard lots of good things about this products and I needed something to give my skin a hydrating boost. I love that this gel stays cold and isn’t sticky when applying. It goes on smooth and really soaks into the skin. Unfortunately  I haven’t seen any major changes in my skin in terms of long lasting hydration or smoother skin. It’s just a normal moisturizer to me.
6444,Mer,1,14-Dec-18,,Oh my  my face feels incredibly soft after using this product. It has a very subtle pleasant scent. I put it on before I put on make up and it really makes a difference in the smoothness of my makeup. I think that I look younger because as my skin becomes more plump from absorbing the water the wrinkles are smoothed.
6445,ky,1,05-Feb-19,,I have difficult skin. My skin hates so many products and they make me either break out or swell up. I normally use k-beauty products but I decided to try this after reading so many positive articles about it. I was skeptical because I ve been using products with natural ingredients that I can pronounce  but this-this makes my skin SO soft and velvety.
6446,Amazon Customer,1,22-Apr-18,,I have problems with lotions as I do not like them heavy or greasy feeling in the slightest. I used to use Mary Kay s Velocity many years until it was discontinued. I tried several lotions before finding this one and falling in love! I have normal/combo skin (t zone may get slightly oily through the day when wearing makeup) with the winter time more to the normal side. This face lotion is perfect for me. It hydrates  yet does not leave my face feeling heavy or add more oily/greasy feeling. It can be used before putting makeup on and I have no problems. It is my new go to face lotion and I use it after every shower.
6447,TriniShopaholic,1,19-Jun-18,,I tried this just to see what the fuss was about and now I m a believer. A little dab goes a long way  and it absorbs into your skin quickly and completely  with a very soft matte finish. I used in the day and it held up well under makeup  used it at night and woke up oil-free  with soft  smooth skin. So far I have had no bad reactions to it  no break outs. It s 2 thumbs up.
6448,Roberta L. Barrett,1,15-Mar-18,,This is my usual brand. The place that I normally buy it doesn t stock it any more. So I tried something different and after using it for a month  my fine lines and wrinkles all started coming back. Was so glad when I saw that Amazon sells this! After using it again for just one week  my face started feeling softer. After 2 weeks  all the fine lines and wrinkles started to diminish. Whew! I ll never change brands again!
6449,UnaC,1,19-Sep-17,One person found this helpful,Since some dermatologists on YouTube highly recommended this I finally decided to give it a try. It s so much cheaper if you purchased this on Amazon comparing to drug store.  My skin is so soft after applying this. I can see the texture on my skin has improved and I rarely get dry cracks on my skin. I would recommend you give it a try if your skin is asking for remedy :P
6450,Jenna Young,1,01-Jan-19,,First of all  it smells so good!! I’m a fair skinned freckle face. Extremely sensitive to change. I’m in love. My crusty skin looks so good. It’s not an oil slick  it’s a dry moisturizer. You can apply your makeup immediately after. I usually break out from moisturizer but not this one. I will forever be a fan!
6451,robert smith,1,10-Dec-18,,I love this stuff. Trick is (I read up on it) clean face at night add regular moisturizer. Then add this on top of areas you deem necessary. It works by slipping the hyaluronic acid past skin barrier into the skin. Adds moisture and thus eliminates wrinkle. Very light and silky feel.
6452,Linda M.,1,15-Aug-17,One person found this helpful,I love this product! Had been using Clinique product similar to this for years  but the cost was getting ridiculous. I switched to this and it does exactly the same thing for a third of the cost. I use it every day. Non greasy and soaks right in to give your skin that extra protection against dryness that you need. Your makeup and sunscreen goes on a lot better over this also.
6453,Sarah M,0,16-Aug-18,,I have oily skin and was looking for a light moisturizer. This product is so lightweight and sinks into the skin amazingly. However there is a slight perfume and I think that s what made me breakout every time I used it. Only tried it twice but broke out both times.  However I did give it to my sister who has dry skin and she seems to love it.
6454,Kirsten Dent,1,03-Aug-17,One person found this helpful,This is only day 1 but...wow. I have oily  sensitive skin. My dermatologist recommended this. Thank god she did. This stuff is so hydrating without the greasy crap  it smells amazing and my skin (which hates everything and everyone) loves it. It s pricey but worth it!
6455,James_Tiberius_Perfecthair,1,09-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,I was really impressed with this. I use Clinique s moisture surge and this is very comparable. The biggest difference is its scented a bit stronger but its not a bad scent and it doesn t aggravate my sensitive skin.
6456,Chase,0,05-Jun-19,,It did not really moisturize my face despite the moistful texture.  Instead  it gave me skin troubles after a few days since I began to use it.  I should have better tested on my arm first  so that I didn t have to spend bucks on dermatologist.
6457,W. Hoff,1,04-Jan-16,One person found this helpful,I ve been using this probably 3 months now and absolutely love it. It smells great and makes my skin feel very soft. I have been going to a tanning bed so thought I would try it to hydrate my skin and it definately works. It s very creamy and I don t use very much it barely looks like i ve used any in my bottle. I didn t check the price at walmart or another store like that so not sure how the price is compared to them. I ve gotten lazy with Amazon so most my purchases are on here. But great product.
6458,Agnieszka A.,0,16-Mar-19,,My skin is not prone to break outs  only occasionally but I do have naturally dry skin and I feel like the fact that this doesn t have oil at all is not a good thing for me. I experienced little skin peeling with this product as well  like other reviewers stated.
6459,Amazon Customer,1,17-Feb-19,,Would give it 5 stars but the packaging is a little excessive. Makes it look like there’s a lot more product than there actually is. I love that it’s lightweight  but during the winter it’s a little too lightweight and I have to apply a lot more. Otherwise my skin gets dry again.
6460,RC,1,19-Jul-17,One person found this helpful,Holy Grail. Feels nice and smoothe. Smells so gooooooood. I use it when I wake up  before foundation and primer  after shower and before bed. And alone. Love love it. Will buy again and again as long as the price doesn t go up. Will recommend!
6461,Karyn,1,22-Sep-18,,This product is so wonderful! Your skin feels softer and clears up any problems. I get comments on my skin all the time. I have a lot of sun damage and this product helps small rough patches. My husband uses it daily for he is in salt water everyday and it has helped his skin so much! Highly recommended!
6462,SA,1,25-Apr-19,,I always had a dry but clear skin   but recently my skin starting developing acne near the T area . hunting for the face cream that help me stopping my skin turning oily near the T area .... and this is working perfectly   couldnt be happier

6464,Amazon Customer,1,08-Mar-19,,I second all the great reviews here! Love this stuff! Converted from Olay to Neutrogena for this baby. It has a really nice cooling  nourishing feel when you put it on  and it is not at all gluggy or heavy like some other moisturizers I ve tried. Hope you love it as much as I do!
6465,jessi,1,25-Jul-17,One person found this helpful,I have oily skin and I don t ever want a lotion that will make me look shiny or make me break out and this is perfect!! It doesn t leave any shine and hydrates my skin so well!

6467,Chelsie Luchini,1,19-Sep-17,,I love this moisturizer. It is one of my favorite from the drug store. It is great for my sensitive skin and keeps my skin moisturized when it starts to dry out. The gel formula feels really nice when putting on and it does have a nice fragrance with it. I was worried the fragrance would irritate my skin  but it didn t at all!
6468,Amazing Grace,1,27-Feb-16,5 people found this helpful,A small amount goes a long way!! This gel works wonders on tiny wrinkles under your eyes. It has a nice tightening effect immediately after you apply!
6469,Biddy Mulligan,1,29-Aug-16,2 people found this helpful,I love this hydro boost. It really does make the skin look soft and dewy. I m pretty old and it even works wonders on my hands. I highly recommend this product. PS.... every cream or oil made gives me pimples - even at my age. This one absolutely does not. I love this stuff.
6470,MasterCreep14,1,06-Aug-17,One person found this helpful,I have combination skin and this product makes my skin soak up the moisture without getting greasy later in the day. In fact the amount of oil production on my t-zone has reduced dramatically since I started using it.
6471,Amazon Customer,1,10-Mar-19,,This stuff has been a gamechanger for my skin. I live in Colorado and suffer from dehydrated skin. I love applying this stuff to my face and neck after using a gentle hydrating cleanser  before putting on makeup. I have pretty simple skin routines for morning and nighttime  but they always include the Hydroboost. My face is SO much happier and looks visibly younger  more radiant  and more supple.
6472,Emma C.,1,05-Jun-19,,My skin is sensitive to moisturizers  but I get dry patches without them. Most moisturizers cause my face to break out  but this one doesn t! It feels so smooth  and my dry patches are gone after less than a week of use. I ll definitely be buying this again.
6473,Darlene Parish,1,14-May-18,One person found this helpful,Love this stuff! Love the way it feels  love the way it smells! I look forward to putting it on  and that’s never happened with any other product I’ve tried!
6474,Sarah Bartiromo,1,12-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,LOVE this product. Makes my skin so hydrated and smooth feeling all day long.
6475,LF,1,07-Aug-18,,this has become My new facial moisturizer favorite. I ve even seen my husband put it on a couple times when his face gets dry. It has a light scent to it but it smells good. I have very sensitive skin to my face so this is one thing that doesn t make me break out which I love.
6476,BellaSouth,0,15-Mar-16,3 people found this helpful,I like the consistency of this gel  but it stings when I apply it and irritates my skin. Like other reviewers  it made my skin break out in little bumps. Not sure what causes that  but I won t be buying it again.
6477,Eva,1,15-Nov-17,13 people found this helpful,This moisturizer gel has been a great fit for my combination-sensitive skin. It s hydrating without leaving my skin shiny or causing breakouts or irritation. My skin tends to be oilier in the summer and drier in the winter and I ve found this moisturizer to work well year-round. A small amount goes a long way  so one container seems to last for months for me. I ve wasted a lot of money over the years in search of a moisturizer like this  so I m happy to have found this one.
6478,Alex,1,09-Jan-19,,I looked for a mousturizes for months and finally decided to try this out. I went to ulta and they have it for $19.99 so this price is a lot better than that one. My skin feels awesome after a couple of days and keeps my hydrated throughout the day
6479,Carla Fisher,1,26-Jun-17,One person found this helpful,I have super sensitive skin from lupus and normal/combo skin as far as oiliness is concerned. LOVE this. Has not made me break out at all. Hydrates my face and can be layered without feeling like a film. Great product.
6480,Carol Kennedy,1,21-Nov-17,2 people found this helpful,Seems to work well. Not expensive compared to the other product I have been using. So far so good.
6481,Karlita,1,26-Dec-18,,I love this so far. I only use it at night since it doesn’t have spf. It dries quickly and leaves my face feeling fresh and so soft. It definitely leaves my face feeling hydrated and also has a great smell to it. No icky residue in the morning. So far I think it’s working great!
6482,Margaret M. McNeil,1,19-Jan-19,,This is one of the best oil free moisturizers I have found. It can be quite tricky to find a moisturize that does not glop up my skin by adding unwanted  unneeded oil. This product does the trick without adding oil to the surface of my skin. Highly recommend it.
6483,Jessica,1,16-Jul-17,2 people found this helpful,Love this lotion it s super hydrating and doesn t leave my skin greasy or cause more breakouts. The smell is also very mild but pleasant. It obsorbs super quickly.
6484,Erik&Jess,1,18-Mar-18,,I have oily skin and wanted an oil-free moisturizer. Been using about a month and like it so far. The other day my hands were super dry and cracking and I didn’t have any other lotion on me so I put this on my hands and it really worked! They felt better instantly and stayed hydrated all day!
6485,Juliet,1,19-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,My absolute favorite moisturizer for over 6 months now  I can t go without it! During the winter months I apply a double layer  and my face hasn t dried out at all! Neutrogena rarely ever disappoints.
6486,Trista,1,31-Jul-18,,Ok  greatest moisturizer ever. I didn t realize how greasy the moisturizers are that I ve been using for 10+ years until I tried this  and it is absolutely amazing. It just disappears into your skin and I don t think I ll ever buy another kind.
6487,Amazon Customer,1,16-Nov-18,,Being in my 40 s  I feel I need to have some kind of moisturizer. This sinks right in and doesn t feel greasy at all  it feels refreshing as well and doesn t break me out like most others do. Will repurchase.
6488,Lady in Pink,1,26-Sep-17,One person found this helpful,this product is even better than the hydration jell from loreal. I used to use the ones from Loreal  but now I am switching. It has more moisturizer in the jell and smoother than other brands. Plus it also has the hyaluronic acid in it.
6489,Jennifer,1,24-Jul-18,,I have dry skin  particularly on my forehead  and this really helps. My skin care routine dries out my face if I am not diligent with moisturizing. This is perfect. I apply it once in the morning  once before applying makeup  and once after my skin care routine at night.
6490,Angelique Leeanna Capra,1,15-Jul-18,,Excellent oil free moisture that leaves skin soft and clean for hours. I wash my face twice a day and use this product after. I have naturally oily skin that means with most products after only a few hours my eyes are burning. Please note that I do not use makeup over this.
6491,Lynnae L.,1,07-Jul-18,,I have combo skin. Mostly oily with dry patches. So getting a hydrating moisturizer is hit or miss. This one however is very smooth and cooling. Softens my pores and really hydrates the dry spots. Very happy with the results!
6492,Suraj Shetty,1,30-Oct-18,,This has replaced my other aftershaves  as I love how it helps tighten up my pores and leaves my skin non-greasy and clean. Have been using it this way for almost a year now with excellent results. I tend to have oily skin and this works great for me.
6493,IowaKay,1,12-Jun-18,,I have read multiple articles on this stuff and alot of people rave about it. My friend encouraged me to try it out for my oil skin and i am in love with it! It smells wonderful and makes my face feel moisturized but not heavy.
6494,Robert K.,1,29-Jun-18,,Best moisturizer ever  but expensive. Luckily a dab is enough for an arm or neck. Eases dry skin and itchiness quickly. Long lasting. Soaks in  so no greasy body areas. Great right after a shower. Dry skin has been a lifelong problem  this is best solution ever for me.
6495,Adrian A.  Johnson,1,14-May-18,One person found this helpful,Light  non greasy with enough exfoliant to keep my skin fresh and supple. My skin just drinks this up!
6496,Celine W,1,29-Apr-19,,I have oily but dehydrated skin so a moisturizer is necessary but prior to this most moisturizers would still be somewhat greasy even if they are oil free. This one is so light and absorbs quickly.
6497,Kate B.,1,31-Dec-17,5 people found this helpful,I was a loyal user of Garnier s gel formula moisturizer for a long time  and while I still think it s a good product  I have to say that this one slightly edges it out. i found that with the Garnier moisturizer  I had to use it for a little while to notice a difference in my skin  but with this product  I think it works pretty much overnight. My skin is combination--slightly oily nose/cheekbones but dry flaking forehead and chin. I find that this does a nice job giving moisture to my dry zones without over-moisturizing my oil zones. I also like the smell.
6498,Ms.T,1,14-May-18,One person found this helpful,this hydrates without irritating my sensitive skin or triggering my allergies to synthetic fragrance - highly recommend.
6499,Marjorie,1,25-May-19,,I absolutely LOVE this product! I can t use oily products  and this one is not greasy at all. Lightweight and water based  goes on well and feels fantastic! I love the scent  too!
6500,Shawna,1,16-Apr-18,,Love  love  love this stuff! I have dry patches on my cheeks and nose and this helps smooth them out. Unfortunately its not strong enough to last all day in the area I live in  but for morning and night its great! It didn t break me out and I am a sensitive skin type.
6501,Jeff,1,18-Dec-18,,For the price I don t think you can get a better face moisturizer. I hate it when they leave a sticky film on my face and this one does not. It reminds me of much pricier moisturizers.
6502,JM,1,11-May-18,One person found this helpful,My wife loves it and she is very picky. Enough said.
6503,ldydianna,1,12-May-19,,My skin loves this moisturizer  it has taken awhile to find a product that kept my skin feeling soft and supple and this one does. There is no scent which is even better.
6504,SoPasGal,1,13-Jun-19,,I m in my 60s  and I ve never liked heavy moisturizer on my face  even though I have dry skin (especially in winter)  but this gel works wonders  regardless of season.
6505,Buffy,1,21-Feb-17,3 people found this helpful,Works well  really does boost moisture over other things we ve tried in our cold  dry winter weather.
6506,Lori12547,1,02-Sep-18,,The best moisturizer I’ve ever used. This is water based. It literally glides on your skin. Doesn’t leave a sticky residue. Leaves your face soft and healthy looking. My skin feels so hydrated after using this. I’d be lost without it.
6507,kmamaw,1,20-Jul-18,,I like this so much! It feels light on my face and doesn’t make me breakout. It seems like the jar will last for a long time because you don’t need a lot. I’ve been using it for a while and have noticed that my skin is softer.
6508,Elsie Hidalgo,1,20-May-19,,Love this stuff! It is very hydrating  but is more of a light gel than a cream. Seems to work best directly after taking a shower and makes my skin feel very smooth!
6509,Leah Anderson,1,17-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,I ve been looking for a new face moisturizer that doesn t cost half of my rent and this one is it! Smells great and the gel texture goes on smoothly and dries quickly. Skin feels moisturized and absorbs the gel quickly so it s great under makeup too. Loveee it!
6510,Sarah,1,03-Apr-18,,This moisturizer is so good for dry skin. It s not heavy or oily  but my skin feels super moisturize after I use it. I also have rosacea  and this stuff doesn t irritate or exacerbate it at all. My skin looks happy and healthy lately since I started using this.
6511,Phanha Proche,0,24-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,The product came really fast. It is smooth and soft texture with cooling effect. What i don t like about it is that the package seemed to already use or open before shipping out to me. It is not like a brand new product.
6512,Mrs. Anthony,1,26-Jul-17,One person found this helpful,If you have sensitive skin and cannot find a good moisturizer this is for you. Had great results from the first application. No reaction. No redness. No breakout. Just soft smooth skin. Way to go Neutrogena!
6513,K.Y,1,04-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,Use this after washing your face  either in the morning or night. It helps keep your skin moist and clear.
6514,Holly,1,02-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,Very pleasant smell. Not greasy. However  I feel like it absorbs into my skin to much. I have very dry skin. I still have to use vitamin E oil after I apply this moisturizer.
6515,LizabethAnn0318,1,28-Feb-18,,ughhhh this stuff is the greatest  I live in humid Florida and I love that I can put this on after a shower and use my sunscreen and nothing runs into my eyes and burns if I am active and sweating and it does not take forever to absorb into my skin.
6516,carmella lonzi,1,19-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,For my dry skin in the winter  this is great stuff. Used to spending $35 for moisturizer but no longer. Of course  I layer this with a primer and good foundation for a 14 hour day.
6517,sunnyskies,1,20-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,I have sensitive skin and had no problems. Adds fullness and definitely can tell it s moisturizing well. Tiny lines showing improvement too. Will buy again!
6518,R,1,15-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,This has become my go to moisturizer under makeup! It absorbs quickly and does not irritate my sensitive skin! love how quickly it absorbs and how cool it feels as it goes on.
6519,2kids,1,20-Mar-19,,Needed a moisturizer that wouldn t make me greasy  as I have naturally greasy skin. This stuff is great. I still get oily  but it takes much longer  and it goes on clean-feeling. Very happy with this.
6520,Alek,1,07-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,Noticeable improvement to my dry  acne-prone skin within two days. Wish the fragrance wasn t so strong (smells like detergent) but am a big fan of the product so far.
6521,D. Edwards,1,25-Feb-15,One person found this helpful,I love this product. It feels like liquid ice or it could just be subliminal. Anyway  it glides on so soft and absorbs into the face in seconds. No trace of anything. Leaves my face feeling so light and fresh. It has such a light tranquil scent when you first put in on but the scent fades so its nothing offensive or strong. My skin look like satin and stays that way throughout the day. I am hooked.
6522,Betti726,1,10-Dec-18,,I love this moisturizer. I have pretty sensitive skin and easily break out. Not with this Moisturizer. And it leaves my skin feeling so nice.
6523,200inpink,1,27-Sep-17,One person found this helpful,Love this product. I use it under my sunscreen before I go out on my runs. After my runs when I wash my face I use some more upscale moisturizers.
6524,Norma,1,23-Aug-18,One person found this helpful,Since this line came out  I ve bought everything--cleanser  SPF lotion  tinted moisturizer. I have really sensitive skin but it responds well to hyaluronic acid and Hydroboost is slightly cheaper than most of the other hyaluronic products out there. Thought the gel might actually be too drying but it s not  works wonders.
6525,Kindle Customer,1,02-Dec-16,One person found this helpful,I ordered this as a dupe for the Tarte Drink of H2O hydro boost gel and aside from the color and scent  it works amazingly similar. I m not sure of the similarity in the formula  but as far as results go it s a great moisturizer (I have non-sensitive skin so not sure for more delicate skin types).
6526,zerodin,1,19-Jan-19,,I live in wisconsin our winter s can be brutal & leave skin very dry. I actually saw a difference overnight using for the 1st time. My skin looked better. I will be a regular customer of this product.
6527,Brenda,1,16-Dec-16,2 people found this helpful,I have the absolute most finicky skin. Too oily  too dry  too red. It s crazy! But this gel really does boost moisture leaving my skin looking & feeling healthier  not too dry...not too oily. Just right.
6528,Ilona,1,13-May-19,,Bought it after spending a $100+ at Sephora on other fancy options  great product  affordable $16 and a nice scent. The only thing is I missed when it ended last time  one night I just opened it and there was almost nothing left... hahah Because it is all light blue  inside and the product itself  you might miss when you finish it  so be more attentive than me) other than that  I am happy with my purchase.
6529,Saluki Mom,1,01-May-18,,Feel fresh cool and clean going on  smells clean. Not greasy. Good stuff. but can t say my skin is any different after several weeks of daily use.
6530,Dietitian Julie,1,14-Nov-15,One person found this helpful,I still have very oily skin in my 30 s but have learned that having some type of non pore clogging moisturizer really helps. I can tell a difference in my skin s texture since using this. With winter approaching  I am hoping to see a bigger difference because I do get a few spots around my nose that get dry in winter. I made sure to get the water gel version due to my oily pores.
6531,Albin,1,16-Oct-17,One person found this helpful,Feels great  smells great and it works well to moisturize the skin.
6532,Sarah,1,13-Feb-19,,This product is great. I do my regular face cleaning and once this goes on my whole face is smooth and feels great through out the whole day and night. I do have sensitive skin so I was a little worried about trying it  but it worked out great and will keep buying. 100% satisfied and Happy.
6533,Brittany,1,18-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,Love the smell  texture  and hydration. It just broke me out. I did use it for over a month and it just kept happening. I can use this on ultra dry areas though.
6534,Michele M. Marks,1,05-Apr-16,One person found this helpful,Moisturizes without oiliness. I have extraordinarily oily skin. This stuff feels great on. I only use a very little bit  so it s lasting a long time. On dry days  I use during the day  but on humid Florida days  I use only at night.
6535,Amazon Customer,1,08-Jun-19,,Very good clean product for just adding moisture to the skin. If you need to use something on top of your regimen that s the one.
6536,SKW,1,07-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,Doesn t leave a greasy feel. No breakouts. Good value.
6537,Al W.,1,01-Jul-17,One person found this helpful,Wife says it has healed a dry rough area on her face that has been troublesome for three years.
6538,Lexi Tabakov,1,16-Mar-18,,This stuff is AMAZING! I use tretinoin gel on my face and is causes really dry skin. And my face would get super oily during the day  I d have to reapply translucent powder every now and then to keep the oil stuff. But after this stuff  I have no issues. Miracle worker. And smells heavenly too.
6539,Chelsea,1,31-Mar-18,,I work in a Fab with regulated air  so my skin gets ultra dry. I was so happy to find that this product did not only rehydrate my skin but also prevented my skin from drying out at work  as long as I put it on beforehand. It is also super lightweight and doesn t feel weird and sticky like some moisturizers do. Definitely something I would recommend to any of my friends.
6540,Eileen,1,16-Jun-19,,Really feels good on my skin. Am using it under my daily moisturizer and my night cream. Don t know if it is reducing any wrinkles as I have so many!
6541,B,1,19-Mar-18,,I HATE lotion so I’ve been trying different gels and I think I’ve found the one! It makes my skin powdery soft and very hydrated looking/ feeling. I still wear a primer under makeup but I don’t feel like I have to with this. I love it!
6542,Bruce,1,04-Jun-19,,This stuff works wonders. It s not oily  it dries quickly  and it lets your skin moisturize itself essentially. It s ungodly good.
6543,Euriejesty,1,21-Jun-19,,Like it. Smells fresh. Very moisturizing. Was using it with the serum cuz my dermatologist told me not to use anything with oil.
6544,Diana Z.,1,12-Dec-18,,Tengo cutis graso y la uso de noche  ya que de d?a me deja no me hace bien  cara brillante y grasosa con el paso de la horas.
6545,kimie,1,07-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,I like the way this feels on my face. The dryer weather and old age has left my face feeling dry and cracked. I use the Neutrogena Hydro boost after my shower and at night. Problem solved. My skin feels alive again. Thank you Neutrogena.
6546,Carly,1,06-Feb-19,,My favorite moisturizer!! I have oily skin and it’s the perfect amount of hydration! Smells great  very light and a little goes a long way!

6548,Christabelle Briens,1,08-Apr-18,,Love this so so much! The smell is amazing  it s amazing for sensitive and dry skin and it doesn t leave your face sticky. After it dries it feels like you have nothing on your face so it s great to wear under makeup. A little goes a long way with this product so even though it comes in a small quantity it lasts a long time. Will be purchasing again!
6549,TB,0,06-Jun-19,,Product appearance is blue and has a strong smell. The one I received came already opened. Unsanitary and Very Disappointed.
6550,Jeong Family,1,31-May-19,,I have a sensitive skin and most of the moisturizers that i used result to whiteheads... But this one doesnt and is not oily.
6551,Wendy J. McLaughlin,1,27-Sep-18,,I simply love this product. Doesn t leave my face oily or dry. Feel hydrated and just using after 48 hours I could see the improvements.
6552,Cristina Leaf,0,10-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,I’ve used this 3 times since getting it and each time it has made my face bright red and itchy. This is definitely not for me. Disappointed that there doesn’t seem to be a way to return it.

6558,Oscar Sarinana,1,05-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,I just received this this and used it for the first time today. My first impression is that I love it! The scent is lite and refreshing...not strong at all. And it took no time before it melted into my skin. I’m very happy.
6559,Amy G,1,17-Jan-18,7 people found this helpful,I have had a long history with normal moisturizers  since my skin is all over- oily one day  totally dry the next  but I love the hydro boost. You only need a little bit per application  so the price is reasonable. On my dry days  I apply the hydro boost and then a dab of Vaseline over my cheeks and forehead. Great for finicky skin types.
6560,Brent Scott Uhler,1,17-Jul-18,,This stuff is magic for my oily skin and large pores since everything breaks me out  but not this!  It also helps control the oil on my face and I couldn t be more happy with this stuff.
6561,Nicole,1,23-Feb-19,,Before this My skin was embarrassingly dry  flaking and VERY noticeable. After a few weeks of using this alongside proper exfoliation  I’ve been good.

I keep it in he refrigerator and use it after cleansing my face morning & night. Very Refreshing!!

6598,RN,1,09-Feb-16,2 people found this helpful,This moisturizer is fantastic and feels cool on the skin when applied. It soaks into the skin very nicely and works well under makeup. My only gripe is that I need an anti-aging moisturizer at my age and this one doesn t fill that need. It is a good basic moisturizer for younger skin or just days when you want to keep it simple.
6599,G,1,02-Sep-18,,Fantastic product! I highly recommend this for anyone with oily skin. I use the entire series and it is the only series I will ever use from now on.
6600,Gabrielle T.,1,10-Jan-17,One person found this helpful,I ve got skin that changes what is based on where I am. In some parts of Europe it s really dry  in Florida it s oily  and it Alabama it s combination.  This is a nice  light moisturizer that sinks in quickly. The only thing I don t like is the added fragrance and color.
6601,maria terriquez,1,02-Jul-19,,My mom has psoriasis and dry face and this boosted moisture and softer skin she loves it
6602,Laura Matthews,1,24-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,Perfect for me as I love in the desert. Makes my face really smooth. Tried so many different products  including high end face creams. This is definitely the best
6603,Cory,1,02-Aug-18,,LOVE this product. I had lost weight and was getting major neck wrinkles  my dermatologist recommended Hydro Boost and it s great! Smooths out those wrinkles in no time.
6604,The slow life,1,05-Jan-18,,Don’t drink as much water as I should at work. My wrinkles look worse due to dehydration. This product works better for me than those tiny tubes of expensive serum specifically for fine lines and crow’s feet.
6605,kevin mulrooney,1,13-Oct-16,2 people found this helpful,good price wife likes the product
6606,Ramona,1,05-Mar-18,,Have it only two days. I m using it in the morning and evening. Feel super boost and fresh. No side effects like rushes  pimples  or itchy. (I tent to get very fast bad skin reactions on stuff).
6607,mgocwexford,1,30-Sep-16,One person found this helpful,I have been using this for about two months and my skin is beautifully hydrated and the fine lines are diminishing. I even use it on my ultra dry hands. Best thing I ve come across in years.
6608,Anne,1,08-Mar-19,,Made me break out! But i guess it is because of my skin adjusting to the nee product?
6609,SprayTanGirl,1,26-Jul-17,One person found this helpful,My daughter is hooked on this. It is perfect for her teenage skin and doesn t cause breakouts.
6610,tigerj,1,13-Dec-17,,I really like this  especially because its a gel  not a heavy cream which I hate. My skin drinks this in and doesn t leave a greasy feel at all. What I hate...the jar. I wish they would put this in a pump bottle.
6611,Amber M.,1,10-Apr-18,2 people found this helpful,I do not like to spend a lot of money on products  and even $15 for a facial lotion seemed excessive to me. But I’d heard so many great things about this product that I had to try it. It’s been a full year (Amazon tells me it’s about 2 weeks shy of the date I bought it)  and I just now used the last of it. But even if it had lasted half that long it would have been worth it. Because of the silky gel formula  only a tiny amount is needed. I barely dip the tip of a finger in  and I’m able to rub my hands together and cover my entire face. Because it is oil-free  it does not leave my face feeling greasy at all. I have acne prone skin even in my early thirties  but using this in tandem with my Curology acne cream and Norfex facial cloths has almost completely cleared up my face. My only complaints are that there is a slight floral fragrance (it does dissipate quickly) and that I wish it contained SPF. Neutrogena does make a couple products from this line that contain SPF  so I may need to test one of those out next.
6612,Nubian Queen,1,30-Nov-18,,This will be my third time buying this product. This the only product that don t break me out!! Good for dry and senitive skin

6649,JP,1,26-Jan-18,5 people found this helpful,This stuff is amazing. Gel moisturizers make my makeup look 100% better than when I use cream moisturizers. BUT I prefer the Hydro Boost for extra dry skin. The consistency is thicker and has less of a scent  and it just feel so good on the skin and is never heavy. This one is also very good  I just prefer the thicker cream!
6650,NO-EMI.,1,07-Dec-18,,The breaking out is so real these days and needed a good moisturizer atleast twice a day. Glad it is saving my skin!

6669,Caroline Rose,1,13-May-17,2 people found this helpful,Great product but IMO very poorly packaged  on two counts. First  it s so liquidy that once when I accidentally slightly tilted the jar  this wonderful but relatively expensive product spilled onto my dresser  where it did no good at all. Second  the wide lid is problematic for those of us with hand issues; getting my hand around it and turning it is painful  and this is even after successful surgery for my arthritis. News flash to Neutrogena: this is a product that older people will use  and older people tend to have joint aches (and women tend to have smaller hands than men; did men design this packaging?). I wonder why it s in a jar at all  and not a tube; maybe because tubes can t have thick   false  bottoms as this jar does (it s a lot less product than I expected  but a little goes a very long way). Bottom line  I d give the product itself 5 stars (I m noticing good results after only a week) and I ll no doubt keep buying it  but the packaging gets 1 star.
6670,honeybee,1,19-May-17,One person found this helpful,So many hydrating lotions just leave my skin feeling greasy. This isn t greasy at all. Very light and refreshing.

6675,Alia Atreides,0,06-Jul-17,6 people found this helpful,I did NOT receive this for a discount (as most of the reviewers did). It irritates my skin very badly  but it does moisturize it. I have oily skin  and was recommended this through the Curology website  but it s not great if you ve got sensitive skin or are using a retinoid that makes your skin more sensitive.

6690,Maria I.,1,30-Mar-19,,I use this every day. Makes my skin soft.
6691,Amzn Customer,1,03-Mar-15,2 people found this helpful,I LOVE THIS GEL!!! Let me start of by saying that I do not have bad skin. I average about 7 breakouts a year. I have used Proactiv+  the  proclaimed gift from God  for skin  and this is better than any Proactiv+ product  in my opinion. Proactiv+ has a 3 step program that always left my skin a bit oily when I woke up from a nights sleep  took days to rid my face of mild acne  and it is TOO EXPENSIVE!! The Hydro Boost gel left my skin soft as a baby s bottom and oil-free. 10 hrs after putting it on  which was before bed  I woke up looking radiant! I already use a face brightening scrub  but this enhanced the brightness in my skin tenfold. It gave me a more even skin-tone  which I LOVE because I am weening myself off of makeup. The clearer my skin is  the quicker I can stop clogging my pores with makeup! I have never used Neutrogena face products before  but I will continue to use this as long as they sell it. It doesn t have a harsh smell  it applies smoothly  and it lasts! It does not have the consistency of an actual gel (like the thick  jell-o ones you use for your hair)  it is more of a light  airy cream that has a blue tint to it. I love to overdo everything. I always feel that the more product I use  the better off I ll be  but trust me when I say that you do not need that much product. Which is another pro. When I first saw that this little container was $15  I was hesitant because I am used to buying products over the counter that costs less than $10  but you really get your money s worth. I see this lasting me two months  and I wash my face twice a day. An extremely little dab covers my whole face. I am so glad I came across this product. In case you wanted to know  my daily regimen is as follows: scrub in cleanser (with my clean  washed hands...never clean your face with dirty hands) for 2min. to exfoliate  apply astringent to further clean my face of any dirt the scrub didn t get  and then I moisturize with the gel. My skin has never looked better and I am truly thankful for this affordable product. Excellently priced and does a great job. As I said before  I don t have bad skin...so if you re looking for a miracle to help with cystic acne or anything of the sort..I wouldn t look to this product for salvation. However  it definitely helps with the occasional break out. I am also adding a clay mask to my face regimen  which is supposed to exfoliate and unclog pores so hopefully that even furthers my skin success. I wish you all good luck in determining which product is right for you. I know narrowing it down can be hard  but I hope this review provides some perspective!

6694,Beach Girl,1,13-Aug-15,7 people found this helpful,This is the second bottle of Hydro Boost Water Gel I have purchased from Amazon. I really like how it absorbs quickly into my skin. I use a prescription retinol each night in addition to this. I will apply the retinol and wait about 20 minutes and apply a thin layer of the Hydro Boost..it tingles slightly but it actually feels pretty good:) I have somewhat oily skin also and it doesn t make me any more oily during the day when I apply before putting on makeup. Has a great smell too..very clean and fresh.

6759,NG,1,08-Sep-16,9 people found this helpful,I really like this product and it smells wonderful. I am generally not crazy about products that are scented but I like this one. It goes on pretty wet and I wasn t sure how it would absorb but within a few minutes it was gone  absorbed completely. It left my face feeling soft and hydrated.  I don t use it as a stand alone moisturizer. I apply a vitamin C serum first. Once that has absorbed completely and had a chance to work I apply Aveeno Absolutely Ageless  Daily Moisturizer SPF 30 which is a little oily and leaves me with a kind of shiny face. Thats where Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel comes in. I apply it over the Aveeno Moisturizer SPF 30. After it absorbs the shine is gone and my skin is really soft and hydrated all day. I also use it at night over my night time cream (retin a). I am not sure it would work well as a stand alone daily moisturizer as it doesn t have a very good range of beneficial ingredients but it works excellent over a moisturizer.  CONS: Cost It is a little expensive to have to use it over a moisturizer packed with skin loving nutrients where it is lacking.

This is a great moisturizer for all skin types; an even greater moisturizer for anyone with Oily/Combination skin types. It s lightweight enough to give you the moisture you need without being too much that will clog your pores. It gives my skin balanced moisture. I m in love with the lightweight gel texture. Its moisturizing done easy. I m trying other moisturizers soon in order to transition to spring/summer season. However  this product will be in constant rotation throughout the year. A staple in my skincare must-haves.

6835,PatienceRN,1,27-Apr-18,7 people found this helpful,I have very oily skin and acne prone. And yes  people with oily skin need a moisturizer because it provides hydration to the skin which keeps your skin from producing more oil. (Any dermotologist will tell you that  mine did too). I have used this for a few days (morning and night) and have already noticed a difference. My face is less oily! Before my facial skin would be an oil greasy slick 30 min after washing  but after applying this gel  it doesn’t get oily until after about 12 hours  and even then  it’s nothing compared to the oiliness I’d have if I didn’t use this. I’m so impressed with this gel. I wish I would’ve found this years ago. My face has not broken out in pimples from this gel either. I don’t have to use much of it  a little dab on the fingertip goes a long way. With the small amount I need for my entire face  this stuff will easily last me for over a year. It smells great but not strong. Leaves the face feeling so soft. I highly recommend this gel for anyone  including those with oily skin or acne prone skin. It’s non-comedogenic so it won’t clog pores. I love it.

6855,aneurysm,1,06-Nov-15,2 people found this helpful,So far - SO good. I m scared that I ll break out like crazy from this in two weeks  but my review after two days of use in the AM and PM is very positive. Water based gel hydrators are intended for acne-prone and oily skin. Oily skin doesn t need more oil. Dry skin won t benefit at all from this type of product because they don t produce enough oil and so they do need some oil in their moisturizer to balance them out. So  it smells great to me  a light and fresh but barely-there scent that disappears instantly. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin smooth and not tacky at all. I believe that it looks plumper (that would be due to the hyaluronic acid) and more hydrated. It s so hard for me to find something that doesn t break me out. Like I said  we will see what happens two weeks from now  but if there is no update here then assume all is well.

6914,roops,1,14-Nov-15,3 people found this helpful,I tend to get some dryness on my face in the winter months and decided to use this gel to combat those issues. It easily absorbs into areas of dryness (it kind of lets you know which parts of your face are dry!). I would say that it does maintain that moisture level in the dry areas for quite some time (4-5 hours perhaps).. then it will go dry again.. so I tend to keep this stuff around in case that happens.. it really does help though for all dry areas on the face. more than other products of the same ilk.
6915,CN,1,19-Jul-15,6 people found this helpful,I wanted to try this product because it contains hyaluronic acid for my aging  combination skin. I really like the silky feel of this moisturizer and the fact that it is absorbed by the skin quite quickly and doesn t leave a greasy feeling. I wear it under foundation or alone and the moisture seems to last all day; I haven t used it long enough to see lasting results but I can see this becoming my daily moisturizer.

It s not an over powering scent that ll give you a headache but more of like a refreshing scent. Overall I really enjoy this product. I use it ever morning and night and as a moisturizer under my makeup and I have extremely oily skin  but it doesn t leave my face feeling greasy or oily at all.

I have combination skin and used to wake up in the morning with an oil slick on my face. I wake up now with a normal feeling complexion - not too oily  not too dry. I’ve been using it after applying a glycolic acid serum and the two pair well. I currently have three moisturizers on rotation (thanks to combination skin) and I haven’t used this during the day yet  so I don’t know how well it would work with my daytime serum  primer  and makeup. I recently had a sample for a very expensive water gel moisturizer and I found that the Hydro Boost works just as well. The only difference being that my skin feels tacky just after applying the Hydro Boost  whereas with the more expensive water gel it seemed to absorb quickly and smoothly. But the tackiness from the Hydro Boost does go away  leaving my skin feeling nice and smooth. I will definitely keep this in my moisturizer rotation.
6928,Maisha Simpson,1,13-Feb-19,,Amazing product
6929,Amazon Customer,1,19-Dec-17,,I love this stuff!! It really is like a huge drink of water for your face.
6930,Belle Lores,1,19-Jul-15,,Good product to make your face feel cool and refreshed  It does not leave the skin feeling greasy.
6931,Anna N.,0,09-May-16,2 people found this helpful,After watching a ton of YouTube videos about this product (including itsJudyTime!)  I put in an order and was thrilled to receive it. I ripped off the packaging and applied some of the product onto my face. The feeling is cool and comforting  just as I had expected. However  the smell was absolutely awful. I prefer clean and fresh scents from my products. Generally  no-fragrance products are best for your skin. I m not sure what this product claims to be  but I can certainly account for the fact that it smells like 20 bowls of potpourri mixed with used socks. The smell was just so offensive  and it was just worse that it was a product you apply to your face. I really wanted to like this product  especially because I love gel moisturizers and it actually did feel great on my skin. But I couldn t put up with the smell. It did not waver after having it on for awhile. I use the Body Shop s Vitamin C Glow Boosting Moisturizer instead  it s AMAZING and so is the smell (fresh  clean  and citrusy)!
6932,Taylor H.,0,27-Aug-16,One person found this helpful,I wish this was not scented. I d like it more without the scent which seems unnecessary. Does do a good job of quickly hydrating skin though.

For the first time in my 30+ years  I have found a moisturizer that didn t feel greasy  clog my pores  or leave me with a nasty feeling on my face. On top of that  my face feels great  and I don t have to pay a lot. I love this product. Well done  Neutrogena

6952,Candygal,1,07-Aug-15,11 people found this helpful,This is WONDERFUL. The first time I used it  I had bathed and then sat on the bed  took 3 fingertips into it and spotted it over my face. It soaks in easily  glides as you smooth it across your face  get into the creases and down the sides of your face. It dried quickly  did not leave my face feeling tight  and there was no sticky gooey mess. My face felt so smooth and soft. Since I ve started using it  my make up glides on without leaving any in the pores. It doesn t use a lot and I now am including my neck and upper chest area and it s all feels so soft. This is one product I will continue to buy.

It only takes a very small amount of the gel to do the job! My skin has never felt to hydrated and comfortable. The effect lasts all day  and this product also makes my makeup go on easily and smoothly. This is by far the best moisturizer I ve tried--absorbs quickly with no sticky feel and leaves my very dry skin feeling refreshed and comfortable.

6969,d,1,11-Jan-16,,Update: I’m on my third jar of this stuff (one jar lasts a pretty long time)  and I’ve noticed the same flaw with the packaging  or the jar itself. The lid and screw top are made of plastic  so if you drop the jar  even onto a soft surface  the plastic can crack. I’ve ended up with small bits of plastic from the screw part of the jar in the moisturizer. This also makes it impossible to completely seal the lid with part of the screw missing. I would recommend that if you plan on traveling with this product  you transfer some to a sturdier container. The large jar shape also makes it tough to pack light in a small toiletry bag.  I bought this item after seeing an ad on tv for it. I wanted to try a lightweight moisturizer that would keep my skin hydrated throughout the day even in the dry winter but not feel too thick or greasy. I also have sensitive combination skin  so many products either irritate or don t work for my entire face. This stuff is pretty great so far  after using most days for the past few weeks. The scent is light and not overpowering as well. I haven t noticed any difference in my face or skin other than that it seems to be hydrated and not as dry as it was when I used my old moisturizer  which was clean and clear brand.
6970,Amazon Customer,1,31-Dec-17,,Feels great but is way too perfumey.

I never had a similar problem even with cheapest brand.

6990,Lauren Lipcon,1,10-Oct-16,One person found this helpful,I love this gel! I had been using overpriced high end hyaluronic creams from the dermatologist. But would only buy them sometimes because of the price. I was so excited to see a fairly priced version from Neutrogena so I tried it. It works great! I use a regular cream moisturizer over it. This gel really locks the moisture in as it s designed to do. And it does not cause me to break out (everything does - so this in itself is amazing!). Some people say there is a smell. There is an odor but its not offensive to me. I am very sensitive to odors and put off by most. Not this gel. I am purchasing it for the 4th time as I write this! Thank you Neutrogena!

6992,Avid reader,1,14-Dec-16,One person found this helpful,So smooth and luxurious. Smells amazing. A very tiny bit goes a long way. Soaks in completely. No greasy or tacky feeling. Best way to hydrate flaky winter skin in my family. I even use it on my 2 year old for the little eczema patches that she gets on her face from time to time. I layer it under my regular moisturizer with sunscreen during the winter and it is never greasy or tacky. I really love this stuff.
6993,Amazon Customer,1,09-Jan-17,,LOVE IT FOR MY OILY SKIN
6994,Karissa,0,07-Jun-17,One person found this helpful,I purchased this to try as a gel moisturizer for my acne prone skin. I used to use Clinique gel moisturizer   but this is just okay . Don t notice any difference in how my face looks or feels.  It has a strong fragrance smell  and I actually don t feel comfortable putting over my entire face I think it could or does break me out. Probably Won t repurchase this again.
6995,Kristin Sherman,0,03-Jan-17,3 people found this helpful,I was so excited to try this but the first night I used it  it made my skin feel really dry. The second night it was dry and I noticed my skin was peeling off. After that  I got rid of it and moisturized like crazy.
6996,Yu Liu,1,19-Dec-17,,I have been using this product for a bit more than week now  and I definitely saw an improvement on my skin. I have the kind of skin that s oily (definitely not greasy) and a bit flaky after washing my face  especially in the dry winter. The product has a very liquid-like texture  very light and gets absorbed by the skin quickly  and this is the only product I can use without making my face oily so far. I use it every night after a good shower and it keeps my face moisturized all day the next day. It has been a good experience using this product  and I would most certainly purchase this product again. Hope this review helps you!
6997,Jerky Lover,1,11-Aug-15,One person found this helpful,it feels and smells great!
6998,Ginger,1,15-Dec-16,,I can t rave about this product enough! I have tried countless moisturizers over the last few years  trying to find something that would actually help with my dry skin and not cause me to break out  and I have finally found it! This stuff makes my skin feel so refreshed  hydrated  and insanely soft after it s soaked in. It is so light weight  which I definitely prefer to heavy  thick creams. I ve been using this product daily for almost a week now and have actually noticed a difference with my skin. No more flaky dry patches! The only slight issue I have with it is the scent. It has a very sterile  medicinal fragrance  but it goes away after a while and is beyond worth putting up with for a few minutes. I DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone suffering with dry skin. If you haven t tried this yet  you need to.
6999,Stephanie Darby,0,27-Jan-18,2 people found this helpful,I used this ONCE and had one of the worst cystic acne breakouts I have ever had  and my face had been completely clear and fine prior to using this. My face still has not recuperated from this. Horrible product.

7001,Chelsea,1,29-Dec-17,,I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!!! I have combination oily skin and it seems to be perfect for me.  *After 1 use: my skin was extremely soft and smooth  and all the oil was gone from my skin. This stuff soaks in almost instantly.  *After 3 days use (twice daily): my skin already feels less oily and I no longer wake up feeling extremely oily on my forehead. My skin also seems a bit more radiant and fresh looking. Dare I say even my under eye circles are slightly less apparent? Maybe it s my imagination  but my face looks so bright and healthy now!

I had a full tube before a work trip  flew to the location  went to use this and half the tube was gone. Kind of annoying that they don t really tell you that. Wasted a lot of the product because of that.

7007,Dee,1,22-Jul-16,25 people found this helpful,I ve used both this and garner hydro gel. I love garnier! But this I must say is way better. Garnier is more gel and no cream-base  this has a little  cream  to it. Even the color says it. I ve been using this  especially during the summer  since I have oily to combination skin and it does the miracle. I ve had no break-outs and my face feels fresh. Sometimes when I feel like my skin is extremely dry (combination skin rem?) I use an organic oil on top of it  jojoba or coconut . A hydro-boost indeed. **An update. I just purchased a second bottle and this is still so good for my skin (Yes  keep in mind that skin types are different). Breakouts are kept at bay  moisturizes without the heavy cream feel.
7008,TeriLynn,0,27-Jul-18,2 people found this helpful,I wanted to like this product so bad but unfortunately is made my cystic acne flair up. BEWARE if you have cystic acne.
7009,Bearschick28,1,09-Jun-16,44 people found this helpful,I ve been using Clinique s Moisture Surge for a while now and I love it. However  it s very expensive! Saw the commercial for this and thought it looked very similar. I would say it s basically the same product. I love this as much as I do the Clinique brand and it costs less than 1/2 of what I was paying. I have slightly oily skin and this absorbs quickly so your skin doesn t feel greasy. Does a great job!
7010,Sarah,1,19-Sep-17,One person found this helpful,I really like this product. I have pretty oily skin that still needs its daily hydration. Cream moisturizers make my face far too oily. Someone suggested that I try a gel moisturizer instead. While I still end up with a  glow  towards the end of the day  it is nowhere what it was when I used the cream ones.
7011,ITCS,1,24-Jun-17,One person found this helpful,Don t know much about the product  but my wife demanded it. When she finds a product she likes  she demands it and no other. The big box store no longer has it  so I have to buy it online. When momma ain t happy  ain t nobody gonna be happy.
7012,Krys D,1,15-Feb-17,One person found this helpful,My favorite daily facial cream. It s a water based gel with hydraulic acid in it. It s freshening  replenishes  and is not oily AT ALL. And a little goes a long way. Will never use another product
7013,Laura Zennie,1,07-Dec-15,,This moisturizer leaves skin surprisingly soft. It is light and no greasy. I have super sensitive skin with rosacea and this does not cause a flare up as it is gentle enough to use with my sensitive skin. I would recommend for anyone with sensitive skin. The subscribe and save option is a plus to save money.
7014,Patrice Turner,1,24-Mar-15,,When I received the product I was surprised by the small size. But big things do come in small packages. This 1.7 oz gel will last me for a while  You don t need to use a lot. It s smooth. It s like giving your skin a drink of water. I love the product and the results. Buy it!
7015,JEM,1,20-Feb-15,2 people found this helpful,So far so good. I finished the jar. (It lasted for about a month). It really hydrates my skin. It replaced my high priced Hydramucine Creme. The only drawback is that I still have to use another cream that has spf. But my skin is moistured and smooth which says a lot because we are in the middle of an ARCTIC Winter.
7016,Linda Gallo,1,06-Oct-15,One person found this helpful,This is the first time I tried this moisturizer and I love it. It soothes and coolsmy skin. Use it daily in themorning and my skin still feels soft and dewy in the evening. I ll continue to buy it and use it - my new  must have. 
7017,itsyanami,1,12-Dec-17,,made me break out at first  but after a couple of weeks of use  it became one of the favorites. It s lightweight  moisturizing. You can feel light tickles for a minute right after you apply it because it has Hyaluronic acid. I think that it s a good sign.
7018,Rebecca,1,26-Jun-17,,Literally the best day time facial moisturizer I have ever used. It s so light and just glides on and soaks in immediately  no greasy feel  no having to wait minutes for it to soak in. One jar lasts me months  because it only takes a few tiny dabs around your face for full coverage. I have fairly dry non-oily skin so usually my face feels tight itchy and dry half way through the day  but not with this stuff! I will forever buy it!
7019,Ashley,1,18-May-16,,I have combination skin that is very sensitive. This is a nice  lightweight moisturizer  and it absorbs quickly. It feels very clean on my face and doesn t make me break out or irritate my skin like other moisturizers. I like to use it at night after washing my face.
7020,Anna Carlsson,1,19-Jan-17,One person found this helpful,Starting to get a few little areas of wrinkling in your skin  especially with a lot of sun exposure  used this  then spray Vaseline moisturizer over it. Your skin will look years younger.
7021,Kim,1,31-Jan-17,,I love how easily it goes on and how lightly  but I was hoping for more hydration throughout the day. Or even a few hours. Maybe I ll love it more in the summer but I don t think this is my go-to for the long term.

It does feel fresh and cool when it goes on but it doesn t do anything else The product says it has hylauronic acid in it but it doesn t say how much and I now suspect that this is the problem. If it had any measurable amount of HA  then they would tell us. A friend got me another product from Amazon that has a good amount of HA and it is amazing. Don t waste your money on this.

7078,Samantha Mine,0,06-Jul-15,22 people found this helpful,I do have sensitive skin. This product states it is for all skin types and is non comedogenic (won t cause breakouts) I read about water based moisturizers in a magazine  and this particular one was mentioned  so I looked for it on Amazon.  I applied it to my forehead only  to make sure it was an OK product for me. This was prior to going to bed in the evening. The smell was strong  and reminded me of some type of  ocean breeze  scented air freshener. I did not care for that.  Once on my skin  my face felt a bit of a sting. I went to sleep and woke up with a forehead covered in bumps. A nightmare breakout! I am quite disappointed. I will have to look into returning this item.  This may work for some  but I would never want to put this on my face again. I csnnot tell if my skin is softer  as it feels too broken out to tell.
7079,Amazon Customer,0,26-May-17,5 people found this helpful,Did not read ingredients; has Blue#1 and am allergic. I gave product away.
7080,M.,0,25-Dec-17,4 people found this helpful,This stuff was awful. I was using the hydraboost serum that comes in a pump bottle but wanted to try this one since it was a better deal. I’d use the hydraboost cleansing lotion face wash then use this afterward (before bed) and it made my skin burn like stinging burn for about 3-4 min after applying. It eventually quit burning  but my skin still felt dry and tight. And it’s not like I have super sensitive skin or anything and I checked the ingredients; there’s nothing in it that I’m allergic to or that I don’t already use on a daily basis. Basic Olay moisturizer is better than this stuff. I’d maybe try this again if it was given to me  but I’ll never buy it again.
7081,Nan Watt,0,27-Feb-15,7 people found this helpful,Sodium Hydroxide is a toxic material and according to OHSA can cause serious skin conditions burning and lung problems. I am returning it for a full refund and I just received it today. Always conduct a research investigation of the product ingredients prior to purchase.
7082,Free-Bird,0,19-Nov-18,One person found this helpful,I bought this moisturizer to transition from high end products to drugstore brands. It’d been a long time since I bought a CVS moisturizer and figured I’d give one a try to cut back on monthly face product cost. I am 31 and have t-zone oil and hormonal breakouts. I have a few light wrinkles at my mouth.  This moisturizer smelled and was watery- not intensive moisuture at all. A good moisturizer will hydrate deeply without being greasy. I found this product sat on the top of my skin and I had dry patches all over my face. I ended up returning this product after a couple weeks and went to Sephora for something more suitable. Unfortunately  you do get what you pay for. This product didn’t hydrate and my skins overall health declined; dull  dry  frequent breakouts and WRINKLE PROMOTING. I do not recommend.
7083,Lovely,1,04-May-16,One person found this helpful,It s a shame that some people had bad experiences with this product  because I just absolutely love it. The first time I was going to buy it  I didn t because of the price. It was about $17 at Target. I finally decided to buy from CVS because I had a coupon for that store. I have combo skin with an oily t-zone. I tend to dry out around my inner cheeks  right near my nose  and in between my brows. I have visible pores on my nose and inner cheeks. The first few days that I used it  I could not stop touching my face lol. I just couldn t believe how soft and supple it was. I also noticed a the sensitive areas on my face where I tend to break out had calmed down. I think it was because this product really added much needed moisture to my face. If you wear makeup  there is no need to put a primer on over this. One of the main ingredients is dimethicone  which smooths the surface of your skin  which in turn helps foundation to lay better and longer. This is my new HG moisturizer. I have seen a few youtubers that compare this to higher end brand moisturizers like clinique. I can see why.
7084,Jasems,1,25-Nov-17,,This Hydro boost water gel gives my skin hydration without an overpowering layer of film sitting on my face. Previously for winter I used Clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel. I have combination  but mostly oily skin which is prone to breakouts at the age of 46. I use medication for acne  along with foundation for combo/oily skin which includes sun block. I found that the Clinique was something nice to put on before going to bed  on a twice a week basis. But when I would wake up my skin would feel like a layer of coconut oil had been placed on it while I was sleeping. This was not due to the product but how my skin reacting to it. I needed something to apply under my make up throughout the day and before going to bed. After washing my face  I apply Neutrogena Hydro boost water Gel while my skin is still wet. I only dab my finger in the gel and cover a nice thin layer over my face and neck. I may do this process twice; allowing the first layer to dry before adding a second  on drier days. After allowing the second layer of the Hydro gel to dry by then add my primer. There is a very faint fresh smell that dissipates immediately after application . The jar comes in a 1.7 oz. I purchase it at Target for anywhere between $15 and $17. Finding it here on Amazon for a more than affordable price is well worth getting shipped to me v/s getting it instantly. I purchased this item 5 1/2 months ago  and I am only half way through my jar.
7085,Amazon Customer,1,11-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,I was using (and loving!) Clinique s Moisture Surge Gel until budgetary constraints forced me to explore cheaper alternatives. Neutrogena s Hydro Boost Gel came to the rescue. Though not quite as effective as Moisture Surge  the price difference was a game changer. (The same amount of Clinique product is $39!) Hydro boost softens and plumps my aging skin  which is important as I am seeking employment. Perhaps I may switch to Clinique once my income is secure but for now  Neutrogena Hydro Boost is a viable (and affordable) alternative. I highly recommend this product.
7086,Laura Holguin,1,16-Apr-18,,Skin type: Extremely oily  sensitive  moderate breakouts  This was a random purchase for me while out of town (forgot my usual at home.) I originally only used it at night before bed but then one day decided to try it as a daytime moisturizer and what I noticed:  1. I found myself blotting less throughout the day 2. B/c my skin s oily  makeup doesn t last as long but while wearing this  my makeup STILL looked amazing at the end of the day (after 12 hours of wear) 3. My skin has been looking a lot more even and less dull after removing my makeup at the end of the day 4. I typically develop a minor rash when switching to a new product be it lotion  makeup  or soap. That did not happen with this product  Bottom line: I highly recommend this moisturizer if you have the same issues as I do  and also if you want something lightweight and unscented.
7087,Sweetwheat,1,23-Jan-18,,Yes  yes  yes!!! In conjunction with the serum  this has saved my face. Around the corners of my mouth I was experiencing very wrinkly  dry skin. My fiance and sister kept pointing it out  especially when I put on foundation  so I decided to heal myself. I found this at the CVS and after reading reviews I bought it. Now  every time I get ready to go out  I place the serum first and this product second. Then I put on sunscreen and my foundation comes last. Don t recall if this is meant to help vs wrinkles? But I do see a reduction by where my brows furrow. I know there are other products in this line  but if you don t want to spend all that money  I suggest the serum and this gel. Works great for me.
7088,Rachel P,0,24-Mar-19,,It’s just okay. I bought this product because it was recommended to me. I have oily skin and I was struggling to find a good moisturizer. I’ve tried many different types of moisturizers of all prices. This is my first gel. I use it right after I get out of the shower followed by the Tatcha water cream. Honestly I won’t be buying it again. I notice a very slight difference of less oil coming through during my day. Also I do not like the scent. I will try the Garnier gel cream next.
7089,E. B. MULLIGAN,1,02-Dec-14,One person found this helpful,ditch the dye & fragrence and you have a winner. The oil-free gel is a nice change from the light creams I use for my 50 year old fair skin. Wearable under my makeup (foundation and blush). The product looks gorgeous - so maybe as a gift from sister to sister or when you want to try a new product.  You can apply once or twice a day. After cleaning your face you can even apply a light lotion to enhance the effect of the Hydro Boost. At the end of the day you can repeat. I use a makeup sponge to apply or my finger tips when fresh from a shower.  The Hyaluronic Acid and Olive Extract moisturizes which smooths your skin and reduces the appearance of wrinkles.  What is Purified Hyaluronic acid? In prescription strength it has been used to treat skin issues like eczema. In this priduct it is listed as the 14th ingredient.  Ingrediants: water  dimethicone  glycerin  dimeticone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer  phenoxyethanol  polyacrylamide  cetearyl olivate  sorbitan olivate  dimethiconol  C13-14 isoparaffin  dimethicone crosspolymer  chlorphenesin  carbomer  laureth-7  sodium hyaluronate  ethylhexylglycerin  fragrance  C12-14 pareth-12  sodium hydroxide  blue 1
7090,Dulce L.,1,25-Jul-18,,I was on the fence about this gel cream. I heard it was great but also read a lot about it having an overpowering scent. I decided to take a chance and I have no regrets! This gel melts into your skin so quickly and it does NOT have a strong scent. It has a very light scent that I can barely smell by sticking my big nose into the jar. It leaves my skin plump and soft. I have been using serums and beauty oils with hyaluronic acid for years now. This is my first  cream  and I love it! Definitely recommend!
7091,Megan Tichonevicz,1,03-Mar-15,6 people found this helpful,Full disclosure: I received this product free for testing purposes through Influenster.com. As always  all opinions and views expressed are entirely my own.  The gel smooths easily all over your face and neck  and feels so cool and refreshing. It also dries quickly with little scent (and the scent it does have is great.) Despite its quick absorption  I can definitely feel the difference on my skin for hours. It feels so smooth and soft  not to mention the long-term effects: no more dryness or itchiness  plus a radiant glow. And I ve only been using it about a week!  Here are a couple of my favorite things about this product: -It s oil-free  lightweight  and leaves no negative effect on my skin. -The gel can be worn under makeup  so I use it after washing my face at night and in the morning before getting ready. -A little goes a long way  so I know that this jar will last me a long time!  This stuff is awesome and can be applied and dried in less than 30 seconds- which fits right into my busy schedule! I really can t wait to see more long-term results and I would 100% recommend this product to anyone who needs a healthy moisturizer. Not to mention  this is the perfect time to repair your skin from the harsh winter weather and prep it for the summer sun that will be here before you know it!
7092,Margarita,1,27-Feb-15,,I had been looking for a new moisturizer as this winter has been brutal on my skin. After some research I knew I wanted to try gel because I have oil and acne prone skin with some dry cheek patches and any time I put something creamy on it feels so heavy and greasy. I tend to slather on moisturizer heavily because if I don t I feel like it never works  so when I saw how expensive the gel moisturizers were at some high end places I just chose not to buy them. I did some searching online and found Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel and was like JACKPOT! Now here is the funny part  after I bought this for myself I was actually asked to test it (for free) by Neutrogena! Now I have two jars and will be soft skinned basically forever.  After a wash and exfoliation I rubbed in a good dollop of gel. I was worried I grabbed too much but it wasn t greasy and absorbed in my skin really really well. My skin feels clean and soft like the day after a facial. I can t stop touching my cheeks. Now it wasn t miraculous but it s a super solid daily moisturizer for the girl who doesn t want an oil slick of moisturizer under her foundation or on her pillow. Perfect for the all dreaded combination skin.
7093,Mona,0,01-Mar-19,,Neutrogena Hydro Boost feels lightweight  cool and soothing  similar to aloe gel. The jar says it  instantly quenches skin   which it does  but 2 minutes later my face feels dry. I have to use an additional moisturizer. I’ve seen this on reviews for top skincare products. I thought it would be a great lower priced substitute for Boscia Catus Water Moisturizer  which is also a lightweight gel moisturizer. I was wrong. I bought mine from target  I should have kept the receipt. 2 Stars  it doesn’t seem to moisturize better than some other drug store products  and it’s 2-3x the price.
7094,Steph,1,25-Feb-15,,I use a lot of Neutrogena products so I am not new to this brand. I have been using their facial cleanser for years and people always comment on how great my skin looks  so I didn t think there would be any problem with this product. I used this product immediately after washing my face with the facial cleaner. I absolutely love the smell  texture  lightweight and smoothness of this product. It s not sticky at all and you can t even tell its on your face once you rub it in. Unlike other products I have tried that leave my face looking oily or greasy this one doesn t! So far I love everything about this product expect that now my face is breaking out which usually happens whenever I introduce a new neutrogena product into my regimen. I think after a few more uses I will end up buying this product from now on! I also tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free thanks to Influenster  but all opinions are my own.
7095,Vera,0,15-Oct-18,2 people found this helpful,Had just finished cleaning my face and put this stuff on  instantly my face turned bright red  my eyes started watering  and my face felt like it was on fire!
7096,Danish D Abreau,0,25-Oct-18,One person found this helpful,I really had not realized HOW clean and organic I had made my skin care routine until I tried to put this on my face. It is loaded with so many artificial fragrances and chemicals   that I could actually taste it in my mouth once applied. I returned it.
7097,Sunshine,1,19-Jun-17,One person found this helpful,I bought this after purchasing the L Oreal moisturizer which was absolutely horrible. The Neutrogena hydroboost gel is like gold in a bottle! The first time I put it on my face I wanted to rub it all over my body. Absolutely in love with this stuff. It almost immediately started reducing the scaring that was left from the L Oreal moisturizer.
7098,cilla,1,03-Dec-18,,There s a review here that says this product is fake and this person put a picture comparing the color and describing the texture of the product. And I assure you this isnt a fake product  that person got the cream-gel version that is for sensitive skin  and this is the water gel version for normal to dry skin. Simply the person confused the two products.
7099,Beck,0,15-Feb-18,,I wanted to love this. I wanted it to replace the daily moisturizer I ve used practically my whole adult life  because now that I m 40 I wanted the age-defying effects it advertises. But alas  I found that just minutes after applying it  my face felt dry and I had to use another moisturizer on top of it. I shouldn t have to moisturize after moisturizing! Lol! I dont even have particularly dry skin! Maybe its because I live in a desert climate  but it just wasnt for me. It smells nice and goes on so smoothly  though.
7100,Blair McDermott,1,05-Mar-15,,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel is now my absolute favorite face product that I have in my skincare routine. It makes my skin feel extremely refreshed and hydrated. It has a light cooling effect that makes your face feel very clean. I use this at night and the hydration lasts throughout the next day. It does not make my face oily or break it out. It feels like sunshine & ocean on your face. I would highly recommend this product to EVERYONE! I even have my boyfriend using it now because it is such a great product. I no longer suffer from dry  winter skin. I was fortunate enough to receive this product for free through Influenster for my review. This review is 100% how I feel about the product and the opinions of the product are my own.
7101,Jord Soro,1,09-Dec-17,,I ve tried everything to get rid of dry flaky skin from an array of moisturizers  face masks  natural remedies  and keeping hydrated. Nothing was working. This gel is amazing! It goes on so smooth and absorbs quickly. It s not greasy and so light that it doesn t feel like anything at all is on my face. Hours after the first use there were no visible flakes in my t zone. I highly recommend this product!
7102,Barbara A. Sbrogna,1,06-Jan-17,,I have suffered from extremely dry skin my whole life and never found a cream that truly helped  except for this one! Finally  I saw results within a week or so and coudln t believe it. Absolutely no other product provided long-lasting moisturizing. I used to have to use one of those rough gloves to rub away the dry skin on my forehead  nose and cheeks. Rarely have to use that now. This was so good that it  in fact  made my t-zone area a little overly moisturized. But no complaints on that end. Just really happy to have smooth and unscaly skin.  I don t understand those who say that there was absolutely no difference to their skin. My guess is that they ve never experienced really dry skin and were just  normal . For those of you who have suffered with really dry skin  use this product!
7103,Jess Y.,0,25-Feb-18,One person found this helpful,Previously unscented/without dyes  this arrived and was both scented and dyed. It doesn’t seem to work as well as previously formulated and I do not care for the scent. I do not plan on purchasing again.
7104,Carolina E P,1,30-Mar-19,,I really like this product. It has a super light feel  the gel is refreshing on the face  and since I use mines at night  I wake up with a clean moisturized but not oily face. My skin feels softer too. For the price I think it’s great!
7105,艾?,1,06-Jan-18,,Best moisturizer ever!! I have insane dry shara desert type skin and using this just makes my face look divine! I’m on my fourth jar use it morning and night as I do wash my face morning and night. It is a great moisturizer especially if you have extremely dry skin. I used it when I was in Vegas for edc even caught my boyfriend stealing some. Kept me moisturized in 114 degree weather  now I have normal skin.
7106,Kristina226,1,15-Feb-19,,This product is a staple in my beauty routine. It is silky smooth  leaves my face feeling plumped and also it helps to rebuild collagen because of the hyaluronic acid. You can’t beat the price Dash and for me  it’s very similar to Clinique’s.
7107,Josh,0,03-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,The worst moisturizer I ve ever used. It caused pimple after pimple. (Splurge and get Clinique turnaround over night. I m about to try a Murad moisturizer but I can t say yes or not on that one yet.)
7108,erica beth,1,12-Mar-15,,I recently received the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel to test free for free. I have had dry skin my entire life  so of course I was hesitant about another product. Finding a product that helps with moisture is never easy. Here are my own personal thoughts on the product. From the moment I opened the container I knew I would love the product. I wish I could bottle the smell as a perfume. It smells amazing!! It smells like a day spa. I also love how it feels on my face. It s light  but has a nice cooling  moisturizing feeling. I definitely recommend this product for people with dry skin.
7109,Bronte,1,03-Jan-19,,I love this. I have sensitive and oily/combination skin and this worked wonders for me. It leaves me feeling super moisturized without feeling oily and after doing my makeup after putting it on my face looks smooth as a baby’s butt.
7110,Cariad,1,11-Jul-18,,I started using this about 3 months ago because my Dermatologist told me to use it. I told him I needed a good moisturizer and wanted to know what he recommended. I ve been very happy with it. I have dry skin and this absorbs so beautifully. I m very happy with it.
7111,Ohmy,1,17-Nov-16,,I have only used this product once so far  but it sure is impressive. It comes in a wonderful scent and glides on effortlessly. It absorbs quickly and gives you a fresh primered look.  I am not sure how much I was supposed to use because my face just kept absorbing every layer I put on. It would be good to know since there s so little in each container.
7112,Kaitlyn Rudolph,1,12-Mar-15,,This product is amazing! I did receive this product for free to try through influenster  but all these opinions are my own. I have dry to normal skin and am incredibly picky about how moisturizers dry on my skin. I can t stand if they do not dry completely or leave any sort of residue. The Neutrogena Hydro Boost does not do that! It dries completely in seconds and leaves me skin feeling incredibly soft and smooth. I have been using the product for a little over a week and have seen a noticeable improvement in my skin. I can t wait to try the other products in this line!
7113,Care,1,13-Mar-15,,I received this full size jar of Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel free for testing purposes from Influenster.  I m very grateful to have received this product as I was well and beyond ready to sluff off my dry winter skin. Especially on my nose and cheeks where my glasses caused dry spots and flaking. (Gross  I know) I tested this product for one week before deciding to do a proper review.  Honestly  I didn t have much hope for the Water Gel  I couldn t really wrap my mind around how something so thin could  boost  my dry face  but being completely honest it did wonders. I spread a thin layer (A little goes a very long way) on my entire face after a shower or a washing and let it sit before applying my regular daily slathering of paint and prettiness. I was extremely happy that after the Gel dried I couldn t even tell I had put it on. Unlike many (many) lotions I ve tried to heal my face there was no sticky or tacky residue  no medicine smell  just a smooth face.  Granted  it didn t work over night and I don t know if anything other than good ole summer sun will really help my dry nose but this really did amazing work.  I was  however  sad to see the $29 price tag on Amazon  which unfortunately I could never spring for being a family lady  that for me is lunch for the family or other such adult bill type situations  but I would love to test out their other products. I think I would honestly splurge and treat myself if the cost was a bit less  or I had a nice coupon.  I HIGHLY recommend this product for your dry bits. I am  have always been  and will always be a Neutrogena (and Influenster) fan girl.  Happy Beautifying ladies.
7114,M. Evans,0,09-Mar-15,4 people found this helpful,My first impression was that the  water gel  is definitely more water than gel  it has kind of a runny consistency which made me hesitant because thicker products are usually more hydrating in my experience. The second thing that I noticed was the scent  this product has a clean scent that almost reminds me of laundry detergent or a clean linen scent  which I love... but not on my face. The blue color was also somewhat off putting because I m not a fan of added dyes to skin care products  they don t seem to irritate me (they can for some people) but it just seems unnecessary.  When I used this product (on a fresh clean face of course) it immediately absorbed into my skin and felt very light  not greasy and had a semi matte finish. After about 5-10 minutes my skin feels like the product is completely absorbed and gone and my face starts to get that tight dry feeling like I never put anything on it. I tried using this moisturizer several times and always ended with the same result I needed something heavier on top to keep my skin hydrated for more than 10 minutes. I tend to love products with hyaluronic acid but after checking the ingredients list and seeing how far down on this list HA was in this product  15 out of 20 (just slightly above fragrance  and the blue dyes)  I m not surprised my skin didn t really feel its effects.  I was sent this product to review  opinions are my own.
7115,Julissa Rodriguez,1,04-Mar-15,,My skin loves this moisturizer! It absorbs quickly and locks in moisture all day long. My skin usually absorbs my moisturizer and makeup very quickly. Now I have a new morning routine. I rinse my face with lukewarm water  then apply the hydro boost water gel and then all my makeup. I now have this awesome glow and my skin looks replenished without feeling oily. My other issue is dry skin in the morning. I apply the hydro boost water gel at night and wake up with a great glow and my skin feels smooth and not oily at all.  I don t dislike the fragance but I could do without it. It smells clean but I can smell it for a while.  I tested the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel for free.

7117,Editor of Lillian s Diaries,1,10-Dec-14,One person found this helpful,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel gives you a pleasant little tingle when you first put it on your face and/or neck. The gel absorbs quickly and immediately removes that stretched and tight feeling of dryness felt by those of us weathering winter in the Midwest. Your face will feel soft and nourished for about 6 hours with little or no feeling of stickiness. I have been using it twice a day....first thing when I wake up and right before bedtime and am very pleased.
7118,Sarah F.,1,22-May-16,,This is the perfect stand-alone moisturizer for combination/oily skin. If your skin is dry  it might not work. It is perfect for me because I used to skip moisturizer in the morning (and just use my sunscreen). My skin suffered for it  but everything I tried for daytime was too greasy feeling for me. I can layer this under my sunscreen and it s just right.
7119,Alixe Ingoglia,0,26-Mar-15,2 people found this helpful,I was super excited to try this! I love Neutrogena s products  and have used their cleansers and moisturizers for years. Upon opening the package  I immediately got the product all over my hands - it is not exactly gel  but almost a thick liquid! The smell is next to nonexistent  so good thing for sensitive noses and skins  but next was the application. I used barely a pea size and it felt as though it would never soak in! I have usually combination skin  but by the end of the day my skin is dry and almost scaly - and I ve begun to break out on my temples and forehead. Usually my chin is the problem spot  but for some reason this Gel isn t sitting well with me. I m bummed  because I really love the products normally but I ll have to give this one the boot. I received the Hydro Boost from Influenster VoxBox to try and review for free  but wasn t given anything to say - this is just my opinion!
7120,Mat633,1,06-Dec-14,One person found this helpful,Having dry skin during winter can be frustrating because most moisturizers make the face more or less oily and if you are at a party where your picture is taken  you end up with a shiny face in the picture.  This Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel solves the problem. You get the moisture and hydration you need for your skin without the oily result.  I wish the portion is a little more generous. However  I recommend it!
7121,Amazon Customer,1,07-Jan-18,,LOVE this gel. I have super dry skin and applying this nightly has drastically improved the texture and smoothness of my face. It is not greasy and is absorbed well into the face. Will wear sometimes during day under make up with no problem.
7122,Amber Gardner,1,17-Aug-17,,i have wanted to try this stuff since it came out but was always hesitant cuz it was 20 bucks. it was on sale at walmart one day for 16 so i decided to give it a try. and i love this! love the smell and it goes on so smooth. you i just dab my fingers a couple times and that s enough for my face and neck. will def buy again!
7123,S. Wilson,1,07-Apr-18,,This lotion keeps the promise of being a hydro boost. I use it on days where I don’t put on any make up and I love the way it makes my skin feel. I can definitely tell it hydrates it better than my regular day lotion.
7124,Dana,0,09-May-18,One person found this helpful,My dermatologist recommended this product and it seems to be an OK moisturizer  but it is too heavily perfumed and so unpleasant to use.
7125,Sarada,1,25-Jan-18,,Using this moisturizer feels like you’re putting water into your skin. That’s the only way I can describe how hydrating this stuff is. I’ve had a big problem with dry skin and I’ve been trying everything and this is by far the winner. Skin is softer with no flakeness. I love the smell  and it’s so refreshing when you apply it. I actually look forward to using this product every night.
7126,Amazon Customer,1,01-Jun-17,,I use this product at night before bed since it doesn t have spf and I wake up with the softest skin. I have an oily forehead and dry  red cheeks that get flaky sometimes and this has definitely helped to moisturize my skin. I no longer have the flakiness and I see my redness starting to minimize. I am very happy with this product. I only wish there was a bigger size.
7127,pearl38,1,13-Mar-19,,This cream is amazing. A little goes a long way. It glides on so nice and makes your skin feel silky/soft. Love it!
7128,NYCMartini,1,11-Mar-15,8 people found this helpful,I was wary of trying this product as Neutrogena products in the past have irritated my skin and eyes. Well they must have changed their formula because this is amazing. I love this product. It is so hydrating but so light. This winter  as we all know  has been brutal in the East Coast so this has really kept my skin from getting dried out. I have been using this product for 2 weeks and this may replace my current Olay moisturizer. It does not feel heavy at all on my skin and blends seamlessly with my makeup. I love the packaging and the blue tint to the product. It has a light fresh scent which I surprisingly like as I really don t like fragrances in my facial skin care products. Overall this product is fabulous. The only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 was because  as I previously stated  I am not a fan of fragrances in facial skin care products.  I received this product for free for testing purposes but my opinions are my own.
7129,Sweet Tea,1,06-Dec-14,6 people found this helpful,There were a number of things I liked about this product. It is a very lightweight  gel-type moisturizer. It was very easy to apply to my face and spread very easily. I felt it did an adequate job of moisturizing and softening my skin. I don t have particularly dry skin and my forehead tends to be oily. What I really liked about this moisturizer is that it actually seemed to help the oiliness of my forehead. At the very least  it didn t make it worse and this was a first for me. Anything I apply to my forehead seems to make it more oily.  Another plus is the size of the container; it is large and hold a lot of the moisturizer. One jar of this stuff should last quite a while.  I didn t detect any funny or offensive odor which can bother some people.  Over all a good  basic moisturizer.
7130,asiu,1,23-Oct-18,,this is practically miracle gel… i apply it in the mornings and evenings and it almost immediately makes my skin supple and soft
7131,Aggie,1,03-Mar-15,,I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free  but all opinions are my own...  I was not expecting much when I received this moisturizer  But I am so glad I got to try this item!! I have tried sooo many moisturizers and none have really helped with my dry skin. I thought that it being water-based it wasnt going to do much. I was wrong! This leaves my skin so soft! I love using it in the morning before I go to work or a few minutes before I put my makeup on. I highly recommend this  I will definitely buy this on my own!
7132,Momof2,1,12-Mar-19,,Tried this moisturizer as a sample product and have been hooked ever since. A little goes a long way and keeps skin balanced and moisturized. It smells lovely too!
7133,Bamboo,1,14-Jan-18,,This product is prefect. I’ve been searching for a water/gel product that truly hydrates my skin yet doesn’t leave a shiny look. It really does pump your skin a little bit and as you’re applying it you feel your face being refreshed and supple. I don’t know what I would do if this was to be discontinued.
7134,V,0,24-Feb-15,7 people found this helpful,I really wanted to like this product  but I m not sure it s enough for my extreme dry skin. I need something that is oil based. But that is my preference.  Overall  I m disappointed in the jar packaging  which leads to the breakdown of ingredients. It s also very unhygienic. And the addition of fragrance in this product is so unnecessary. Fragrance is no skincare. A great concept  but poorly executed.  *This product was provider to me for free for testing purposes and all opinions are my own.
7135,Liz T.,1,10-Feb-15,One person found this helpful,This is hands down the best moisturizer I ve ever used. I tend to shy away from moisturizers because I have oily acne prone skin  but some of the acne products I use will create rough patches. The first day I used this I couldn t stop touching my face because it was so soft. It wasn t greasy or heavy at all. It soaked right in and smelled wonderful. Almost like an ocean type scent that s very faint. By the third day or so my skins condition improved quite a bit. The pores were looking much smaller and my face just had a natural glow. It also looked less tired and sunken in around the eyes. I simply cannot say enough about this.
7136,Valerie Cook,1,24-Feb-15,,This lotion is very light and airy once on. It soaks up easily and leaves behind a soft feel. It s almost like putting baby powder on your skin so that it s soft but not greasy. I m definitely sold on this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who is in the market for a moisturizer that is worth your time  effort  and money!  I had the opportunity to test Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free from Influenster  but all of the opinions are my own.
7137,ThereCameThisWoman,1,18-Mar-15,,I love how this product feels on my skin - it really moisturizes it well and it has a very mild scent that I love. I have always been challenged with moisture retention. Needless to say  I was very happy to get a chance to try this product. It truly helped with the dry patches on some parts of my face - specially on some parts of my nose and around my eye area.  I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless  I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I?€™m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user?€™s standpoint.
7138,honest_t,0,08-May-18,One person found this helpful,contains fragrance and blue artificial coloring and nothing that seems like it is good for you beyond the HA.. grooosss....don t want those toxic nasties slathering my skin! especially since there is virtually no regulation of cosmetic products in our country thanks to the current administration s lack of accountability for companies and terrible new EPA hires. another cheaply made bad-for-you product from neutrogena. by the way  there are so many other more natural products that contain the popular hyaluronic acid at the same price! be smart  go natural. your skin will thank you!
7139,spencer marrow,1,14-Oct-18,,Love this produce. Use it every other day after shower and before work.
7140,Cheryl Kollek,1,13-Oct-17,,NICE LIGHT moisturizer  I have combination skin  and this is nice  moisturizes without the oil to clog pours!
7141,Becky,1,23-Feb-15,,Tried this out today  it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. Very lightweight. And my skin feels instantly hydrated! Soft too! No strong fragrance. I wonder about *some* of the ingredients  prefer all natural  but it really makes my skin feel great! I got to try it for free  but be ensured my review is completely honest! I recommend it esp in the winter time!
7142,NiseyyD,1,19-Mar-15,,I received the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel to test and review. At first I thought it was a face cleanser  but it is actually a moisturizer. I’ve been using Clinique’s Dark Spot Corrector and a SPF Moisturizer for my daily routine but decided to try this after an evening shower since I didn’t need to worry about needing SPF. It has a nice clean scent  although personally I don’t like putting scented stuff on my face as I always worry it’ll negatively affect me. Luckily it didn’t. This was definitely very moisturizing and felt much more lightweight than I was expecting based on what it looked/felt like. Even though this is a facial moisturizer  my legs have been peeling from a sunburn so I decided to use it on them too and I really liked how it worked. Granted  this product is a little pricey to be using all over my body. If this product had SPF in it  I could see it replacing my current daily moisturizer.  Disclosure: This complementary item was received for review purposes. All opinions are my own and no compensation was received.
7143,Jamie10,1,27-Aug-15,5 people found this helpful,I have been using this for about two weeks and it is amazing so far. I have very oily skin  and I love how this product does not leave a sticky  greasy feeling on my face. It absorbs so fast and it feels so smooth. My face doesn t look shiny afterwards and it doesn t feel like I have any actual product on my face  which I love. Overall  this has been amazing for me  especially during the summer!
7144,Esau Hernandez,1,06-Jan-19,,Love this one! I apply it before my make up and leaves my skin hydrated.
7145,paris_06,1,03-Mar-15,66 people found this helpful,i have been using this for the past week now an my skin is in love with it you cn use it day or night or when ever it smells great an it not leave your skin feeling sticky like most face products. its easy to use just apply with your finger tips an your good to go.within mins of putting it on you can feel the difference in you skin . I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free  but all opinions are my own.
7146,AlextheCat,1,05-Nov-18,,Very moisturizing  definately saw a difference in my skin almost right away. Fragrance a little heavy.
7147,flutek,1,15-Feb-18,,Makes your skin feel super soft and springy. My skin isn t dry and it doesn t irritate it at all. Absorbs fast and is great under makeup.
7148,Lindsay M.,1,03-Jan-15,,Love this gel! It smells great  goes on without leaving any film/residue  and feels so refreshing. This is perfect for the cold weather  when my skin gets dry and chapped easily--I just put this on after a shower and after washing my face and it lasts for the entire day. I will definitely be picking this up again once this jar runs out.
7149,lindsey murray,1,01-Mar-15,,I m absolutely loving Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel! I did recieve it complementary for testing purposes however my love for this product is 100% real! I ve never found a moisturizer that doesn t leave my skin at least slightly greasy  but this one does not at all! My skin feels hydrated and refreshed  without any heavy or greasy feeling. The scent is light and fresh and really makes you feel pampered when using it. I m definitely a huge fan and will be buying another jar once this one runs out!  P.S. I ve had to keep it hidden from my husband bc he loves it too!
7150,Reeselm,1,07-Mar-15,,I was given this product to review from Influenster - opinions are my own. I ve been using this for a couple days  both morning and night. I have moderately dry skin. It is great to apply right before applying foundation; really nice base. However  I don t think it s hydrating enough to use at night. My skin is still pretty dry when I wake up. Bottom line: this is a great pre-makeup moisturizer. Find something else for your night cream
7151,Juju,1,03-Mar-15,,I ve been using Neutrogena products from acne on the spot to sunscreen lotions since I was a teenager. I got a chance to try the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel and it has so many pros: affordable  easy to use  refreshing with a light fragrance  lightweight to easily absorb in the face and neck -- keeps the skin hydrated & smooth  and oil-free (won t leave a  film  on your face or make you feel greas). I would recommend mainly for spring/summer time.
7152,Ashley,1,24-Mar-15,,I ve been using the Hydro Boost Water Gel for about two weeks now. My skin is typically oily  yet still dry in some areas due to be in the sun a lot. I have been looking for something to use at night that would help with the dryness  yet not make me even more oily or cause a breakout issue. So far I have noticed a huge difference in my skin. The dry spots are going away and I m not breaking out like crazy  wooohoo!!! I put this on at night after a shower. It s super light and a little goes a LONG way. It goes on nice and smooth and doesn t feel heavy or make me feel  dirty . I wash it off in the morning and carry on with my normal routine. I was sent Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel for free  but all opinions are mine. When I finish this jar I WILL be buying another!
7153,AmazonPrimeAddict,1,03-May-16,One person found this helpful,I will never go back to a normal moisturizer! It works! Period. I use morning and night  on my face and neck. It absorbs very quickly and is fine under makeup. You will love it!
7154,linbin,1,23-Mar-15,2 people found this helpful,The Beauty of this gel is that you can apply is as base and it makes yours feel hydrated  and when you apply your regular moisturizer on top  it does not feel like it is too much.  I recently was in warmer weather and I can honestly say that this item saved me from peeling as much i typically would have otherwise. Since I also live in cold weather and since winter does not seem to want to go away... i did notice that it help keep my skin more hydrated than if i used my moisturizer alone. It is a lightweight skin product that does what it says is does  and it makes you feel more hydrated. It is strongly advised that you accompany this product with your regular moisturizer.
7155,Millennial in debt,1,02-Mar-15,One person found this helpful,I received the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel From the Influenster Vox Box for free for review. I like this product alot. It is refreshing and moisturizing without being too heavy  cakey or leaving behind a filmy residue. However I have two complaints that keep it from being a 5 star. There is no SPF so I dont think it provides enough coverage to be an amazing day time moisturizer and there is no salic acid for night time moisturizing to prevent acne. Other than that great moisturizer that needs a bit of accompaniment.
7156,justviasyl,1,04-Jun-15,,I use it at night as a moisturizer before I go to bed after washing my face and applying some toner. It has a subtle  delightful fragrance and it really smoothes and moisturizes my face. It leaves it feeling super clean and healthy feeling. I ve been having dry skin recently  and it does a good job of keeping my face hydrated.
7157,Kanishk Rastogi,1,14-Dec-14,,Great facial cleansing product by Neutrogena again. I have a combination skin that tends to get dry in the winters in the cheek area. Using the HydroBoost water gel was great for both the dry and oily area. It gave it enough  hydro boost  that lasted for 4-5 hours.
7158,L Drummond,1,07-Sep-16,,A daily staple. I have used for over a year before my makeup every day. My skin demands the moisture in the dry climate where I live and this product always delivers.
7159,Samantha,1,24-Feb-15,,This product is incredible! From the second I opened the package I was in love with the scent. It smells so fresh and clean. I applied a thin layer after washing my face and it sunk into my skin so nicely. I was a little weary being it is water based but I really like it. It is refreshing and makes your skin feel silky!  *This product was provided to me for free through Influenster for review and all opinions are my own.
7160,BusyWorkingMom,1,07-Apr-18,,I love this stuff. I didn’t even buy it off Amazon but felt compelled to write a review. It really makes my skin feel smooth  hydrated  and it feels great to apply.
7161,Lisa Schensted,1,03-Dec-14,,I ve been using this Hydro Boost Water Gel all over my face (not the eyes  of course) for about a week now  2x a day  in the bitter cold of Minnesota in the winter. I can tell you that it moisturizes without leaving a film or greasy feel. It rubs in smoothly (since it s a water gel  I imagine) and has a GREAT smell  too!  In the driest  coldest weather I experience  this has been a perfectly hydrating product. My face feels clean and smooth and it makes me very happy to have this on hand for the rest of the winter!
7162,Carol,0,08-Dec-17,,I ve bought this several times and has always left my face dry and flakey.
7163,Courtney Val,1,26-Mar-15,,I have been using this product 1-2 times daily for about 3.5 weeks and I think it works well to provide light hydration to my skin. This is going to be a great moisturizer for the Summer months. This product did not clog my pores or cause a breakout. I love that it has Hyaluronic Acid in it. I think this product could be improved by packaging it in a squeeze tube. I don t like having to stick my fingers back in the jar each time. I think it wastes product and a little bit of this gel moisturizer goes a very long way. I also used this on my neck and chest. I loved how soft it made the back of my neck and chest. The smell is also very nice and fresh. I would recommend this for anyone looking for lightweight hydration. I was sent this product to test for free but these opinons are completely my own and I am always 100% honest in my reviews.
7164,Vyshtia,0,30-Nov-14,10 people found this helpful,I ve been using Hyaluronic Acid Serums and they have replaced all my other moisturizers. They are the best because they go on clean  don t clog pores  don t have excess fragrances  absorb quickly  feed my skin  leaves no residue  and lightens my dark spots all in one. I was excited to try this product and was severely disappointed.  This does not have much in common with the hyaluronic serums I ve been using. It s thicker than serum  has blue coloring  has a stronger (yet pleasant fragrance)  and leaves a residue on my hands. It s very  very slight - but it s there. The slippery residue on my hands takes about 10 minutes to go away. It does do a good job moisturizing  but I really prefer the clean serums over this product that has extra chemicals in it like the blue coloring and the fragrance.  The packaging is nice and the jar is very pretty with it s light  clear blue appearance. But it s an open jar that you dip into to get the product. Other products that I ve bought that came in jars  they supplied a little plastic scoop of some sort so that you don t have to use your finger to dip into the product. This one does not supply that. So unless you have a little scoop  you will have to resort to using your fingers. Make sure your hands are clean  otherwise you can contaminate the product! LOL Maybe I m the only one that thinks of these things - it s probably not a big deal to most people - but I figured it was worth mentioning.  I definitely prefer my serums and would not recommend this product over them. If you re used to heavy  cream moisturizers with artificial coloring and fragrances - this would seem to be a nice  light moisturizer in comparison.
7165,azadeh,1,06-Jan-18,,Best moisturizer that i ever owned  better than the expensive brands. Very light weight and fast absorbing product. I recommend it to everyone. All skin types
7166,Angela Venice,1,01-Mar-15,,This product looks  smells and feels amazing! The packaging is lovely as well. I tried it today after washing my face using my face brush and Neutrogena clear pore cleanser. My skin drank it up! My face was smooth and felt like silk! Would definitely recommend this to others and can t wait to see how continued perfects my skin. Thanks to @influenster @influenstervoxbox and @neutrogena for sending me this product! #BehindTheGlow #neutrogena #contest
7167,Auntie Annie,1,01-Dec-14,,I have only used this product for two nights so far  but I love the way it feels on my skin. No grease. No feeling of a coating. It goes on smoothly and easily and leaves your skin feeling clean. I plan to buy more of this product; it is the best I have used.
7168,Elise Brockman,1,16-Aug-15,,This is my all time favorite moisturizer! I have dry very acne prone skin. This suffering feels and smells amazing! When my skin gets dry and flaky this stuff helps it go back to normal over night! Since using this my skin has less breakouts and is incredibly soft! Softer than my skin has been in a long long time!
7169,Tamara R.,1,08-Oct-17,,I love this! I have oily skin  but this makes my skin feel so soft  but not oily. I can tell a difference in my skin just from the short amount of time that I have used it. I will definitely be purchasing this product again!
7170,bezoarrn,1,05-Dec-14,160 people found this helpful,Update June 2015: I have continued using this product since my initial review in December  and now I have seen an improvement in fine lines and wrinkles. This product has definitely lived up to its promises with continued use.  *******************************  I m pleased with the performance of Neutrogena s Hydro Boost Water Gel. Although I don t find it does much to reverse fine facial lines and wrinkles  it does help my skin feel very soft and smooth. It also reduces the tightness of my dry skin so that my face feels more comfortable.  Within five minutes of application  I feel a noticeable difference in my skin texture. My face becomes soft  smooth  and the itchy dryness disappears. This lasts for several hours. The roughness on my cheeks is totally gone. Gone!  The texture is light  somewhere between a gel and a cream. It is not stiff or gooey like a typical gel  and it does not feel greasy like a cream. I ve never used anything quite like it. It doesn t take much  and it dissolves completely within minutes. I love that there is no sticky residue and that it does not leave my skin shiny. My face  breathes  through it and does not get sweaty with minimal activity as with all other creams.  One of the unexpected benefits that I absolutely love is the effect on makeup application. I use a cream to powder one step compact  and if I use Hydro Boost first  it glides on smoothly and stays fresher throughout the day. No more dry or flaky powder patches. As I ve aged I ve noticed that foundations and powders tend to accentuate in my lines and wrinkles instead of covering them. Using Hydro Boost prevents this from happening. Maybe it is plumping them up a bit. Somehow it prevents the makeup from settles into the wrinkles and reduces the  Grand Canyon  affect.  My skin is sensitive  and I have to be careful what I use. Although I feel a very slight tingle when using this product  I ve had no adverse affects.  I only have one gripe: why use colors and fragrances? I understand that the blue color reminds one of water  and it is a lovely shade  especially encased in the crystal clear blue glass container  but why add unnecessary coloring to such a great product? Also while the fragrance is very faint and vaporizes almost instantly when applied  why add it? The scent is vaguely familiar and pleasantly light  but again  totally unnecessary. I can barely detect faint notes of almond but am not sure of the rest. The combination of the light blue color and the pleasing scent is relaxing  so it fulfills its marketing purpose. I just would prefer they were not there.
7171,LS29,1,02-Mar-15,,I really enjoy this product. It s lightweight and doesn t feel like there is any residue left on my skin. I ve been using it at night and in the morning before putting on my makeup. It makes my skin soft and take away dryness before making my make up application easier  I tested this product for free  but the opinions are solely my own.
7172,ppatel,1,15-Mar-15,,I was sent this product to test out from Influenster and I m really glad I got to try it out. The Neutrogena Hydroboost water gel is a gel moisturizer that claims to instantly quench skin and provide moisture day after day. It contains hyaluronic acid  olive extract  and glycerin. Upon first use  the moisturizer is very wet feeling. It does take a few seconds to really absorb into the skin. While its absorbing  it leaves the skin feeling cool and refreshed. After it is fully absorbed  you don t feel it at all (some gel moisturizers still feel sticky). I have combination oily skin so I m not sure that this will be all that beneficial in the summer months but it was definitely a godsend for my dryer skin in the winter.I was sent this product to test for free from Influenster but all opinions of the product are my own.
7173,Katie Woodward,1,23-Mar-15,,I have very dry skin  and usually I have to choose between either letting it stay dry or letting it feel greasy by applying coconut oil in abundance -- up until now  that was the only thing that would relieve my dry skin. I received this gel to test (for free)  and I ll admit  I was skeptical at first. Having tried other similar products by different brands (who shall remain nameless)  I didn t expect this product to be any different. I was wrong. This gel actually alleviated my dry skin  without leaving an oily or filmy residue. It also left my skin feeling refreshed and hydrated. And unlike other brands  Neutrogena Hydro Boost actually smells good -- it doesn t have a chemical smell  but rather it has a light  pleasing aroma. If you have dry skin  give this product a try. It s definitely worth the price.
7174,Lisa W.,1,25-May-18,,Amazing product. It does everything it says; matifying  moisturizing  and not sticky at all! Great for summer time and for oily or combination skin!
7175,New Girl,1,05-Mar-15,,Wow! This stuf feels amazing and fixed my super dry face from the brutal WI winter. I use it at night and my dry spots are gone after 4 nights. I d prefer scent free but I don t mind the light scent. I might try for day use but it doesn t have any sunscreen. Try it!!
7176,AshleyCupcake,1,08-Nov-17,,This moisturizer is so hydrating. It goes on so creamy and smooth. My skin was left feeling supple and velvety. No greasy after feel. I’ll never use another moisturizer. Look no further!

7178,arianelor,1,06-Mar-15,,Hydro Boost water gel has become my absolute favorite! I use it immediately after I shower & it makes my face feel so silky smooth. I love it. It is not too thick or too watery. It is light weight & smells so refreshing. It is a great product for the winter  so I think it will be equally amazing in the Summer. (I was given this product complimentary but review is of my own true opinion)
7179,Kami,0,09-Jun-19,,Not the real product. Disappointed.
7180,indu,1,20-Mar-15,,Love.. Love .. Love.. this product. If you have normal to oily skin and looking something that makes your face fresh without that flimsy feeling of other moisturizers  then this is the one. My face breaks out very easily but after switching to Hydro Boost  I have zero break out. I love this product. Super gel  goes inside the skin so fast and makes it dewy fresh. Of course  gels are not for dry skin and using it on dry skin in winter will require other products as well.
7181,Judy,1,06-Mar-15,,I love the way it makes my skin feel...soft and hydrated. I also love the smell. It s light and reminds me of my Nana who always put lotions on her face and she had beautiful skin  even at 90 years old.

7195,Jessica,1,13-Mar-15,,I received this as part of Influenster & I honestly wasn t expecting to like it. I have sensitive skin & not a lot of products agree with me. However  this is one that I really like! It feels so good on my skin & really feels like it s giving my skin some serious love in the moisture department!
7196,BruisedUpDollieNails,1,13-Mar-15,One person found this helpful,New favorite! Super hydrating  fast absorbing  non oily  leaves skin smooth and hydrated. Smells lovely. Can t say enough good things! It s wonderful. I recieved this product compliments of Influenster for review purposes.
7197,Ashley R.,1,17-Mar-15,,I was given this free for the purpose of review by Influenster. The entire two weeks I ve been testing it  I ve also been sick with bronchitis  and my skin is hardly showing the signs you d expect from not only being sick  but being on a strong antibiotic. In fact  my skin has never felt softer or more hydrated!
7198,kari reed,1,13-Mar-15,,I got this as a free sample via influenster to test. I really enjoyed it! I thought it was very light  but lasted a long time. It is more liquid than other lotions (because it s a gel) and I accidentally spilled some the first time I opened it (which was my fault)  so be careful!
7199,Luke Chavez,1,18-Jul-15,,Wow straight from the gods! Idk how I ve lived my life without this product!
7200,Deskar05,0,25-Feb-15,25 people found this helpful,I received this product for free to test from Influenster. At first I was so excited to try it given it is such a high value product  but I have to say that it has not lived up to my standards. First off  I have to say when it comes to skin care I am very particular about what I put on my face. I like natural products. I typically either use Argan or Tsubaki oil as a moisturizer on my face  which tends to be VERY dry in the winter and combination in the summer. My first impression of this product was that it was very thin. And my second  almost immediate impression was the heavy fragrance. It smelled literally like someone s (bad) perfume. I don t know why skincare companies have to put fragrance in their face products. If I were to use this in the morning and then eat breakfast all I can taste is the perfume from this product. The thin consistency is due to its water based formula that is packed full of dimethicone - which is a silicone and kind of sits on top of your skin and doesn t get absorbed. For instance  silicones in hair products are bad because they cause build up. I was wary of these silicones and did not like the slick texture of this product. Additionally  it has Blue dye No. 1. Why? Why would Neutrogena put a synthetic dye in a face product? There is absolutely no need for that. When I used the product on freshly cleaned skin it did absorb but did not leave my skin feeling hydrated. In fact  you could still see some dry patches on it. I think that even though I did not particularly like this product  that someone with very oily skin would find it nice to use as a light moisturizer. For me  something with the word  hydro  in it should definitely have been more hydrating than it is. I think that Neutrogena has to come out with a fragrance free alternative for us customers with sensitivity to fragrance. It literally makes your eyes water. Even though I got this for free I do not recommend it nor do I I think I will continue to use it.
7201,Barbara Shryack,1,25-Apr-19,,I have extremely dry skin & this helps add moisture. I m bothered by skin allergies & scents & so far  so good.
7202,Maizy,1,25-Apr-19,,It does take awhile to be absorbed. I generally use it when I cleanse my face in the morning  before applying any make-up. It works well for daily wear and I use a Neutrogena wrinkle cream at night. This works really well for me and I would certainly recommend the Neutrogna line.
7203,MXP,1,24-Apr-19,,It goes very light on the skin and does a good job of moisturizing. Really works. I m quite satisfied.
7204,Marianne Coyle,1,20-Apr-19,,Very light  a little goes a long way.
7205,Leslie Frederick,1,15-Apr-19,,I bought this while pregnant because I have been getting extra dry patches on my face. My dermatologist says this is best paired with another moisturizer over it. I use it that way and have noticed a decent improvement. The scent is clean and fresh. I enjoy the cooling gel feel it has too.
7206,Trish,1,13-Apr-19,,I used this because my skin is dry. It works but I have not used it very long.
7207,Jewls328,0,29-Mar-19,,I feel lied to. I had previously purchased this item in store and once it was used up  I decided to save a few bucks and buy this one. It is NOT the same stuff! Different color  texture  and does not feel hydrating. I feel like I need more lotion after I use this stuff and that was not the case before.
7208,Angie,1,29-Mar-19,,Feels great on your face. Not at all greasy and dries quickly. I ve been using it for a couple of weeks and my skin is softer. Plus it smells great.

7213,Amazon Customer,1,16-Mar-19,,Love this stuff! Feels and looks like gel when you put it on  but it blends into your face quickly like water. A little goes a long way. Works great.
7214,Julie,0,14-Mar-19,,On the fourth day of using this product  my skin on my face and neck broke out in an itchy rash. Even though I always paired this product with moisturizer  my skin became dry as sandpaper and I literally looked like I aged 5 to 7 years overnight..SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY!
7215,Channing holloway,1,14-Mar-19,,I have very oily skin that gets worse with the wrong moisturizer. This is perfect.
7216,Jl,0,14-Mar-19,,I liked the way it moisturized without my skin being greasy. I also like the scent  but unfortunately  I think that is what caused my face and neck to break out in a red rash. I gave up after a month and stopped using it. But  from my history I know that when I have an allergic reaction to a lotion like this  it takes weeks to clear up. This product has such great reviews  so I’m sure it will work well for others that don’t have such sensitive skin. The only thing I can think is that it is due to the fragrance ingredient.
7217,Bao,0,11-Mar-19,,Dry acne prone skin. Very light moisturizer. My skin was still dry after wards.

7224,michael wiest,0,12-Feb-19,,Disappointed with this product. I bought it because I have dry skin especially in the winter. I have been using this for almost 2 months now and have noticed no change  my skin is actually more dry now..and red which doesn’t usually happen to me. They also give you such a small amount for the price. The product smells good that’s about it. Oh well i’ll keep looking for something that works.

7229,Kelly,1,12-Jan-19,,I’ve looked for years for something that could help with my combination skin. 1/2 breaks out and 1/2 is dry and flakey. It took 3 solid weeks of morning and night use but I’ve got the softest skin I’ve ever had. This solved what prescription creams couldn’t solve. Believe the hype!
7230,McGeHee24,1,01-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,I love this product. I bought it after my daughter and a co-worker recommended it. I am 49 years old and I still have oily skin. I needed a moisturizer that was light  not oil based and would feel good on my skin even under makeup; this does. I can sometimes have very sensitive skin; this has not cause any breakouts. I will say a little goes a long way so my jar should last a while.

7235,Glory,0,06-Nov-13,248 people found this helpful,Don t buy it here!! This is not the real thing. The product is fantastic. I bought this product here and it took me 2 months to figure out that I was not getting what they talked about on the magazines. I had to re apply and use other moisturizers on top. Finally I went to Macy s and asked to try the real product  and ahhahhh! The real thing is thick and supple and feel amazing on skin. I really don t have to use anything else on top. I was so mad! I had no idea that I had bough a knock-off because the price is not reduced at all. SO I though I was just saving a trip to the mall and the tax. I contacted Amazon  and being the amazing company that they are they gave me a refund. I love Amazon! But from now on I would only buy expensive brands at the beauty counter.
7236,Randi Marie,0,16-Dec-15,52 people found this helpful,Counterfeit beauty is a big business and I have had this cream before and loved it. This is not the same thing. Not even close. Please don t waste your money. You are paying for a cheap version that (doesn t even really moisturize) in a plastic bottle.
7237,Katelyn,0,30-Dec-18,8 people found this helpful,I wish I could give it ZERO stars! Beware this is a fake knockoff!  Clinique sells the 6+ oz bottle for only $39.

Plus I live in the desert  so I constantly need to moisturize and use lotions to keep my skin looking and feeling normal. This product - after only about a week of everyday use - has saved me! My husband has been complimenting me on my soft cheeks  and even when I don t have it on  my skin just feels better!  Now this is supposed to be scent-less  and yes  there is definitely a bit of a chemical  bad smell  but it goes away after a minute. I definitely recommend!
7241,Dari Lyn,1,19-Aug-18,3 people found this helpful,This is the best (in my opinion) moisturizer in the world. After washing my face  I only need two little squirts and can rub it all over my face  even over my eyes  without worrying about burning or itching. I ve been using it for decades. On those rare occasions when I ve tried something else  I always go back to this fabulous moisturizer. Always.
7242,Alicia McMillian,1,25-Jan-18,4 people found this helpful,I ve been using this for years. I used to use it everyday  but it was clogging my pores.

7243,james .,1,03-Oct-18,One person found this helpful,This is my absolute favorite fave/neck lotion. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist nearly 25 years ago and i’ve been using it ever since. I have soft  smooth skin  with very little wrinkles. I love this product and will probably use it the rest of my life! Note  if you have acne prone skin  but the gel version of this lotion. It works just as well but it won’t cause breakouts. I used the gel through my teenage years and have switched to the lotion now that my skin isn’t as oily.
7244,Sharon Marie Thill,1,06-Jun-19,One person found this helpful,I ve been using Clinique facial moisturizer for many years now. I ve tried a couple of other brands  but  Although high-end and high priced  they did not even come close to the quality of Clinique. The scent is so light it s almost not there; it goes on smoothly and evenly and mixes well with a quality foundation creme. It s a tried and true product and I give it my full endorsement.
7245,Cynthia P. Henderson,1,20-Jun-19,,I have used Clinique since the beginning of their inception. This moisturizer is great as well as other products. But as I have aged  I wear no makeup but use this product every day. It’s light and not greasy.
7246,Amazon Customer,1,24-May-18,,This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used. Its called dramatically different and it s true to it s name. It has definitely changed my skin for the better. But it is brought to you by Clinique and their reputation proceeds.

Luckily the product wasn t damaged but it could have been.
7250,Jesse Lones,0,27-Apr-19,,I believe this was an expired product because it had a very bad smell. I used it 3 times then I decided not using it again. I went to a store to test there Clinique because based on my memories from the past this should not have any smell.... And this is exactly the case. At the store I tested  no fragrance  feels good to wear. I am very disapppinted with my purchase  I wish O had purchased it from the store at first. (For the same price!)

It is sticky and goes on your face thick and does not dissolve into your skin the way the old one would. The smell is slightly different too which made me sad. To make things worse I got a massive zit a few days later in a place on my I never normally see any action taking place plus the rest of my skin looks ready to erupt. I will say that I am 22 so it could be a factor of my age but I had been using the original for six years and it never did anything but help me and now I am afraid of this one. I look greasy after using it.

7318,David,0,15-Apr-19,,Very different color than real Clinique. Packaging slightly different. When applied  had a burning sensation around my eyes. Likely a counterfeit product.

7320,texellence,0,01-Dec-13,7 people found this helpful,This sale was supposed to be the original formula DDML  but what came is the new formula. I can go to a local store to get that  so was excited to find the original formula on here. The new formula just feels more runny and somewhat greasier than the original formula. I did have to return it. If this is the only product amazon has to sell for this item  then they need to change the picture and the description to say DDML + (plus  which is what it is now called).
7321,Linda,1,03-Mar-15,,Bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loves it  so bought one for myself  as well. Light but good coverage and works great as a moisturizer under makeup.

7333,J. A. Barum,1,20-Feb-15,3 people found this helpful,It s not perfect but it s the closest thing I ve found thus far. I have pretty dry and sensitive skin and any drugstore moisturizer I ve tried either hasn t work and/or irritated the crap out of my skin. In the summer  this stuff is perfect. However  in the winter I m still a little dry even when using this but it s nowhere near as bad as it was before finding this product. One of the things I like the most is that I can even use this around my eyes is which rare. Most moisturizers would burn my eyeballs out if it got anywhere near my eye area.

In fact  there are very little choices out there  such as in drug store chains and beauty supply stores. That s the only drawback. I either have to go to Macy s or buy it online and pay postage.

7520,jeannie Amirault,0,13-Feb-13,3 people found this helpful,After using Amazon repeatedly for many products.  I ordered the Clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotion a couple of weeks ago -- I know this product well   have used it for 20 years and have ordered it through Amazon in the past as we live quite a distance from the nearest town where it can be bought in person. . I ordered the regular sized bottle and received what looks like a trial sized 1.7 oz. bottle and it was more expensive .. Am feeling ripped off and wondering if I should order through Amazon in the future .....

7536,cristydeweese,0,12-May-12,275 people found this helpful,HORRIBLE PRODUCT DO NOT BUY HERE. Please take my advice and save yourself a big headache. I am I huge fan of the clinique moisturizer and I use it everyday. This item was purchased for me as a gift here. It clearly says on the photo  product description and product features that this would be a brand new product in the retail box WITH A PUMP. The product was shipped in a bubble wrap envelope with no box and NO PUMP. Since I ve bought this product the seller has changed 4 times to avoid bad reviews I m guessing. This product is more expensive here than it is on the actual Clinique website and you don t even get a pump. I use this lotion everyday and when I message one of the sellers asking for a pump they told me to send it in for a refund. So basically I would have to wait about 2 weeks to get a refund  reorder it somewhere else and wait about a week or two to buy the product elsewhere. They also had the nerve to tell me that in the description it said that there would be no pump which is a complete lie. I had to take a screenshot and circle all the areas where it said that the product would be new in a box and with a pump (3 times). Since I use this product everyday I am just going to have to deal with sticking my finger into the lotion to get it out instead of just pumping it out. It s a pain in the butt and I will NEVER purchase anything from Vivid Online Store  Brand Name Health and Beauty or BadRomance.
7537,K Muir,1,13-Aug-14,2 people found this helpful,I have used this product consistently for the past five years (old formula to new formula)  and though the new formula takes maybe half a minute to disappear into my skin  I highly recommend this product.  I have very dry  sensitive skin. I have found that this lotion is instantly hydrating and keeps my skin moisturized all day. Winter  however  is a bit of a challenge for this product on my skin. I live in Wisconsin  and this product doesn t always stand up to the 15 mph blasts of dry  -15F air and the dry air circulating throughout my workplace. Can I really complain about that? No. No lotion I ve ever tried has stood up to those conditions. I love this product  and I do not mind patting more lotion on my face throughout a dreadfully dry and bitterly cold Wisconin winter day. If you do not have such severely dry skin  you ll probably fare better.  For reasons that I do not understand  this lotion makes my skin look healthy. I would even say it makes my skin glow.  Pros: Lightweight  scent-free  deeply moisturizing  lasting moisturization  non-greasy  Cons: When I first started using this product 5 years ago  when I used the last of the lotion in the bottle  the lotion would leave red splotches on my face that would fade in about 10 minutes. However  perhaps because of the change in the formula  I have not had this problem in over a year.  Excellent lotion for the price. (I purchase this at department stores where I pay less than on Amazon.)
7538,tlb,0,07-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,This left my face tacky feeling! I put it on after washing before bed  it was still tacky in the morning!! It smells okay  and maybe it moisturizes sufficiently  but so does olive oil  which is much cheaper and absorbs as well or better (joke).
7539,mmcourr,0,20-Mar-15,4 people found this helpful,Well  I ve been using Clinique for 25+years. This new formula feels sticky and gross. I can t believe people like this feeling on their face. I am so disappointed! I can t use it another day! Today was the last straw. I have  and use  Clinique makeup  primer  etc and the makeup just doesn t go on nicely anymore. It just feels and looks like I have an inch of products on my face. And yes  I don t use much at all  just a fraction of a pump. Why why why change something that was perfect? My skin used to feel so smooth and wonderful with the original product. My skin soaked it in. Now  it just sits on the surface of my face. Yuck. So they had to go and change it for spf protection. Sheesh. I am returning to the store and have to find another line of skin care. Too bad.
7540,JAMES... SOUTH-WEST U.S.,1,05-Oct-11,8 people found this helpful,Okay  I ll admit it - I am a Metrosexual. If you don t know what that is  it s a guy who is not gay but tries his best to always look  feel and smell good. We stay in shape but are not muscle bound. Just tight  and yes we use designer products and buy designer clothing.  Too my point: I will break-out from face moisturizers just by looking at them. In fact  for the last 18 to 19 years  not one time was my money NOT well spent when I would go  off-product  (trying to save a little  or who remembers really) and buy a moisturizer other then the aforementioned product. I ALWAYS break-out from EVERY moisturizer  designer or store shelf items EXCEPT for  M-Lotion  and  Dramatically Different Moisturizer ; both are made by Clinique.  M-Lotion is the Men s version of Dramatically Different Moisturizer. The difference is the pricing as M-Lotion  and most men s line products  tend to cost a few bucks more. Now M-Lotion and Dramatically Diff match up so as to make the swap work without a hitch  but not all products are so mutable.  So what s so great about these two products? They seem to last forever to begin with  but here s the better stuff: The lotion or gel (gel s oil free  but I like the lotion-the gel is a newer creation) soaks into the face and neck skin completely. There is no greasy  tacky feeling afterwards. Also  THIS moisturizer makes your skin look better like right off with the first use...I guess  hence  the name. For guys who get beat-up by your razor  both are great after shave lotions too. It s what I use to calm my face. There is NO SCENT from either except for what occurs naturally by the ingredients  which is nearly nothing.  There is more  but my brain is dead right now. Hey  it s worth buying a small sized one  or getting a sample at a Clinique counter; the counter idea is not my 1st choice as I feel out of place in a store of beauty supplies. But  I have found the ladies behind the Clinique counter to be honest and really a help if you need it. Plus  they work off of commission  so you are helping them out. Hope this helps. Give it a try and let me know by commenting.
7541,saffron35,0,11-Jan-14,,I really wanted to like this lotion but it just made my acne worse. I tried the lotion & gel while they both made my face feel very moisturized.

I love clinque s lip glosses so I ll stick to thosre
7542,Desert Gypsy,1,08-Feb-12,8 people found this helpful,I ve used Clinique products for years and this Dramatically Different moisturizer is the best face moisturizer I ve found. My skin is borderline combination  slightly oily in the T-zone and small dry areas near my mouth so I need a light moisturizer. I won t bore you with the very long list of other I ve tried but suffice it to say that the list is extensive and often expensive. This lotion impresses me on many levels:  Gives soothing moisture without feeling greasy  tacky  or heavy. It sinks into the skin quickly and does not leave a residue or mask like feeling on the skin. Does not make the skin look shiny. Does not cause breakout and does not block the pores. Leaves my face feeling soft and healthy.  Relatively inexpensive; not as cheap as some drug store brands but at about twenty three dollars the quality is equal to the price. This is not a heavy formula so I do have to apply this more than once a day. I go through a bottle fairly quickly; one container will last me a little less than two months but I feel overall the cost is worth it.  I like that no matter what season it is  the results are consistently excellent.  Very pleased with this product and happy to recommend.
7543,Georgina Orwell,1,26-May-13,,This lotion feels light and absorbs quickly. My skin tends to be oily  and this product seems to work well even though it is marketed mostly for dry and very dry skin. The lotion contains preservatives (parbens) and artificial coloring to make it yellow. I would prefer it without the additives and preservatives. Also  the original list price is high. I purchased the 4.2 fl oz at Macy s on sale for $25.
7544,yazzy,1,01-Mar-18,2 people found this helpful,Great product. Used it for 32yrs now. I have worked in a cosmetic business for years beyond the fact that good skin is hereditary. However you can do things to keep the moisture in the skin that our bodies depletes as we get older but nothing is going to take your wrinkles away simply because of heredity unless you have a lot of money and you can have a facelift Clinique is probably in my opinion the best product on the market since it uses no animal products and it has no fragrances added in its ingredient. I enjoy shopping at Amazon but I found this on eBay for $21 .......same bottle same amount!!!!!!!!!!!!

7546,MizAlica,1,11-Aug-13,,If you don t live near a Macy s or Dillard s or Ulta or Sephora where you can buy this product in store - then I suppose this is a good deal. But it is $26 in the store - so it totals out to almost $31 with shipping for the price listed.  I enjoy this moisturizer - it s clean and goes on smooth.

After using this for 3 days as a freebie  my skin broke out ALL over! Red  blotchy bumps  and even around my lip area. I immediately stopped using it  and today is my second day of it being discontinued and it still stays the same. I love Clinique  but this has to be the worst moisturizer out of all of them. I never had problems with the Moisture Surge brand. Since I was low on money  I decided to try this out. BIG MISTAKE!!!!! I m so depressed about this. Hopefully my skin goes back to normal  and within 3 weeks  I will finally purchase the Moisture Surge on my face(Gel version)

It is dry and peely (probably from acne meds)  so with most moisturizers it gets very oily... This product keeps your skin hydrated and mat  not shiny. The finish of this  gel  is great. Your skin stays hydrated but does not get oily. Best lotion  definitely worth the high(er) price!

7561,Barbara Bell,1,02-Dec-09,16 people found this helpful,This lotion is the go-to lotion. Without feeling sticky or heavy  it is great for dry skin. Also  when the weather gets a bit colder  it creates a rich barrier to protect your skin from these harsh elements. (Trust me  you ll notice a significant difference while wearing this.)  The design of the bottle was greatly improved by adding a pump. It s your go-to lotion if you want a moisturizer to keep up with your active lifestyle.
7562,Sarah E Ludwig,0,26-Mar-14,,That this product has been  discounted  from $65 to $30.99 is kind of ridiculous since it sells for only $26 on Sephora. Plus  based on other reviews  it s counterfeit!

This light moisturizer is great for daytime wear  with or without makeup  and it doesn t take more than a few drops. It also can be used at night under your nighttime moisturizer  making your nighttime moisturizer go farther  which is great since it is usually more expensive. I like Clinique products and policies in general. I trust that they will not irritate my skin and appreciate the absence of perfumes in this product.
7577,Amanda,0,31-Jan-19,,The box was wide open with the safety seal flapping off- definitely opened prior to shipping. The box is all dented/scratched and looks like it was sitting for a while. Bottle was ok but top with pump was actually dirty. The bottle is only 3/4 full and the actual lotion smells very...chemically...compared to the same ones i ve used in the past. Likely will return as i m unsure if it s been used before or if the product expired.
7578,Brittany B.,1,26-Jun-16,One person found this helpful,I have used this lotion for 15 years and love it. It s not greasy  but not drying either  like some moisturizers that put extra alcohol in their lotion to help it absorb faster. I can generally put my makeup on a few minutes after applying it  and it has kept my skin looking young and supple for years. I highly recommend using it in Clinique s 3-Step System.

7628,Ashley Gemma,1,10-Aug-13,,if you haven t used this lotion  you need to right away! It has always been my favorite. It is great for all skin types. I can get oily skin but this doesn t have oil or cause breakouts and is lightly perfumed. It dries quickly and provides a great primer if you are applying foundation shortly after.
7629,Lynne Harnish,1,28-Jun-16,,I have always used this moisturizer and I love it. Getting it from Amazon just makes my life so much easier.

7634,Marlene R.,1,06-Jan-17,3 people found this helpful,The #1 Lotion recommended by my Dermatologist. Been using it for 35+ years in combination with the soaps I reviewed. Use NO OTHER LOTION on your face if you are hypoallergenic or have hypersensitive skin. All the others on the market contain ingredients that you can t even pronounce AND they contain perfumes and dyes...big BAD things that do nothing more but irritate your already irritated skin...why suffer? Stick with THIS ONLY. See if I m right.
7635,Patricia Whitney,1,07-Aug-16,One person found this helpful,Great! Been using it for years. Hope they never change it.

7640,Meredith,1,23-Feb-15,,Light and airy. Doesn t clog pores. I use a Vitamin C serum underneath it. I also like a little more around my eyes. This is very thin and sometimes need double application in dryer days.
7641,Hilda A.,1,18-Feb-18,,My favorite moisturizer from Clinique. Very creamy and not greasy at all.
7642,Consumer,1,20-May-16,,Good product  particularly on younger skin (teens through 30s) in my experience. I ve used it for years.

7646,Steven W. Parsons,1,09-Nov-16,,I was looking for lotion all the time something that works for my skin and I finely find one and this is the one for you who have face skin problems ....it is worth it to buying and works great for dry skin. Thank you
7647,Julie Klossowski,1,03-Feb-17,,I love this moisturizer!
7648,Pedro M Bermudez,1,06-Jan-15,,My wife has used this product all her adult life  excellent value  good service and fast delivery. Now we have my mother  hooked  on as well.
7649,BWrightThere,1,07-Dec-14,,This lotion is very light yet hydrating. My skin feels so wonderful after putting this on. No fragrance to speak off. Easy to use dispenser. Lasts a long time since you really only need a little (just one squirt of the dispenser) for your entire face. I use it every morning and it immediately gets rid of that dry  tight feeling of facial skin for the rest of the day. I have tried Oil of Olay products and that does come close  but I prefer Clinique because it feels even less greasy in my opinion. I used to do the whole three step product routine with Clinique but I m kind of a tomboy so I do only the minimum and this was the product I keep in my bathroom all the time. I also like their Clarifying Lotion 2  but only when I have pimples plaguing me on my back or face. A few swipes of that on a cotton ball seems to stop whatever greasy build up I may have on my skin without drying things out!
7650,Sylvia Van Der Shalie,1,07-Nov-14,,I love this moisturizer. I have been using it for years. I am 71 and my skin looks beautiful and young and I spent years in the sun at the beach. This lotion is great!

7670,CLC,0,02-Jul-15,One person found this helpful,Do NOT buy here! I ve been using the product for almost 2yrs and have loved it (previously purchased from clinique directly). When I ordered from this place it came in a nasty old box AND the color of the actually lotion was off (more bright yellow). I used it anyway  giving the benefit of doubt but 2wks in and I ve been having the worst breakout of all my life for the last week! Even down my neck where i put the lotion. I m 30yrs old and have not broken out this was since I was probably 17. Nothing else in my regimen or life has changed besides this lotion coming from this place! I am furious. I have a huge meeting on Monday and my face looks terrible. :(

7697,Dan,1,29-Feb-16,2 people found this helpful,I have been using Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion for many years. It is a light lotion  not a heavy greasy cream. It does a great job at moisturizing skin. It has no perfumes to irritate my eyes. It is the only moisturizing cream I can use for that reason. All other lotions emit fumes which irritate my eyes when applied to my face. A little goes a long way if it is applied to moist skin. I definitely recommend this product.

Even my older sister  who thinks she s Cleopatra  loves this moisturizing lotion and it is a perennial favorite on her birthday. It is so expensive that Clinique states the value in fractional amounts so you don t get sticker shock  but it s worth it. Once you ve tried the cheap stuff with alcohol and carnuba wax you ll come running back to Clinique.

7841,kikime06,1,11-May-16,One person found this helpful,I got this as part of a 3-step system from Clinique. My husband got it directly from the Clinique counter  but I wanted to review it on Amazon since that s where people go to get reviews.  My skin is VERY sensitive and dry/combination. Pale and gets red/irritated very easily. Some lotions left my skin red for an hour or so  thus I had low hopes for this. In the past I have done nothing for my skin because all the drug store brands I tried left me with a red face and would break me out more  even though I never get breakouts. Now  on to the review...  I use this after cleansing and toning with the 3-step system and it works beautifully. It DOES NOT leave my skin red as long as I don t rub it in hard. It is also NON-GREASY and does not leave my skin feeling or looking shiny. I use it day and night and my skin doesn t feel dry or overly moisturized. It just feels NORMAL. Honestly  at first I thought it wasn t doing anything because I didn t feel that full  kind of residuey  feel that some facial moisturizers can leave  but I don t have anymore dry skin flakes and my complexion has evened up. My skin also looks fuller and less droopy and dull. It also helps my makeup not settle into my pores and fine lines  though not completely.  I have been using this 1-2x a day for 2 months now and can say that I will continue to buy it in the future. I am very happy and impressed.
7842,Jill Clardy,1,06-Jul-13,,I can t even remember when I started to use this Clinique lotion - probably nearly 20 years ago. In fact  I don t even remember what I used before I fell in love with this product. I have very dry skin and need to moisturize as soon as I get out of the shower  but I don t like thick  oily products. The Dramatically Different moisturizer is light and goes on smoothly  and a few small dabs on both cheeks is all I need to cover my entire face and neck. The scent is light and pleasant and the lotion leaves no oily residue. I can start applying my makeup soon after moisturizing.  From time to time  I will get samples of other products and try them for a short while  but I always come back to Clinique.  The 4.2 fl. oz. bottle lasts me at least 4 months  and I get a few of the small samples when Clinique Bonus time rolls around and those small tubes go into my travel kit so that I don t have to bring the larger bottle. The pump makes it easy to dispense just the right amount  but I don t like the fact that it leaves so much unused lotion in the bottom of the jar; so I turn the jar upside down and remove the lid to dispense the remainder - I can usually stretch the contents for another week or two and drain every drop !  (Note: some of the other reviewers have given low ratings on the product because of the supplier  but I am rating ONLY the product  not the service offered by the vendor. There are other means of rating the vendor.)
7843,Mary Ann,0,02-Nov-14,,I have very sensitive skin and have been using the old formula for more than 30 years. Over the years  I tried other brands now and then thinking I might find something I liked better  but have never found anything that I could tolerate  afford  and liked. I even continued using it when a Clinique technician told me that there were so many things wrong with my face that she didn t know where to begin. So I was totally surprised when I bought a new bottle yesterday  put it on this morning and immediately started itching. I m glad they are touting the new formula on the Clinique website so I know what caused the itching and redness I and don t have to try to figure that out since that can be very challenging. But I m very disappointed and will be returning it tomorrow and beginning a search for something else that works.
7844,Mona S,0,23-Mar-14,,I am so so upset they changed the formula from the best seller. I was an avid buyer of the original formula. The new one has more petroleum jelly (the ingredient vaseline is made of) in it than before. It is the third or fourth ingredient I believe. Before  one of the prominent ingredients was sesame oil. Now sesame oil is like 4th or 5th on the list. It feels filmy and greasy because it is basically vaseline with a few drops of  natural  stuff added to try and fool us customers into thinking it s better...when the ingredient amounts make it way cheaper quality than before! Boycotting Clinique completely til they bring my original back. If I can recommend a product that s similar I d say try Olay Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid. You can get it at Target  Wal-Mart etc... It s 7 or 8 bucks and although it is fragranced I think it s very similar  by the way  I bought it at sephora
7845,JC Nolte,1,05-Mar-16,,I used to use this lotion religiously. It definitely does the job as far as moisturizing goes. My main qualm with it is that it s almost too much. My face gets very dry so I can t just use a little. However  using the right amount makes me face very shiny. At night this is fine  but during the day  it looks like my face is greasy unless I put on some powder or something. I found Murad to work best for me. It moisturizers while feeling very light at the same time. It is significantly more expensive than this one though.
7846,Shaken1204,0,29-Nov-18,One person found this helpful,Something isn t right with this product. The first time I tried it my face broke out horribly. I will only buy from the Clinique counter at the store. This seems to be a different product.
7847,All about comfort,1,30-Jul-18,,I am 57 yo and have been using this product for about 2 years  and it IS dramatically different! Worth the money!
7848,MeinVA,0,22-Jul-14,8 people found this helpful,I have been a loyal user of the DDML  from Clinique  for over 10 years. I liked the original formula so much  that the last time I purchased it  I purchased 2 bottles  so that I wouldn t run out. When I recently purchased it  I was made aware that the formula had been changed (did not purchase from Amazon  but from a high-end department store). I was disappointed  but hopeful that the new version would be even better (if that was possible) than the original. It is NOT. It is AWFUL. The new product leaves a sticky film wherever it is applied and never penetrates the skin. I ve applied it at night before going to bed and it is still sitting on my skin in the morning...and I only use 2 - 3 drops (less than a dime-size dollop for my face and neck). This is not just my opinion. Go to the Clinique site and look at others reviews. The overall recommendation of their customers for the improved version  DDML+  is only a low 63%! The last time I purchased the DDML from the online Clinique store  the original formula had a 5-star rating. The original formula didn t need to be  improved.  It was light  penetrated the skin quickly  and left it nourished  moisturized and healthy looking all day. This new stuff is heavy  the skin doesn t (can t?) drink it up and one is left with oily/shiny looking skin that feels like honey is on it. Awful...just awful...I cannot express just HOW awful this product is. I wonder why Clinique changed it and why they re not bringing the original back. A LARGE portion of their customers want it back. I can only think that the  improved  formula is cheaper to produce and they re charging the same amount  so they re making money. It surely is not about the product being the winner that the original was. I will not be purchasing DDML again  unless they bring the original formal back.
7849,Holly Lauber,1,02-Jan-11,4 people found this helpful,I have an issue with dry  patchy skin  especially during the winter time  and especially on my face. It doesn t matter what I wash my face with  it always feels dry and itchy. Other lotions made me break out. I decided to use this lotion on my face and it was wonderful. It didn t take a lot and it soaked right up! This lotion was a big relief. It even works fine in my oily areas. I always wait until they do one of their free gifts with purchase to purchase my Clinique products  this way I can try out their other products to see if I like them. That s how I found this lotion!
7850,Faery Faye,1,18-Mar-15,One person found this helpful,If you are on your late thirties and looking for really dramatic changes  then this is the product for you. I love how well it absorbs and how it doesn t leave my face sticky. I use it as a moisturizer and makeup base in one so that s a lot of dollars off my expenses. It really works as it has lessened my frown lines within just 2 weeks of using it day and night. I would highly recommend it. It might be pricey but it sure as hell is worth it!
7851,Pinktooth,0,02-Nov-12,,The product was just Ok. I received it as a free generous sample and used it completely to make sure I give it a fair chance. It didn t break me out. I don t have sensitive skin but Clinique products are very good for people with sensitive skin. I feel that it made some minor improvements in my skin tone but nothing dramatic. I prefer RoC and Regenerist products better.
7852,myexperience,0,01-Jun-14,4 people found this helpful,The list of ingredients of the new  plus  lotion is twice as long as the original lotion.  The plus lotion made our 27 year old daughter s face BREAK OUT! As soon as she stopped using the new  plus  lotion  her face cleared up.  She has been using the original lotion for several years. Any suggestions for a replacement lotion?
7853,Andrea,1,03-Sep-13,,This lotion works great at keeping your face moisturized and preventing breakouts. I have combination oily-to-dry skin; I often have random dry and flaky spots during the winter  but have oil and breakouts due to drinking a lot of coffee! This lotion evens out my skin and leaves it feeling baby soft and clean. Used along with the Clinique Clarifying Lotion  you will have noticeably less breakouts and redness. It also smells really nice and lasts forever because you only need to use a little drop at a time.
7854,G J Timmons,0,18-Jul-16,,I bought this product not checking the ingredients first. I have combination / oily skin. Within 2 days my skin broke out. Later found out it has oils in it. I would not recommend this moisturizer if you have oily skin.
7855,meallyse,1,20-Sep-13,,I use this product everyday and totally love the way it makes my skin feel moisturized but never oily. I usually am all about getting a better deal on amazon  but for this product it is actually cheaper (and you usually get free shipping or a free gift) if you go through the clinique.com website.
7856,KosmetixQueen,0,14-Oct-14,2 people found this helpful,I m not the only disgruntled person here  let the review speak for themselves! This is not the quality you have come to expect from clinique. You should try younique brand illuminate clean or illuminate clear. Its just a better product  100% natural  hypoallergenic and NO chemicals or fillers. And they are the ones with the original 3D fiber mascara (which is also AWESOME!) Anyway  better than clinique and is guaranteed. I get mine at lashalert.com
7857,FanGirl85,1,02-Dec-12,10 people found this helpful,This has been my go to moisturizer for years. I am always up from trying other  newer products but my faith in Dramatically Different always leads me back to what my skin loves. This moisturizer is as classic is Audrey Hepburn  yet as functional as Andy Warhol.  Suffering from sensitive skin  this moisturizer is incredibly gentle. It s light weight and doesn t clog my pores. They offer convenient travel sizes that you can take anywhere.  My only complaint would be that they use a few chemicals that are a major no-no for health conscious individuals  like Yellow-7. I don t understand why they can t just make it white. Why do they have to use the color yellow as a gimmick? Go natural and they will have a hell of a lot more marketing to use to their benefit.  Other than that  I highly recommend this moisturizer for anyone that has sensitive skin. What makes this moisturizer even better  is that it s for all skin types so anyone can use it!
7858,Amanda Customer,1,22-Jul-14,,I bought mine from a store (got a free sample) it s the best lightweight lotion I ve ever tried  and I was on proactiv before.  But it smells like cardboard? But that only lasts a minute or two
7859,PJ,1,01-Aug-14,,After trying and being very satisfied with the moisturizing gel this is no longer my favorite. Although only in the summer. In the winter would use the lotion due the cold climate where I live.

7861,Prijedor,1,18-Jul-12,3 people found this helpful,I absolutely love Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing lotion. I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily. It s also oily in the T-zone and dry everywhere else. I have found that if I use this lotion during the fall and winter it s absolutely perfect. I then switch to the Clinique Moisturizing gel for spring and summer.  The only thing that I wound improve is the bottle. The pump is poorly made and the dispensing mechanism too small. Overall  however  it s a good product.

7866,P s Mommy,1,02-Jun-09,15 people found this helpful,My mother used this every day when I was growing up and so I started using it sometime in highschool when I would have dry skin on my face or was peeling from sun exposure  etc. I don t have dry skin  but there are times when I need this lotion  mostly when it s really cold or when I ve been out in the sun  but it works well under my makeup  it doesn t cause break outs  and it doesn t burn or have an odor. So  I m definitely hooked on this stuff. Most lotions cause your face to break out  but I haven t found that to be the case with this one.
7867,Kerri Sayles,1,03-Dec-15,,I really do love this it has made such a huge difference to my skin ever since I started using this.

7877,Eric,0,06-Dec-18,66 people found this helpful,I LOVE the exact same mask I bought from Sephora  it makes my skin so soft and hydrated. I started running out so ordered from amazon  and I think the amazon version is expired or something. It made my face sting and actually made it drier. I still have some left from the original I bought at Sephora so I put each of them on different parts of my face  and got totally different results. This one itches and made my skin dry  the other made it soft and glowy  so there is definitely something wrong with the one from Amazon. If you get the make somewhere else  10/10  if you get it here  1/10. Obviously I knows here the same product but I think the one sold here is expired or was stored improperly? I have no idea.

7880,Kia V.,1,27-Nov-17,42 people found this helpful,I ?? this product. I’m on my 3rd jar and just placed my 4th order. I have combination skin and is in my early 30’s. I have never broken out with the product.  When you visit the US website  The product claims result of   skin looks and feels radiant  refreshed  and soft. Wake up to soft  glowing skin.  Let me just say that this product owns up to every word it says.  The product comes with a small spoon or spatula. I do like using the spatula to grab the product. I feel like I’m not contaminating the product with my fingers. The jar that the product comes in doesn’t seem heavy but when I add all the other products together in a bag  it’s the heaviest or one of the heaviest skin products I own.  How I use it at night: I do follow and use the 10 Step Korean Skin Care routine. So after the 1st cleanse and 2nd cleanser  toner  beauty water  serum  moisturizer  eye cream  I then apply the water sleeping mask evenly on top of my skin products.  I can see that the product absorbs into my skin even with all the other products on my skin. In the morning after washing the product off  my face looks and feels beautiful. It’s soft and looks so radiant. I have a healthy glow.  As a tip I like to add is that I love using this product as a pick me upper when I have a special event or date nights and my face needs extra loving. I put this product on 20 mintues before I need to do my make up. Rise the product off and Bam! My face looks a lot healthier then it did 20 mins ago. I did add a photo of this pick me up tip so you can see the difference. Just imagine what this product can do to your face if you did sleep in it!  I highly recommend this product.

This mask hydrated my face the entire day  evened my skin tone  and got rid of the redness and discoloration. the fragrance was slightly irritating when I first applied it  but once the product was absorbed  it felt very calming  cooling  and nice. to notice such a big difference in a day made this purchase worth every penny. Korean skin care is the best.
7883,Cori,1,30-Jul-18,11 people found this helpful,My god  a 5 star rating is not enough for this product. I have a friend who is an  influencer  or whatever  and she posted this product on her instagram. She was raving about it so much that I got curious and bit the bullet. I have started to use it every night and I can already tell my face is a lot clearer than it was before. I m OBSESSED! I would buy a million times over. It s so light  it feels and smells nice and delicate. It doesn t leave my face insanely greasy and it even comes with a little applicator  which I love. LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!
7884,Toram,1,04-Sep-16,25 people found this helpful,It s nice and thick and has a fresh scent  and doesn t leave your skin feeling oily before bed. By the time I wake up my skin feels fresh and almost plump instead of dry or dehydrated.
7885,ViVi,1,15-Nov-17,13 people found this helpful,I ve only been using this almost two weeks now on top of my nightly skincare (wash  toner  serum  eye cream) and it really seems to retain the moisture well- it s even looking like my residual acne scarring is being helped by this- could be either because of the product istelf  or the fact it s keeping my other products on well as I sleep (possibly both). Also it has a fantastic feel to it and a light  pleasantly refreshing scent
7886,John,0,23-Jan-19,10 people found this helpful,I ordered this very excited to use it based on other reviews  however upon arrival  I opened the product and as you can see in the image  stuck to the bottom of the seal(the part that touches the product) WAS A HUMAN HAIR. I m a fair bit disgusted by this.
7887,Andi B,1,20-Feb-19,5 people found this helpful,WOW this stuff works!  After about 5 years of sticking to my derm s recommended routine of wash your face and apply ceravee PM  I decided to switch it up when I got a little sample of this stuff in a Birchbox. Even after one night I could see a noticeable difference in the brightness and clarity of my skin. I prefer to apply it without any other face lotion and it still seems to do the trick  but does need to be washed off in the morning. The consistency is light and gel like and you barely need more than a nickel size dollap to cover your whole face.  The recommended use is only once or twice a week but I haven t had any issues doubling up or using three times in a row- so there is potential to use it as a daily night cream if you do not have sensitive skin. Especially for the price point  it is totally worth a try!
7888,Jackie,0,12-Oct-17,9 people found this helpful,This product did the literal opposite of What it should have done. I tried this product for 3 weeks only to notice my skin gradually getting worse dry patches. My chin looked disgusting! I know it was this product because I do the 10 step Korean skin care with snail mucin serum + essence + moisturizer. I really wanted to like this product  I read so many positive reviews about it. It makes me wonder if I got a fake product.
7889,Jessica A. Miller,1,05-Oct-17,6 people found this helpful,I love this! I was worried when I read the instructions and it mentioned the fragrance. I have sensitive/reactive skin with rosacea and need to be very careful about products with fragrance. However  this had a light fragrance and didn t cause any negative reaction. It made my skin feel plump and moist (both gross words  but accurate). I actually even used it 2 nights in a row and saw nothing but positive effects. My skin was dewy and smooth. Woo hoo!
7890,Shelby Spoon,1,06-Mar-19,2 people found this helpful,This is by far my favorite amazon skincare product I’ve purchased so far! I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and pretty much anything will turn my face red or break me out unless it’s a product my dermatologist gives me. I decided to give this a try since my normally oily skin is dry right now due to the winter and figured this would help. I’ve only used it a few days and so far my skin already looks so much clearer and more moisturized! I had a under the skin pimple that’s impossible to pop and after using this overnight mask 3 times it’s completely gone. If you have super sensitive skin definitely give this a try! Definitely plan on researching other skincare products this line offers so I can try them out.
7891,McZack,1,11-Aug-18,3 people found this helpful,I purchased this when I was just about to have my third child as I read that if you wear this overnight with very little sleep  your skin still looks good. I have to say that it does the trick. I would put this on a few times a week and it kept my skin looking decent without doing my normal skin routine opting for more sleep rather than my usual 30 minute routine. This was a simple trick that maintained my skin during a hard time.
7892,KT,0,25-Aug-18,3 people found this helpful,I tried this along with the Laneige 4-piece  Basic Step Moisture Trial Set.  First  when I put it all on  my face feels absolutely saturated and weighed down  slightly uncomfortable. I put the mask on top of all that (as instructed)  and when I wake up in the morning my skin is just dry and looks normal. There are better night masks out there  I wouldn t waste my time with this one.
7893,C. James,1,28-Dec-18,2 people found this helpful,YES!!! This product has completely saved my skin this winter. It feels amazing and cold going on  which was a relief for my dry  painful skin.

7894,Misaki,1,09-Apr-19,2 people found this helpful,Laneige is a pretty good skin care line. I was skeptical about this but I took a chance. I love this product! Not too thick or cakey  applies nice & light. Love the smell & makes my skin glow/look fresh & smooth in the morning
7895,chongo,1,16-Apr-17,4 people found this helpful,This is one of my most favorite beauty products ever! The consistency is beautiful  it dries with a softness  which makes it lovely to sleep in. My skin always feels refreshed and replenished after each application. Really a wonderful product!
7896,Miss Lucy,1,20-May-19,One person found this helpful,I ordered this on amazon as I previously purchased this product at Sephora. It’s more expensive at Sephora however  I noticed that the packaging for this one is a little different. It smells and moisturizes the same as the jar I bought at Sephora. I even did a comparison putting the Sephora one on one side of my face and the amazon one on the other. I’m giving this the benefit of the doubt but overall it does the job.
7897,AmazonCustomer,1,03-Mar-18,2 people found this helpful,Not the nicest smell  but it helped add extra moisture to my skin at a fraction of the cost of my creams from my preferred skin care brand! I just add it over top of everything after I ve completed my skin carcare routine to seal everything in and add extra moisture.
7898,G V,0,03-Oct-17,4 people found this helpful,It isn t even remotely moisturizing. The few times that I used it  I ended up reapplying my old moisturizer over it because it was just not doing anything. I don t have dry skin either  I have combination skin  but this product just did not work for me. I wish I had looked to purchase or try it elsewhere so I could return or exchange it.
7899,Annie,1,17-Oct-17,4 people found this helpful,Have been using this brand’a sleeping mask for a long time. This one is just as usual. Not greasy but needs a little while to asorb.
7900,Jeanelle M.,1,05-Jun-16,6 people found this helpful,This is my favorite of all night creams! I have dry skin but I don t like thick  creamy products. This hydrates my skin and has a watery texture (hence  the name). I love it and recommend anyone to try it out.
7901,Kelcee Schenk,1,06-Oct-17,2 people found this helpful,You guys....I’m OBSESSED with Laneige products-especially the lip sleeping masks (if you haven’t tried them please do because they very well could change your life...and your lips) this product is awesome though. I have sensitive skin and this mask has some good things for it. The smell is nice and light and not overpowering. I typically use it 3 x a week after my moisturizer and wake up with beautiful glowing skin! I truly can’t say enough good things about this product!!
7902,DNChapek,1,08-Jun-19,,I have purchased several of these as gifts  since I started using it myself. This is now my go-to brand for all of my facial products. I plan on trying all of the other Laniege products that seem appropriate for my face  as I begin to run out of the products I am using myself  and will definitely give the thumbs up/down here  when I do!
7903,Amazon Customer,0,13-Feb-19,4 people found this helpful,This product make my skin itches and dry  It look like faked product.
7904,382664891,1,09-Mar-17,5 people found this helpful,Love it. My face feels very soft the mornings after I use this product.
7905,Amazon Customer,1,29-Nov-17,2 people found this helpful,This mask is pretty good! I was looking for a night time mask and it dries down fast  and doesn t feel gross when you wake up. Really helped my skin be less gross  dry  and flaky  and I haven t had as many skin flare ups while using it.
7906,Josh,0,07-Oct-17,4 people found this helpful,GF couldn t use it  made her break out like crazy.
7907,CA,1,01-Jul-19,,I follow a kbeauty skincare regime and this is a wonderful final step! There s no scent (at least to me there isn t)  which is a bonus because I hate sleeping packs/masks that have an overwhelming scent. It feels very light going on  but I wake up with soft  moisturized skin the next morning. It is now summer where I live so my skin tends to be on the oilier side  but I plan to see how well this works this winter when my skin is drier and more dehydrated.
7908,Lucie,1,10-Jun-19,,I ve only used a few times but it worked very well. It dried quickly on my face and felt normal; not like I was using a mask. In the morning after washing my face it felt soft and fully moisturized. Without makeup  a friend commented on how my face had such good color. If this product continues to work I will certainly reorder from this seller.
7909,Mio,0,14-Jun-19,,Honestly this was a massive let down.  I got this as a sample from sephora and I loved it so much I wanted to get the full bottle. My dumb self didn t just pay the money to get it from sephora and bought it from here. I think it may be fake  the scent is off and it made my skin even drier and flakier  it s a far cry from the product I sampled from sephora.
7910,Amazon Customer,0,20-May-19,,It s an attractive color and SOUNDS like it would moisturizer  buuuuuut no. I currently just put on a thick layer of L Oreal Nightime Cell Renewal and that does great. (Great as in the morning brings clearly plumped skin  clearly diminished crows feet and nasal lines.). Hoped for something less  old-womnish.  Didn t find it in the Lanier Water Sleeping Mask. With it  the morning brought deeper lines (kinda a shock.). I wouldn t recommend this to anyone. I wouldn t give the barely used product to anyone to try. Into the trash it goes.
7911,Tharushi Liyanage,1,28-Jul-17,3 people found this helpful,The smell  the texture  and the packing everything is to die for! I love it! Can t live without it.
7912,Lovely,1,27-Apr-19,,I was very skeptical at first when I was looking to purchase a product for my sensitive acne prone skin. I bought this sleeping mask and the first night I tried it then the next day I was very happy. It has a very light scent. My skin felt hydrated  and looked brighter. I have acne  and some scars and quite some pores. I have been using some medicine and treatment that leave my skin very very dry and sometimes peeling. It was important to find a product that moisturize and hydrate my skin without making it look oily. This is my second jar of this mask I love it cause I have great result.
7913,Niki,1,07-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,I use this along with my Clarins Moisturizer before bed and it works great! I will definitely repurchase. A little goes a long way.
7914,SR,1,31-Jan-19,,This winter has been brutal for my skin and this mask has been an absolute life saver! I love using is after exfoliating (Cocokind Sea Moss exfoliater). When I wake in the morning my skin is so hydrated and feels so smooth to the touch. I plan to have this is my arsenal of beauty products full time!
7915,Alyssa,1,08-Apr-19,,I have atopic dermatitis  so my skin is very sensitive to everything. I have worn this product for three nights and it is INCREDIBLE! I normally use CeraVe cream at night because it is thick and great for my super dry  sensitive skin. This product is even better!! I haven t had a single bad reaction with it. My skin feels butter soft when I wake up. I put quite a bit on and just spend the time massaging my face to get the product in my skin. Highly recommend for people with eczema and atopic dermatitis or even people with dry skin.
7916,Amazon Customer,1,03-Sep-18,One person found this helpful,Love so much. The texture is super light & gel-like .. it absorbs in seconds. Not perfumey. When it use it (especially after skipping a night) I really notice a difference. I have sensitive skin & many products are too harsh. My skin also errs on the dry side so I really benefit from using this over night. It’s not heavy so you won’t have to wash your face in the morning if you’re running late Took me about 4 months to finish using almost every night on my entire face & neck I highly recommend !!
7917,Ajshe Sulejmani,1,04-Apr-18,,This product is really nice and calming to put at the end of the day and rest with. I already have clearer skin so I m only victim to a few pimples that may come and go  but I ve noticed the frequency of their arrivals decrease with this mask. I feel as though my skin looks brighter in the morning.
7918,Amazon Customer,1,07-Jul-17,One person found this helpful,I love the texture of this moisturizer. It s not too heavy and it really do its job. I haven t break out at all from using this. Will definitely buy again in the future.
7919,Amazon Customer,1,29-Jun-17,One person found this helpful,I think this is the first time I ve written a review or maybe I forgot  but MAN just the first night after I used this the next morning my face felt like a baby s butt. I used in combo with the Mizon Snail Repair Intensive Ampoule  so I m not sure if it s pulling all the work. The texture of the product feels light and the product does feel like it provides a lot of moisture (just as much add regular cream to me anyways). I ll definitely keep buying this. I see what the hype is about now. :)
7920,tisha,1,24-Aug-18,One person found this helpful,I leave t on over night and my face is glowing the next day. It feels very light on your skin and not sticky at all!!!
7921,Christine Villafane,1,20-Jun-19,,I ve tried many different products & I love this one. I use it at nighttime & it s very light. In the morning my skin is so soft & it doesn t feel greasy or sticky.
7922,Kelsey,1,11-Feb-15,2 people found this helpful,I ve lusted after this a while and I finally nabbed it when it dropped in price. It came packaged up nicely  and when I opened it I was pleased that the scent isn t too strong. The pack is like a gel  and a little goes a long way. I really like it  the morning after my face feels plumper and smoother. The moisturizing effect in this is perfect for my combination skin  it doesn t make my oily parts oily at all.
7923,Sweets3,1,05-Sep-16,3 people found this helpful,It keeps the moisture in and my face feels soft and plumped in the morning. Highly recommended.
7924,M,1,09-Sep-18,,You need this. Bought this for my travels this past summer and it was a game changer. Used it on the plane ride and whenever my face needed an extra boost of hydration. It s not that sticky. Give it some time to dry down before sleeping
7925,Erika O.,1,27-Nov-18,,I absolutely love this product! I apply it about 3 times a week and each time it leaves my skin noticeably brighter and softer! This is a must have in anyone s skin care routine! This product also feels like I’m  treating  myself and my skin since the smell and the texture is so lovely!
7926,Alyssa,1,30-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,IT SMELLS AMAZING IT S MOISTURIZING ITS SO GOOD AND ABSORBS EASILY NOT GREASY TACKY FEELING SO COOL TO THE SKIN  I LOVE IT SO MUCH AND WILL FOREVER BE MY FAV MASK!
7927,aliengirl,1,16-Sep-18,,Haven t seen any magic result yet. But it has nice smell and is very mild on face/eyes. And the texture is jelly watery  like it. Don t expect if you have uneven skin tone and hope to get it better overnight. It only help moisturizing my face.
7928,bernadette,1,22-Jun-17,2 people found this helpful,This is very light and not creamy. I would suggest this for people who have oily skin as its not thick or creamy.
7929,Chris,0,19-Oct-17,3 people found this helpful,I really wanted to love this but I quickly came to realize it was breaking me out  even when I used it sparingly.
7930,B. Halvorsen,1,27-Nov-15,4 people found this helpful,I never write reviews . . . EVER  but for this  I will make an exception. It is phenomenal. My skin has a history of being sensitive and very prone to breakouts. For the first time in my life  I love my skin. This product has left it clear  bright  and super soft. I highly recommend it  and I hope it works as well for everyone else who tries it.
7931,Darla,0,27-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,This is not the same product you buy in stores. I don’t know if this a knock off of it. The texture is different and If you compare this to the real one there are slight small differences on the product labeling.
7932,lynda kosnik,1,08-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,Light weight  not greasy. I put it on my face before going to bed. My skin feels great the next morning!!
7933,Hillary Leonard,1,05-Feb-19,,I absolutely love this stuff! It’s like giving your skin a drink of water. I use it almost every night  and if I want to look extra  fresh  I use it as a 15 min mask before applying makeup. It’s a life saver for after flights  and actually next time I fly I’ll probably wear it on the plane. Will definitely be purchasing it again. Oh  and this product is about $12 more expensive at Sephora ??
7934,no name,1,19-Nov-18,,I got a sample of this product and that is why I purchased the full size. I moisture surge by Clinique. This product costs less but is a bit stickier than the clinique  so I use this exclusively at night.
7935,lena,1,21-Apr-18,,It’s a good product and does what it says. I use this overnight as my last step after my at home peels or if my skin feels tight and I wake up with soft skin. It hasn’t caused any breakouts on my oily acne prone skin. It’s nice  but I do think I can find an even better overnight mask.
7936,zeeshan,1,05-Feb-19,,This is such a wonderful product. Made my skin so soft and supple in the morning. It’s a huge bottle and smells amazing. Little goes a long way. I use this over my reg night products as an extra step
7937,Ryan,1,14-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,My skin looks great the day after using this. Be sure to clean your pores in the morning since it will cause breakouts if you let it stay in.
7938,Sherman Worth,0,22-Sep-18,,My second order from this brand. The jar is bigger than I expect but It litterly do nothing. When I woke up my skin feels kinda dried. Really disappointed.
7939,Lon,1,31-May-18,,This dries up quickly upon application. The result can be seen in as little as overnight. You will wake up in the morning with soft and moisturized face. I was given as a gift and ordered from then on.
7940,Sealed With a Kiss J.,1,09-Apr-18,,Seems very moisturizing and doesn t smell bad. I use it before I go to sleep and I wake up with a softer face. When I wash my face in the morning it does feel a little slimmey to wash off.
7941,Nan80,1,09-Feb-19,,I was living under a rock ! I live this cream ! I wake up in the morning with such a healthy glow it’s crazy!
7942,Kaila Powell,1,25-Jun-19,,This reminds me of the Neutrogena Hydroboost Gel   only that you get wayyyy more product with this one as opposed to the Neutrogena. Great for oily skin  lightweight  not sticky or greasy  melts into the skin and leaves my skin looking plump and rejuvenated
7943,Jean M. Gallant,1,14-Aug-18,,My daughter uses Laneige water mask to improve her complexion. She no longer has acne  and her scars have faded. She looks beautiful  and her skin is glowing. Try this product!
7944,Amazon Customer,1,08-Jan-19,,My holy grail!!! I have really dry skin and this is the only moisturizer that kept my skin hydrated without being oily. Love it! This is my second purchased!
7945,chrisa,1,05-Oct-18,,Hydrate your skin. Been using it for years. Good. You can also add essential oil in it. Works great. I have dry skin. So I love this
7946,SassyBanjo,1,11-Jul-16,One person found this helpful,This is a nice sleeping mask but the whole concept of sleeping with something applied thickly on the face is not something I m used to. I will use it up but will not repurchase. If you like sleeping masks with a slight flowery scent  you will like this product.
7947,Cheri A. Smith,1,13-Jul-17,2 people found this helpful,My face feels great the next morning! I ve discovered Korean skincare and I m African-American!!
7948,Angela,1,25-Jul-18,,Got this as a present for my mom (which I still use here and there) and it is absolutely amazing if you have dehydrated skin! I used to put it on more often during the winter months in the evening  and when I woke up in the morning to wash it off  my face was plump and glowed! My mom loved it too. Definitely would buy again.
7949,alena summ,1,13-Jun-18,,Love it. Smells so good  feels so good. Don’t expect to get any big improvements in your skin  Just enjoy it on a night you want to pamper yourself with a epsom salt bath and a good book.
7950,rosie,1,22-Jan-15,One person found this helpful,With all the new skincare products Ive been trying this was the most expensive. But definitely worth it. I didnt feel like buyers remorse or anything because the first night i put it on it felt amazing. I woke up the next morning and still was so hydrated even after rinsing off. I love it! I cant speak for all sleeping packs but this one works.
7951,Lilylove75,1,25-Feb-18,,Laneige products are really good and the price is very reasonable as well. This water sleeping mask is really easy to use for every day mask keeping your skin soft  smooth and hydrated. I m glad Amazon carries this brand.
7952,PO,1,15-May-18,,This helped me a lot during the winter time where my skin was extremely dry. I use this as the last step of skin care routine. When I woke up in the morning  my skin felt so soft and not dry anymore. It will be my staple for dry winter time.
7953,Nobody,1,14-Apr-19,,Love this mask! Idk what some of the other reviewers are talking about  but this mask is the genuine article. No skin sensitivity whatsoever (and I have very sensitive skin.) Will purchase a million times over!
7954,Kindle Customer,0,01-Nov-17,3 people found this helpful,This product feels as though it is drying out my face rather than hydrating it

7958,Elle,1,12-Jan-19,,I have been using this product for over 2 years now. I like it a lot. I apply on skin at night and in the morning when I wash my face it still feels plump and not dry at all. I recommend this

7962,LISA ALEXANDER,0,07-Jul-17,,It took me a while to get past the strong chemical scent and the product itself is just okay. It is cooling but I don t think it makes my skin that soft or improves texture.  I personally like the water mask from natures republic more.
7963,Solo,1,01-May-19,,Very nice product. It is very hard to please me  but I am ordering this product for the second time. I feel the difference in the morning when I use this mask. And the price is nice too.
7964,Amazon Customer,1,03-Jun-19,,Love this stuff! Also use the eye sleeping mask. I’ve purchased this a few times  also the lavender one which smells amazing
7965,Amazon Customer,1,27-Nov-18,,It is a pretty good overnight mask  good price. My skin type is dry  I need to use mask to keep balancing. For this mask  all I need is to apply it on my face and then go to sleep. One little thing that I love about is it came with a little spoon.
7966,zhelobanana,1,10-Feb-16,One person found this helpful,This goes on like nothing  and does a great job at moisturizing. In addition  I feel like my skin has cleared up a lot more since I started using it  which is really really really nice.
7967,Amanda T,1,31-Jan-19,,Great night-cream. Moisturizing but not too heavy.
7968,bmagz,1,10-Aug-18,,Just perfect! Apply on your face at night and you’ll see the difference in the morning. I like it a lot!

7981,Lauren,1,05-Sep-13,,I splurged and took a risk with this sleeping pack  but it s one of the best purchases I ve ever made in skin-care. It has such a light scent and doesn t leave your skin feeling oily. As a matter of fact  it sinks into your skin very quickly and easily. (my skin normally takes a while to soak things up  but this stuff disappears like magic). It s become a relaxing part to my nightly routine :D

7986,Melissa Goldman,0,19-Mar-17,4 people found this helpful,Been using this a few times a week for about a month. Meh. It s a little sticky  but I got used to that. I just don t see any kind of radical (or even subtle) shift in my skin on the days I use it or over time. And if I use it on the same day as an exfoliating treatment  it burns. So basically  I m going to use it up (seems it will last a while at this rate--a little goes a long way) but I can t imagine I ll miss it when it s gone. If I discover I m wrong  I ll update this review.
7987,Hannah Samsel,1,16-Nov-18,,I have only used a couple of times but I can already tell a huge difference in my skin. It has been super dry from winter but today it was so soft and my makeup went on very smooth. So glad I tried this!

7989,HamburgerHelper,1,07-Sep-15,One person found this helpful,I expected this to be a lot more indulgent and creamy  but instead it s like putting a very wet gel on your face. I don t like how icky it feels going on (it takes awhile to dry) but in the morning my face is dewy and super soft.

8019,Liz,1,06-Mar-16,2 people found this helpful,I bought this a couple weeks ago and waited to post a review until I knew for sure if I loved it or not  and I can 100% say that I LOVE this product. I use this 3 to 4 times a week after I have completed the rest of my skin care routine and I love everything about it. It smells very nice when you put it on  and a little goes a long way. I apply about half of the spoon that comes with it to my cheeks  forehead  nose  chin and neck and massage it all over my face and it feels so lovely putting it on. I go to sleep and wash it off in the morning and my skin feels so refreshed and wonderful. I ve been using this for two weeks now and have barely made a dent  so this product will last a long time. You can also buy this at Target  but the Target in my area always has this out of stock and it is slightly more expensive in store. Will definitely repurchase!
8020,Jessicacaaa,0,19-Mar-18,,made my skin soft but noticed more keratosis pillars.. if you have KP.. I wouldn t recommend

8032,Kathleen Broderick,1,06-Sep-14,,It s an odd consistency  looks thick  goes on thin  and feels a tad sticky till its fully dry. My skin always feels plump and dewy in the morning.

8036,Janli Gwo,1,11-Jul-15,,I ve heard of this product working very well for many people  but for my combination/oily skin  I really see no change. If anything  it s useful for creating that dry/tight feeling for several hours before you wash it off.

If you tend to be oily in the t-zone like me  I recommend applying small amount in the t-zone and regular amount elsewhere. I put too much in the first couple days and it caused pimples.

When i wash it off in the morning my skin feels super soft!
8119,36459em,1,17-Jun-14,One person found this helpful,My friend had recently introduced me to the idea of a sleeping pack and recommended this one. I have oily skin  so I was a bit hesitant on whether or not I should buy this  if it were to make my skin even more oily by locking in even more moisture. Shipping was great (it took about 5 days in the USA)  and when I applied it to my face and neck  it felt amazing. It was a very cooling and soft gel. In the morning  I woke up and my skin was only slightly oily. After I washed my face however  I did not notice my skin getting any more oily than it usually does when I don t apply the sleeping pack. This definitely helps my skin stay soft  especially around he neck area  and there is a good amount of product to be used before it runs out (I only apply this 1 time a week maximum).
8120,Kody,1,07-Jan-18,,I live in Colorado and had heard rave reviews about this product  and I actually ended up really liking it! I put it on every night and when I wake up  my skin isn t oily  but it is moisturized.

I tend to be a little oily and use prescription strength tretinoin. That can be a bit drying too. Do I want to use heavy creams on my oily skin? Nope. This gel product when used overnight plumps up the skin and even helps counter any irritation I may have. The price is right and does what it says! I love K-beauty products and can t say enough about this. Oh yeah  and it smells really great too. I always look forward to using it.

I ve used the Liole Waterdrop Sleeping Pack  which I like  but is not as moisturizing as this one from Laneige. Has a light blue tint and subtle fresh fragrance. I have very sensitive skin - dryness  rosacea and acne. This moisturizer soothes and calms my skin (the dye and fragrance don t irritate it at all). There is a noticeable difference when I stop using this  will be ordering again!

I have oily  acne prone and sensitive skin and it didn t made me break out at all  despite its pretty strong fragrance (smells lovely too!).  When applied on my skin  it feel so cooling and soothing; my redness calms down automatically. I apply this twice a week. After cleansing  applying essence/toner  cream  I then apply this face pack and leave it overnight. I then wake up to supple  baby soft  bright  hydrated skin.  I also use this after Glycolic peels too and it really helps! After a day of doing a 50% Glycolic peels  I would apply this and it would speed up the healing a little bit. Its extremely moisturizing and thick! I love this so much  I will be buying more once I m done with this first jar <3

I started drinking more water (8 glasses/day). And now  I am changing my habits to sleep earlier. I hope to see better results later. Anyway  the product smells and feels great on the face. I would recommend this product to everyone.
8175,Amazon Customer,1,09-Feb-16,,I ve been using it for a week  I didn t have any breakouts so far  and it really does leave your skin feeling soft and renewed everytime you wake up. I m planning to try more products of Laneige.
8176,crystal,0,21-Jan-16,,useless product
8177,Lydia Harville,1,16-Dec-15,One person found this helpful,I would definitely buy this again. It s very moisturizing while feeling REALLY light. I actually was a bit worried at first - it sits really light on the skin  it s not heavy or greasy  or even very  creamy  so I wasn t feeling terribly confident in how well it would work. But it s great on my combination skin  and even though it says to use it every other day or so  I think you could likely use it nightly without a problem (which I often do!).
8178,Aj,1,24-Mar-15,,feels very nice and love to apply before bed. A little sticky before i fall asleep  though.
8179,Amazon Customer,1,21-Apr-16,,Great texture. Locks in moisture.

8181,Pearl hundley,1,05-Apr-15,2 people found this helpful,Harsh Midwest winter and living with fireplace going almost everyday made my skin extremely dry. I tried to remedy it myself with homemade honey mask and aloe vera  vitamine E oil. Everything I tried did help to some degree but I was barely keeping up. My sister in Korea recommended Laneige Sleeping Pack and to my surprise  I was able to find it on Amazon. I did not see a big difference after the first night. Last night was my third application in 5 days and it was like a miracle this morning and my skin stayed moisturized all day! I highly recommend this product!
8182,Rong Fu,1,09-Jun-15,,Love it
8183,eka,1,10-May-13,,I loved this product as soon as I opened my package and applied it on my face. It s soooo moisturizing I don t even wash it off when I go to sleep. I m allergic almost to everything but this product is just made for me. Definitely would recommend it to everyone with dry or combo skin.
8184,Amazon Customer,1,20-Jul-17,,Made my skin so soft No tight feeling. It is wonderful.

8188,Samantha,0,17-Feb-16,4 people found this helpful,This product was amazing at first application. It really felt like it was a heavy moisturizer that would revive my dry skin. Unfortunately  it caused my skin to break out. My skin did not have added moisture  it just clogged pores.

8190,Mama osa,1,03-Jun-15,,Very hydrating.
8191,James Kim,1,18-Jun-14,One person found this helpful,(review by wife) I enjoy using this product  unfortunately it doesn t have results on my skin as other reviewers have shared. i do like it as a change from my regular nighttime routine  and offers the same amount of moisture as a lotion. it can get a bit messy. Regardless  well priced product  results correlate price point  & just know it does contain a fresh floral-type scent common in South Korean beauty products
8192,Bevin,1,30-Nov-14,One person found this helpful,I was so surprised by this product! I read all the reviews and did some independent research on this product line before purchasing this product and was very skeptical that it would live up to its hype. In fact it not only lived up to the hype but surpassed it! I didnt think that a night cream that was so light weight could moisturize my skin that well  but it did. I put it on and went to sleep and woke up with baby soft skin! This is now a staple in my beauty regime!
8193,Monica Choe,1,10-Aug-15,,Very hydrating but kinda watery.
8194,L,1,29-Jan-16,,ok for me. Not that impressive.

8196,Alexis Maxwell,0,20-Sep-17,One person found this helpful,I love trying new face products  so I ve tried a ton - this is probably one of the worst. It s basically like water  but instead of hydrating  it makes your skin dryer. It reminds me of when you have chapped lips and you lick them  but licking them makes them more chapped - that s what this does to my face. Useless. I wish I could return. Big waste of money. I ll try to mix this with a face tanning serum to dilute the tanner and hopefully get SOME use out of this.
8197,Amazon Customer,1,01-Nov-16,,Wonderful product
8198,Yulinzheng,1,09-Feb-15,One person found this helpful,very good
8199,Whiney_Dancer,1,09-Jan-17,One person found this helpful,I love everything about this stuff - it smells great  is lightweight  and keeps my skin super hydrated. I have combination skin that leans towards more dry  and this balances my skin tone and makes me glow every single morning after I use it. It is perfect for keeping skin moist during a heavy winter  and lightweight enough to be used during a hot summer. I love the cooling effect of the mask as well. It is definitely worth the money!
8200,nami,1,21-Dec-15,,Use it everyday. Very light  and feel comfortable. Love it.
8201,Richard,1,19-Aug-16,,Good! Very smooth!

8205,anon32,1,07-Dec-16,2 people found this helpful,my skin has been really dried out and peeling because of the winter wind  so i decided to try this mask because of its great reviews. I am not at all disappointed. The first day I got it  I took a little and rubbed it on my face and went out  came back and felt my face and it was sooo noticeably soft  i was really surprised! Not at all sticky  absorbs really well  so it doesn t rub off on my pillows or anything when I go to bed. And it takes very little product to get my whole face  so I think it ll last awhile too
8206,Yanting Chen,0,18-Nov-14,9 people found this helpful,Has no instructions！Packaging is different from the pics! I have allergic reaction within 5 min after use it. Compared with the same product I bought before I think this is fake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8207,Su Kyung Lee,1,18-Feb-14,,This is my 4th time buying it. I am in my late 20s with very sensitive/acne prone skin. My skin feels a lot more smooth and moist when I wake up. Wrinkles are also reduced too.
8208,Rinna,1,11-Jul-13,,Keeps my face nice and moist. Awesome mask for the late nighters. Don t have to use a lot to get great results.
8209,Amazon Customer,0,11-Dec-16,5 people found this helpful,I got this pack a few days ago and have tried it twice (once in a thin layer  the next a little thicker). The packaging is pretty and doesn t feel cheap. I applied it after my regular skincare routine and the consistency is great (a light gel)  smooths over the face beautifully  and absorbs quickly. The fragrance is nice without being overbearing  and really did relax me a little before bed. HOWEVER  when I washed it off in the morning  my skin was incredibly tight and covered in dry patches. It felt like I took a run in the desert without a water bottle for three days. So....not effective at all. I gave it two stars for packaging/scent/texture but that s where the love stops. I might recommend this to someone with oily skin or normal skin that needs a little pick-me-up but it probably won t do the trick for anyone who needs intense moisture or for anyone who lives where the air hurts your face. As for me  I ll be returning this one and looking for something else.  (For reference: I have normal/sensitive skin that gets very dry in the winter)
8210,Amazon Customer,1,25-Jun-17,,Good
8211,Student for Life,1,27-Jun-16,7 people found this helpful,The packaging is nice and the scent is not overwhelming or overly offensive (although I would have preferred an unscented version). It s not as occlusive as some of the other sleeping masks that I ve tried but it does a good job during the summer when my skin isn t as dry. The texture is a mix between gel and cream. It does absorb into the skin some and does not leave a oily film on my face.
8212,RW,1,10-Aug-16,,Great mask
8213,Ming Fu,1,09-Jan-14,One person found this helpful,Being sleeping pack also makes it much more convenient than normal masques. I like it. Good value as well in fact.
8214,Eunicelq,1,02-Apr-13,,very good mask. better and smooth my skin. i m lazy and i don t need to wash away the mask and i can wear it to sleep.
8215,andrea,1,22-Aug-15,,Amazingly hydrating and doesn t aggravate my oily and acne-prone skin.
8216,(Jess),1,09-Jun-13,3 people found this helpful,If I could rate this a thousand stars I would. First off  the smell. When you open it up it s like a pleasant subtle almost lavender like smell  or you know those pillow mists you spray on your bed to help you sleep? It s kind of like that. Just a super relaxing smell. It s got a little stick inside so you can apply it to your face (Don t keep the stick inside the product or it ll get lost and you ll have to dig it out) But a little goes a long way  you barely need a dime size for your whole face. It dries pretty quickly and it makes me fall asleep faster because I feel so relaxed. By the time I wake up my  fine lines  are gone. completely gone. And while they do come back eventually  It shocked me just to not be able to see them even looking so close up. The product also helped with my acne marks and brightened them up  and made my skin look lighter and more refreshed. This product is wonderful  and I m going to order some for my mother soon. This is the beauty product i ve ever bought.
8217,junie,1,17-Jan-16,One person found this helpful,I ve repurchased this many times over and continues to use it as a sleeping hydrating mask. I use this once or twice a week when I feel like my skin needs a bit of extra boost  and it does a great job at keeping your skin hydrated over night and you waking up with fresh  glowy skin. This is one of my favorite skincare products and I would definitely recommend to everyone.
8218,LEE,0,04-May-16,,don t like the smell.
8219,Jiayi Ye,1,02-Mar-15,,It works for me. I have tried this water sleeping pack when I was in China. It helps to keep my skin in good condition.

I have very sensitive skin and prone to breakouts  so I m extremely selective with the products I use on my face. Well  this product was a gamble and I m glad I got it. I use it three times a week and after every use I wake up to hydrated skin and my fine lines are plumped and reduced. Will purchase again when I run out.
8226,miranda a.,1,11-Sep-16,2 people found this helpful,Makes my complexion brighter in the morning . Not as thick as usually sleeping packs so I always add another layer of moisture before putting this on . Works greAt
8227,Reviewer,0,13-Aug-16,One person found this helpful,I really wanted to like this  but it left a light sticky residue on my face after leaving it overnight  and the fragrance/oils in it irritated my skin a bit. Not the best for my sensitive dry combination skin; will be sticking to my layer of Mizon snail cream at night.
8228,Amazon Customer,1,12-Jun-16,,Good as always
8229,HH,1,20-Apr-12,,I tried many brands and finally decided to stick with this. I have used it for 2 years and will continue unless I find another obrand better than this mask.
8230,Jess,1,24-Apr-16,25 people found this helpful,I was originally using this $15 Holika Holika red wine therapy sleeping mask  but that was running out. I did notice that the Holika Holika mask made my skin softer and smoother in the morning  especially the first time I used it! So  I wanted to continue using sleeping masks as a part of my skincare routine. Only this time  I wanted to use a preferably  higher-end product.  I did a lot of research and this name kept on appearing on articles  reviews  and websites. And I have to say I really like this mask  too  and that I understand why people love it.  1) It smells so good! It smells watery and light  but fragrant  too. On the actual instructions you get with the product  it says to inhale the scent for 3 seconds before applying it. Supposedly  it will calm and relax your body.  Destress.  But I think it has to do with simply telling yourself that you re destressing because the product says so. Also  I find night time skincare routines to generally be relaxing and calming. You re pampering yourself  putting on your lovely creams and lotions... This product just insists you take the time to inhale and breathe in the product.  2) A little goes a long  long way. It comes with a spatula-spoon thing. I don t even fill the entire spatula-spoon with product  and by dabbing it on my forehead  cheeks  nose  and chin  I have enough to cover my entire face. No joke. In this sense  it does have a watery-like consistency because it spreads so well. I ve actually used too much by using the entire spatula.  3) It  absorbs into my skin.  It s not like drying  but like seeping into my skin. I really like it. My old Holika Holika mask would stay sticky for quite some time  before almost mattifying into a not-sticky texture. This mask is different. I can tell I put the product on my skin  because it feels moisturized  but I don t have to worry about touching my face and wiping the product off. Also  it applies very smoothly  almost like silk. I can t really feel my skin texture when I gently massage it on. I love it.  ONE CON: The bottle is beautiful  I love the color and sort of translucency the outer-most container has. However  that s not how much product you are actually getting. The amount of product you are actually getting is the inner container which you can see through the first one (LOOK AT MY PICTURE). It s a decent amount  but just thinking about how much product I would actually be getting if it filled out the outer container... makes my chest hurt.  Overall  love this product. Smells good  a little goes a very long way  and it absorbs into my skin quickly.
8231,Bea Sanchez,1,31-Mar-17,2 people found this helpful,This is the best sleeping pack I ve ever used (that says alot because I m a beauty junkie). Results seen after first night of using. I have dry to combination skin. My cheeks tend to have rough dry patches  and this product definitely helped. Came in sealed and boxed perfectly. A little bit goes a long way. Definitely repurchasing.
8232,J. Lee,0,16-Sep-16,7 people found this helpful,I have normal/combo skin and was looking to give a boost in moisture. I ve been using this twice a week for about 3 months and haven t noticed any difference. It feels gel like and smells nice  but there is no improvement. I wouldn t buy this again.
8233,Wiseone505,1,28-Aug-15,2 people found this helpful,After reading so many positive review and articles about this stuff  I decided to take the plunge (an inexpensive one at that) and try out a sleeping mask.  I didn t really know what to expect. Mask to me implies that the product would be thick  sticky and noticeable at night. One of the reasons I put off trying this for so long was that I didn t want to scare my husband every night with some weird mask on (something he definitely comments on when I use a sheet mask). That is not what this product is. It is thicker than standard moisturizer  however it blends into the skin very quickly.  There is a floral scent to this  so if fragrance puts you off- you may want to avoid it. I am not a huge fan of fragrance in my skin products  but this is not artificial smelling and is light enough to not bother me.  I don t use this everyday  it is a little too thick for my combo skin for that. However  I do use it any night I may have one too many glasses of wine or while I am traveling. When I wake up  may face seems more supple and hydrated. I will definitely keep using this.
8234,Rita Ren,1,06-Nov-13,One person found this helpful,This is my second time to buy this product  really love it  and it no needs to wash it so.

8236,Li Yandi,1,21-Feb-14,,This product is amazing..... Since moving to Southern California  I ve been breaking out more than usual and now I have these acne scars. Just after a week of using this product my acne scars are slowly going away. I have not used other BB cream  but this BB cream doesn t necessarily cover up your acne  but it does slowly fade out the acne scars as you continue to use the product  which is what I ultimately wanted. I actually mix this BB cream with a couple of drops of Josie M s Argan oil  which is an amazing product as well. Together I have this dewey complex and overall even skin tone.
8237,S.B.,1,21-Mar-14,One person found this helpful,I love this product. My skin feels very soft and smooth in the morning after I use it at night. The smell is strong at first but I like the smell and I am pretty picky. I apply it after I wash my face and put on my Mizon snail eye cream and Mizon snail recovery gel. The combo of these 3 products has reduced my acne  made my skin brighter and less wrinkly and reduced my pores. Love them!
8238,Lexine,1,04-Mar-17,One person found this helpful,I swear this thing works magic. I could have a pimple and when I put it on  I wake up and it’s almost like it wasn’t even there. Sometimes it takes two days but that’s better than I being there forever. I wake up and my skin feels hydrated and smooth as heck. Also after 2minutes of putting it on  it feels like it’s not even there. I’ve tried two other sleeping packs but after using this one  I’m not using anything else.
8239,Fawkes,1,10-Oct-16,2 people found this helpful,This works wonderfully on my skin. I apply it before bed and wake up with soft  refreshed skin. It goes on light and the instant it touches my face my skin it soothed and calm.

8241,Freya Free Spirit,1,17-Sep-16,16 people found this helpful,Okay  so let me just start by saying I have ridiculously sensitive skin...like...if I even look at a new product my skin breaks out (okay not really  but you get the point). I got a sample of this mask and read some reviews online so decided to take the leap and give it a whirl. I have become quite the fan of this product and it has never made me break out which has been remarkable. I live in Austin  Texas where it gets unbelievably hot  so in the summer I keep this product in the fridge and apply it at bedtime. It has a wonderful light and fresh fragrance and is not heavy at all. I like to put on a thicker layer when I have had a long day and I always wake up with nicely hydrated skin and never any sticky residue as you might expect with a sleeping mask. It is a light but deep hydration that makes my skin feel plump and fresh. It is definitely not a heavy product and I especially recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin! :)
8242,Natalie L.,1,11-Apr-16,One person found this helpful,Best mask EVER. Everytime I use it my skin feels so soft and refreshed the next day. It s not really a mask  but more of a moisturizer and also a little goes a long way. I m definitely using this forever.

Facial Cleanse/Wash & Lip Scrub  to remove dead skin  buildup of oil  and any remaining makeup residue 3. Toner  to rebalance and reintroduce moisture to your washed face 4. Emulsion  to add more hydration to your balanced face 5. Serum  to add special nourishment/anti-aging to your hydrated face 6. Cream  to lock in everything 7. Facial SPF  to protect (Day) or Night Pack (Night) 8. Eye cream (Day formula is typically SPF  or Hydrating Night Eye Area Pack for night)  to hydrate and/or protect the sensitive eye area 9. Lip Pack (Day formula is typically SPF  or Hydrating Night Lip Pack for night)  to keep exfoliated lips hydrated and protected thought the day or night  Optional additions include facial masks once or twice weekly and facial mists to keep a hydrated face throughout the day. There are certainly other additions to any routine  but what I ve personally listed and numbered are what I find cover the basic length of a typical  daily and nightly Korean facial routine.  As always  good luck and I wish you clear skin!
8279,Iris,1,25-Jun-16,,Like it
8280,vicki,1,18-Feb-15,,thank you  i like it very much.
8281,Ju Yeong Tetrick,1,03-Aug-14,,I used ones and I can tell my face was so much moisture. I like it so far.
8282,Riley Summeral,1,24-Sep-14,,So light and cool but really moisturizes without feeling greasy. I love this!
8283,Twinkie Boo,1,12-May-17,,Very comfortable
8284,Zoee Clayton,1,21-Apr-14,,I like it so far  it s refreshing but I need to use it longer for actual results. So I will continue to be observant.
8285,Bella1234,0,17-Jan-14,2 people found this helpful,Will dry your skin even more with this cream. I bought it to be a barrier like a cream mask to create moisture.
8286,victoria,0,17-Jun-18,,So stickey your face sticks to your pillow. Do not buy.
8287,Amazon Customer,1,19-Apr-17,,I have dry to normal skin type  and this is one of the best skincare products I ve bought for myself. It delivers what it promises  which is to boost your skin s hydration as you sleep. It has a very refreshing smell  and you don t need to put a lot on to spread all over your face. It has a gel-like consistency that feels cool and soothing whenever I put it on. When I wake up in the morning  after using this product  my skin does feel brighter and healthier...and it doesn t smear all over my pillow. I use this to replace my moisturizer twice a week during my nighttime skincare routine...or whenever my skin feels extra dry from the day s activities. I would definitely recommend.
8288,S*,1,23-Jun-15,,and the fragrance is wonderful!
8289,JUN,1,26-Aug-14,,I use it for years
8290,Je Young Lee,1,26-Sep-11,4 people found this helpful,Cool and Refreshing! Moisturizing deeply! I have combination skin but it was very good and perfect for my skin  so I presume this is good for all skin type.
8291,Kyle,1,07-Aug-13,11 people found this helpful,I ve been using this sleep pack for a couple months now and like it s pleasant feel to my skin after I shower. I wear the pack to sleep every night and typically it keeps my face hydrated and soft throughout the night. The instructions tell you to use a dime sized amount for your whole face  but I m typically pretty liberal when applying it.  I recommend placing the container in the fridge to keep it extra cool. The cool sensation on your face as you apply it is great.

8293,Crystal,0,30-Dec-12,7 people found this helpful,I ve been applying this on almost every night  and it has done nothing to my dry skin. On the plus side  it didn t irritate my sensitive skin at all. But what a let down on the moisturizing part.

8295,Emilee Self,1,23-Apr-15,35 people found this helpful,Love it! I put it in the fridge so it s extra cooling. I live in Louisiana and hate the high temps and humidity  so I need something refreshing at night.  I love the scent  and I follow the soothing instructions of sniffing it and inhaling the scent. It s so nice after a long  stressful day.
8296,Carrie B.,0,10-Aug-16,23 people found this helpful,I tried the Laneige Water Sleeping Mask from a generous sample in the Target beauty box for August  which I paid for. It says to apply once or twice a week to clean skin and wash when you awaken. The product had a strong smell  which wasn t bad  but I felt was too strong for the face. (I ve used it twice now.) the texture was really nice and by my photo  you can see it doesn t leave you goopy. It looks as if you applied a moisturizer but feels... Sticky? in some places. The skin doesn t feel noticeably younger  smoother or tighter with the mask on. I noticed no difference from using my nice PM moisturizer. I don t feel the price justified the output and wouldn t buy nor recommend.
8297,Amazon Customer,1,30-Apr-16,,Good moisturizer overnight

8301,chimper,1,27-Nov-12,,I like this bag in all  but the most my favorite part of this bag is the insert bag  I usually take this off and put it in my purse or backpack  which more convenience to me.
8302,chicbunbun,1,11-Aug-13,180 people found this helpful,I rarely write reviews (this is my 2nd time) but I think this product is worth sharing.  I ve been using SKII Cellumination for the past two years and paying over $200 per bottle. Although I really like the product  I m always looking for cheaper alternatives. After reading the reviews  I decided to give this product a try.  Since then  my skin has never looked so good  even better than my SKII days!!! The gel has a light refreshing scent and absorbs into your skin after a few minutes. When I wake up in the morning  my skin looks so radiant and flawless. No more redness and uneven looking skin. I am just so impressed and utterly shocked it only costs around $20. Needless to say  I won t be purchasing anymore SKII.
8303,suki chen,0,16-Dec-14,,Too expensive
8304,Andy Vega,1,28-Sep-13,29 people found this helpful,I ve been wanting to try this for a long time - I d heard great things and the price is pretty good. I ve never used a product and thought it was really worth the hype. They usually do what they say they do and nothing really changes about my skin.  That being said - this product is the best beauty purchase I ve ever made. Even after the first night - I noticed a DRAMATIC change in my skin. It felt smoother  it didn t break me out and it calmed my current breakouts - my skin actually looked RADIANT. I ve heard this said about other products  but I can t believe the CHANGE in my skin. My pores looked smaller too.  This is now my MUST HAVE product. It keeps my skin moisturized and it s so lightweight. Nothing about it is sticky or makes my skin oily. The smell is really nice too - FRESH! I LOVE this product! I don t usually wear a lot of makeup  but I feel even more confident in my skin now and sometimes skip the foundation. Can t praise this product enough!
8305,Cryscross,1,18-Jul-13,40 people found this helpful,I expected the Water Sleeping Pack to add tons of long-term moisture to my skin. It doesn t do that. It IS GOOD for that once a week overnight treatment where you feel like your skin is so dry or overexposed to the sun and you feel like slapping on some aloe vera. This pack works best when you are one of those days. Your skin will feel softer and hydrated for a couple of days. I also tried using it overnight consecutively for a week and I got acne real bad.  I like it  but this isn t  the miracle product  to save/restore your skin.
8306,lilahtov,1,22-Oct-12,118 people found this helpful,This mask works like some of the super expensive creams and serums I ve tried from makeup counters in department stores  but its only a little more expensive than one of the nicer drugstore brands (Olay or Roc  etc.)  My skin is baby soft in the morning and this mask is so pleasant to put on right before I go to sleep at night. You only need a dime size amount for your whole face  so the tub lasts a while.  I found this originally in duty-free on the way back from Hong Kong to the United States...I m so glad I did! This is certainly one of the best kept secrets of Asian cosmetics.
8307,Qiong Deng,0,01-May-14,2 people found this helpful,So bad.after use it even feel much drier than before. Don t buy it please And it is not worth it
8308,Rachel Rock,1,09-Aug-16,4 people found this helpful,I am so glad I found out about this product. My face does not like regular cream moisturizers because my skin will break out after using them. So after having not used a  regular  moisturizer for so long I was hesitant to try any moisturizer let alone a sleep mask type one. I m guessing it s the gel consistency  but my face is so happy! My skin finally feels more moisturized! I use this lightly as a day moisturizer or a little thicker at night as a mask and both work wonderfully. The smell to me isn t overwhelmingly strong  it does smell like roses when you re first putting it on your face but the smell dissipates in a minute or so. My mom is SUPER sensitive to rose scents and she hasn t commented on it at all.
8309,MamaGhostBooks,1,08-Jun-16,One person found this helpful,I tried this because I have skin that is very dry and also very sensitive. The first thing I noticed about it is the texture  rich without being heavy. I went through my usual skin care routine and then applied the water sleeping mask  letting it set for about 15 minutes because I didn t want it to get all over my pillow. By morning  the mask had completely absorbed  and my skin was left feeling very soft. It doesn t seem to clog pores  and the moisturizing effects last long after it is applied. Definitely a good addition to a skin care routine. Recommended for: dry skin  sensitive skin  aging skin.
8310,L. Parent,1,14-Dec-14,,I live in a rather dry climate so had been looking for a good quality product to rehydrate my skin. A friend told me about Laneige Water Sleeping Pack. I decided to try it and I just love it! My skin was drying and looked prematurely aged. After I started using this product  right away I could feel my skin felt less dry and tight. Within one day I could see a difference and after just a week  my skin consistently felt well moisturized and I was no longer experiencing drying. It gave me a more youthful appearance and my complexion was so much brighter. I love the cooling gel texture. If you re looking for a good moisturizer that can compete with products twice this price  you don t have to look any further than Laneige Water Sleeping Pack. Good skin is important for both men and women to prevent premature aging of skin and help skin keep its elasticity. Get some for yourself and the gentleman or lady in your life!
8311,Vega,1,11-Mar-12,80 people found this helpful,I don t know how to describe it  but this sleeping mask has a floral? scent that I m not fond of at all (hate fragranced products). The smell is pretty strong at first  but then fades away after a few seconds and doesn t become bothersome at all. I use the sleeping pack at the end of my beauty regime to seal in all the goodies I ve slathered on my face (toner  serum  moisturizer  eye cream). Although I initially found the smell to be distracting  as someone with very dry skin  its hydrating properties definitely made it a part of my routine. It glides on like a gel  giving you a very dewy look  but not the kind you want to go out in public in (who goes out in public with a face mask anyway?). The gel feels cool to the touch and slowly absorbs into the skin within an hour while giving you that refreshing feeling. Once the mask is absorbed  I have no problems tossing and turning in bed at night. And when I wake up and wash my face in the morning  I can feel the mask dissolve with a splash of water  which signals that it really locked in all the moisture. Plus my skin feels great.

8313,Sabrina,0,30-Nov-18,One person found this helpful,After seeing so many reviews of this being a fake  I ordered from Sephora for the same price. Can t wait to get it. It s just too pricey to take a chance on authenticity.
8314,Eugenia,1,15-May-15,2 people found this helpful,I tried this product because it is marketed as  water sleeping mask  and it contains trademarked  Sleepscent  that is good for all skin types. This product is actually made in Korea. It is a gel mask that contains essential oils of orange flower  rose and sandalwood. These three oils are what makes  sleepscent  and their gentle scent helps getting to sleep. However  for anyone familiar with aromatherapy it is worth mentioning that sandalwood is not always the best choice for the essential oil for anyone who is suffering from depression. Product contains apricot extract - which I love because it is deeply hydrating and it also has chesnut extract that helps skin retexturizing.  So the water part of the label comes from the fact that this is a gel mask and not heavy; ingredients are very hydrating. But I could not understand why this is called mask. My routine typically includes  cleansing skin and applying toner. At night I apply serum that also has high concentration of vitamin C (antioxidant). The last step is to apply this gel mask. Upon applying it on the skin it gives nice cooling effect to the skin: sensitive skin  will love relief  and oily/combination skin will like the fact that mask is not heavy and cooling effect tightens the pores. Additionally  mask is absorbed very quickly and does not leave any residue. The only difference that makes this mask and not a night cream is the fact that it is recommended for use 1-2 times a week. But in my opinion this is a nice hydrating gel that can be applied overnight  not a mask.  But the results are good and product is not too expensive. Other than preservatives (which are chemicals and part of most skin care products)  this product for the most part contains healthy ingredients.
8315,yvonne michelle,1,13-Aug-15,7 people found this helpful,Love this product!! You do your regular skin routine and then apply mask on a clean/no makeup face! You apply with the plastic stick for better results. It s wet when you put it on and drys nice and smooth and not sticky. I love Laneige
8316,M. Smith,1,14-Dec-14,One person found this helpful,I m 39 and not that into all the latest skin science and stuff  but I saw this and bought it on a whim. It s kind of a  trendy  product  but it actually works. I have dry  fair skin that breaks out and is sensitive. So I expected this to give me a breakout like other things have. But it didn t give me a breakout  and the first morning after I used it I got comments on how my skin looked. It felt amazing  too. It feels like a hug on your dry facial skin and the effect does have a lasting visual effect. Glad that whim worked out for me. I d be willing to pay more for it than this. Good stuff.
8317,daydreamer27,1,07-Dec-14,One person found this helpful,I just received this in the mail yesterday from the Target Beauty Box and was excited to try it out. I ve never used a sleep mask before and this one worked wonderfully. It was not messy at all. I washed  toned and moisturized my face as usual before bed  then applied this mask. It made my face a bit shiny  but otherwise I didn t appear to be wearing a mask. Once I woke up this morning I rinsed the mask off and applied moisturizer. I immediately noticed a difference. I have a bit of a line on my forehead  but not major wrinkles since I m only 29  but that line was almost invisible! I had to squint to try and find it. Once I run out of the sample jar  I will be buying more.
8318,Victoria,1,12-Sep-15,One person found this helpful,This mask is so light  fresh and clean. It s not heavy and has a wonderful fresh smell. It does not have any harmful ingredients and is made using so many good ingredients for your skin! I absolutely love it. After my nightly hot baths  I coat my face and neck in this cream and I wake up looking so refreshed and youthful. My skin feels remarkable and moisturized. It is just as good as high-end products. I used to use Lanc?me Genifique and Clarins Night Cr?me. This is just as wonderful and has no parabens or dyes! This mask is definitely replacing all of those high-end products and has become a staple in my nightly beauty rountine! LOVE IT!
8319,Stacy P.,1,04-Apr-16,,I m really enjoying this sleeping mask! Apply after you moisturize and leave on for the night  just rinse in the shower the next day and your skin will be soft! It didn t cause break outs and a little goes a long way. I have several smaller containers and I m still not finished with the first one!
8320,courtney gilmore,1,10-Apr-18,,I have acne prone skin  i used this for the first time   and my skin feels so soft !

I love this stuff !!!!

8322,Jay,1,14-Dec-14,,Absolutely fantastic. This is used after you wash your face for the night and go to bed. You wake up feeling refreshed and your skin feels rejuvenated overnight. Since its such a small jar I would like to say that you probably don t need as much on your face as many of you are putting on. Just a dab on each side of your face will suffice and get a little more time out of each jar this way.
8323,Nanny,0,16-Oct-14,One person found this helpful,It felt nice going on but then got a little sticky after drying. When I woke up the next day and washed my face I ended up breaking out all over my face  was not happy. My face didn t seem to be any softer either. Very disappointed  especially after reading such great reviews.
8324,michelle,1,27-Feb-18,,Someone gave it to me as a gift . I love it and use 2x a day . I don t like masks but this one is easy . Perfect .
8325,Katrina,0,24-Feb-16,6 people found this helpful,I don t know what the deal is. I realize this product has amazing reviews everywhere but I ve been using this for a few weeks and I actually have lost moisture in my skin overnight. The product goes on extremely light and the morning after my skin looks dehydrated and sad as if I forgot to use a moisturizer. Really disappointed with this one.
8326,Emily Drennan,1,24-Oct-14,,Very rich and perfect for winter. I broke out a little bit the first few times using it  but after a good exfoliating I had no problem. It can leave a bit a filmy feeling if you put too much on so make sure to do the massage described in the instructions in order to makes sure it s all absorbed!

8329,Jaycee Bond,1,19-Oct-15,,Such a great product! I got a sample in the mail  used it once and my skin felt amazing! I have very very dry skin on my nose and cheeks but oily skin everywhere else. All other products I ve used would do nothing for the dry skin and would just peel off in the morning on the oily parts of my skin. I used this for one night and my whole face felt nice and evenly moisturized  it was great. Ive use Vichy  La Roche Posay  Lancome and other products and I have found nothing that works as good as this one! It has a really amazing smell too. I will definitely be buying the full size when my sample runs out!

8333,Sarah-Anne,0,19-Jan-19,5 people found this helpful,I received a sample of this cream from Sephora. It was INCREDIBLE! Unfortunately  I tried to take the less expensive  more convientent route through Amazon. This has to be some knock off brand. Not the same results  slightly different texture. I did try it a few times (trying not to be quick to judge). Waste of money. Don’t make the same mistake. Buy from Sephora or direct from Laneige.
8334,Debby Bachman,1,10-Nov-18,3 people found this helpful,Can I just say...WOW! I still need to try this product by itself but for my first time trying it I combined it with two other products. I used LUSH brand toner called Eau Roma Water and their facial moisturizer called Skin Drink. For those of you unfamiliar with LUSH it s a company started in the U.K. and they make hand made soaps  lotions  make-up  etc. Basically it s the anti Bath and Body Works (thank God) . LUSH uses all vegetarian and vegan ingredients  and it s oh so good! Their products are top notch and even though it s kind of pricey it s totally worth it. Anyways  I used my LUSH toner and moisturizer followed by Laneige s Water Sleep Mask and I was in heaven. With the two LUSH products alone my skin feels amazing but combined with the Laneige water mask my face has never felt so soft! I keep touching my face because it feels so good  lol! The Laneige mask is not greasy at all and just melts into the skin. I also have the Laneige lip mask and it s pretty good but the face mask is better. If Laneige created a lip mask similar in ingredients and texture of the face mask I think I would be in heaven. Try this mask  you won t regret it!
8335,Amazon Customer,1,13-Aug-17,5 people found this helpful,I absolutely love this so much!!! My face is oily but also dehydrated but whenever I put it on at night and wake up in the morning my face is so plump and soft! It decreased the oil in my pores and gave moisture to them! I love this product and will definitely buy again!!!
8336,Stephanie,1,22-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,My MIL introduced me to this when Target was carrying it and I was gutted when Target stopped carrying Laneige  Amazon to the rescue! This has been the best  non-greasy  moisturizing night cream. It has a gel consistency and my skin is better for using this. Admittedly  I m in my 20s so I can t say it reversed wrinkles or anything too crazy but it definitely moisturizes and it doesn t clog my pores or break me out which is perfect now that I m in the awkward space between acne and wrinkles.
8337,Becky,1,06-Dec-18,,I love this mask. Simple as that. It s hydrating and has a very light fragrance. I use this once a week (will be increasing to twice a week when it starts getting colder) and in the morning my skin is so incredibly soft. I have oily/combination sensitive skin  so anytime I find a product that doesn t cause any dryness  additional oil  or burning/irritation  I get excited. This mask is so rich but so light. I used it after I had a light peel and it aided in preventing any dryness. Highly recommend!
8338,Fingerpuppet123,1,25-May-17,2 people found this helpful,Smells lovely  isn t heavy at all but does an amazing job of moisturizing my skin overnight.

After using these two I ve had less breakouts and my skin feels much more hydrated. I definitely recommend this product!

This used to break me out  but after applying a facial oil first  it doesn t seem to anymore. I use it 3x a week at night and it really helps to keep skin moisturized  especially in winter. I also like how cooling it feels.

It does keep my skin smooth.

I havent had any negative reactions or allergic reactions to the product.
8346,Alicia,1,19-Nov-18,,I use this in the winter when my skin is dry. My skin can become quite dry from the use of Differin gel & benzoyl peroxide. I put this on at night and in the morning my skin is well moisturized and plump. It is not sticky or heavy & I cannot feel it once it has absorbed into my skin.
8347,Yana,0,22-Feb-19,,I love Korean skin care in general. Unfortunately this particular water mask did not work for me. It actually did nothing. I had to put another product on top of it to feel like my skin was no longer thirsty. I don t have very dry skin. Don t waste you money on it. Not the best product.
8348,K. D. Whittle,1,11-Apr-18,,What I love best about this mask is the fragrance. It s soothing without being over powering and helps me unwind into sleep mode. I recommend this product as part of a Korean Skincare method  or to anyone who needs additional nighttime moisturization.
8349,tanman,1,31-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,I received a sample of this  and I liked it so much that I decided to purchase more. It is not very greasy and I use it daily as a regular moisturizer instead of just at night. This makes my skin feel soooo soft. :)
8350,DevilGalz,1,09-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,I love this product as it is does not have the oily feeling like the lip mask. It feels like the night mask is full of moisture. Although it feels light  the moisture last throughout the night. The face feels plumbed with moisture in the morning even during Santa Ana period when humidity is 2%. I have used this product for a couple of months.
8351,escentialplus,1,04-Apr-16,2 people found this helpful,I m not too sure if this is the real product considering that when I received an actual one from target as a gift ! The diff between this one and the target one was that the words on the bottle was sleeping_mask and the target did not have the underscore . Besides that  the scent smells similar   texture fees similar   it didn t irritate my skin so I would trust this .

8354,sylwiabab,1,13-Oct-17,,I really like it. I m not giving it a 5 start review only because I don t think I have used it long enough to see a real difference. What I can say about it so far is that it s pleasantly cooling  it absorbs quickly and it s super easy to apply. It s definitely worth the price.
8355,Kevin J Bray,1,06-May-18,,This feels great on my skin  and makes my skin look / feel great. Light  pleasant scent and doesn t make your skin feel sticky or greasy. I am 44 and have dry skin that tends to be irritated or break out. 100% positive experience with this product. Highly recommended.
8356,Vivian T,1,25-Apr-19,,This is very nice  but I prefer to use it early in the morning. If you put it on before you go to bed  won t it just end up smeared on the pillow? Use it early in the morning and it hydrates your skin. Feels lovely.
8357,Legit,1,12-Oct-17,One person found this helpful,I really like this. Makes my skin feel very soft and supple. the real test will be if it keeps my skin hydrated this winter. I will update according
8358,Amanda,1,17-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,I ve had this for over 3 months and I m still not out of it yet. I use it every night as I have suoer dry skin. It s lovely! Very light  moisturizing  and absorbs quickly.
8359,Carmen C.,1,08-Feb-17,One person found this helpful,My skin is combination for sure. Oily T zone with dry cheeks. This stuff is like a tall  cool drink of water for my skin! You get a lot  regardless of the price. The texture is gel-cream and it absorbs slowly overnight. The one drawback for me is the fragrance. I am one who does not like any fragrance in my cosmetics and skin care  so for me it s a hit on the star points.
8360,Emma E.,1,07-Apr-18,,I have acne-prone skin  and I have a hard time finding really moisturizing products that won’t break me out. My skin type has become more dry recently  so I wanted something moisturizing but not too heavy. I stumbled upon this since I love the Laneige lip mask  and I’m so glad I got it! It’s a water-gel  but it is extremely moisturizing. I’ve used this pretty much every night since I got it  and my skin is looking so good! I highly recommend this.
8361,Victoria,1,17-Apr-18,,I absolutely love this product. My skin is so amazing the day after I use it  I don t even wear make-up. I ve spent much more for much less quality products with zero results. This is a staple for me now and I use it about once a week.
8362,Maria L. Hancock,1,08-Apr-16,5 people found this helpful,I wasnt expecting too much out of this but I LOVE it. My skin has really started to become very dry and I often need to apply moisture of some type at least 2-3 times a day especially in winter or my cheeks especially start to sting. This product at least restores my skin by morning. It is moisturized  soft  good texture and I feel like it has improved my skin overall. It has a wonderful smell that helps bring on sleepiness. It is ligh weight and comes with a little scoop so you can keep from putting your fingers into the jar. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a night cream but especially to women over 40 experiencing dryness. I will be replenishing this once I use it all which may be awhile as you dont have to use a lot on any application.
8363,LaChica,0,30-May-19,,I don’t understand why folks swear by this product. It did nothing for my skin. Not a thing. I had to add a few oils just to jazz it up because I didn’t want to waste it.
8364,Frank Chu Jr.,1,09-Aug-18,,I have super acne prone skin and it was really difficult to find a moisturizer that would keep my skin hydrated all day and not break me out or make me super oily. Tatcha water cream did that for me but it was waaaay too expensive to keep buying so i needed a substitute. This has been the perfect substitute for that. It is amazing!! Im on my 4th one at the moment. Highly recommended!!!
8365,Victoria,1,29-May-18,,I have normal to dry skin. This product feels and smells amazing going on  but by the next morning my face can feel tight and dry. I ended up using a combonation of night creams (including this one) to get the perfect feeling. I definitely recommend this product! Just don’t use this alone if you have normal to dry skin.
8366,UB,1,30-Oct-18,,Smells really soothing and calming. Good texture and really stays on overnight in order to hydrate. A bit  sticky /doesn t absorb entirely so you have to sleep with your hair out of your face  otherwise  it will be a mess.
8367,happyfeet,1,06-Mar-19,,Oh my goodness! Unbelievably luxurious serum/gel night routine! So thick I put too much forgertungvut came with a tiny spoon to measure out..looks like it will last a bit!
8368,Tara S. Mccraw,1,18-Feb-18,One person found this helpful,Love everything Laneige - No need Neiman Marcus prices with the results I?ve gotten from Laneige!! Thank you - this and the Day moisturizer are both amazing.
8369,J. Jupiter,1,23-Feb-19,,I love the rose petal smell and not much is needed. My skin was horribly dry from the radiator heat and it was peeling. I knew I needed lots of moisture and Laneige got excellent reviews on several web sites. Very happy with the product and the price was right compared to other ultra-expensive stuff out there.
8370,nymphet,1,19-Sep-17,One person found this helpful,OMG! Has unicorn tears in it!!!!!!!!!!!! Just makes everything look better including my frown lines which nothing helps anymore including botox and fillers  but this! Will buy it regularly.
8371,Isabella,1,10-Jun-17,5 people found this helpful,I ve heard awesome things about Laneige and this was my first purchase from their brand. I loved the packaging  but ultimately I was unimpressed. I have dry skin and used this overnight. However  I didn t notice that my skin was more plump or hydrated than usual. In fact  my skin was a bit more dry than it usually is if I only use my night cream (the Embryolisse Concentrated Lait Cream). However  I m happy that it didn t break out or irritate my sensitive skin. I also really liked the formula of this compared to other sleeping masks I ve tried. It isn t super heavy or thick and feels great when you put it on. I d try this if your skin isn t dry like mine.
8372,IrisDaughter,1,28-Sep-17,One person found this helpful,Love this nighttime moisturizing product. My 70-year-old face absorbs this quickly and looks refreshed and great in the morning. The texture and scent are both nice.
8373,Beckie M,1,24-Sep-18,,I read tons of great reviews all over the internet. Great purchase. My face looks and feels amazing and plump after adding this to my routine. Will probably buy again but this will last me quite a while!
8374,Anon,1,05-Oct-16,2 people found this helpful,Not HG  but one of the best moisturizing products I ve come across  so 5 stars. I put it on top of my Hada Labo lotions  my emulsifier  and mix this with a nice facial oil to get the best results
8375,Jen,1,03-May-18,,I have rosacea and this mask helps keep the redness down. It is also great with preventing dryness  mornings after my skin is soft and hydrated. Will definitely buy again  it think this may be a holy grail for me
8376,J. Moses,0,27-Jul-17,One person found this helpful,I used it at night  and in the morning  my face appeared to have dry patches. Not what I was expecting at all. I use rosehip oil with excellent results.
8377,Q-New,1,01-Dec-17,6 people found this helpful,I love the feel and smell of this product and I really like how it feels going on  but I have to admit I ve seen no improvement or difference in the texture of my skin
8378,Chelsea,1,11-Oct-18,,I absolutely love this sleeping mask. It absorbs into your skin  but you can also still feel a layer covering your skin. My face is so soft in the morning. The smell is wonderful as well.
8379,Catwoman,1,10-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,I love the way this makes my skin feel.
8380,Amazon Customer,0,17-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,I used more than once  but I do not see any different before and after.  Sorry just give you two stars.
8381,Marie,1,31-Mar-18,,It saved my life. Super smooth  soothing and hydrating. Put it on right before bed after doing my full skin routine. Just FYI I have two different moisturizers before I use this one tho as well so it could be a combination.
8382,Lanadelnae,1,13-Mar-18,,I noticed a huge difference after using this. It definitely works magic on dry skin like mine! When I d wash my face in the morning  it looked way more moisturized and refreshed than before when I used a regular moisturizer!
8383,Jindi Liu,1,15-Nov-15,2 people found this helpful,This is such a wonderful product!!! I have very oily skin and I have to bring blotting paper with me everywhere. After using this for the first time  my face didn t get any oily until after my evening running around 7:00!!! That is sooooo cool! Definitely recommending this!
8384,Cyndi Lundeberg,1,09-Nov-18,,I love this product. Every night I wash my face and put this on. You wake up in the morning and your skin can feel the difference. It is perfect for me during winter.
8385,T Riley,1,28-May-18,,It’s very nice. My skin drinks it up and it doesn’t irritate my skin. Some of the most expensive overnight creams have broke me out. Surprised that this has not and makes my skin feel wonderful in the morning.
8386,Paulina N.,1,03-Jun-16,2 people found this helpful,I love  love  LOVE this sleeping mask. It doesn t make your pores feel boggled down  but it s extremely hydrating in the meantime. The scent is fantastic and light. I love this product and will repurchase !
8387,Yi Yin,1,22-Sep-16,3 people found this helpful,It is very useful in plces where are moisture! But in dry place  little useful for keeping hydrates
8388,Samantha,1,24-Aug-17,One person found this helpful,Seriously. I use it every night and I wake up to the softest skin EVER!!! This stuff is great quality!!! Try their lip mask too!
8389,S. Kim,1,04-Mar-15,One person found this helpful,Very light moisturizer. It comes with funny directions telling the user to inhale the scent etc... but I just use it as a daily summertime hydrator. I have used it for a few months now and am pleased with the product. The scent is pleasant  and it does not leave my skin sticky. It is a very light feeling moisturizer. Feels like a gel.
8390,Diane,1,28-Oct-16,9 people found this helpful,I LOVE this mask. it smells divine and relaxing  soaks into the skin quickly and leaves my skin looking plump and translucent in the morning. causes absolutely no blocked pores/trouble. it just makes me look better.
8391,sarah,1,17-May-13,One person found this helpful,Instead of wasting money buying a lot of sleeping masks and facial masks  you should buy laneige s sleeping pack. It is raved as one of laneige s best products for a reason. A dime size amount can cover your entire face  and it feels so amazing. I used this during finals week (when my skin was feeling dehydrated and stressed) and it did wonders. This sleeping pack left my skin smooth and bouncy the next morning. It also helped with any acne or hyper pigmentation I had the night before. I also heard it is great to use on long airplanes rides...looking forward to using it then:))
8392,Roan,1,01-May-18,,Everytime I wake up after the night I applied this  my skin really feels hydrated. I don’t know but for somw reason  my cheeks become rosy in the morning when I use this. I love it!
8393,Amazon Customer,1,18-Oct-18,,I used it for the first time last night and washed it off this morning. My skin feels super soft! I love it! Will be purchasing again!

8395,Andrea Lynne Cory,0,01-Nov-18,,I saw no visible change- and it didn’t even seem to make my skin feel more moisturized.
8396,D62,1,31-Jul-18,,I use this mask most when flying and dermarolling. In both cases  it provides a sufficient amount of moisture to leave my skin feeling silky smooth when I rinse it off.
8397,Life in AZ,1,16-Mar-14,2 people found this helpful,My daughter purchased the Laneige water sleeping pack to use after using the Water-Resistant Professional Skin Care Face and Body Brush. The water sleeping pack glides on smoothly and (after using the body brush) makes your skin feel like silk! I love this stuff! Ended up buying a few more for back-up!
8398,Valeria Mares,1,16-Dec-18,,La wife is a great player in k-beauty. I apply this mask twice before going to bed. My skin is very dry and needs an extra boost. In the morning your sling will be nourished and shining.
8399,Cassandra Lynn,0,12-Mar-18,,Did not work on my skin type.. I broke out in pimples each time I used it (4) wanted to make sure it was product and not just me.. i normally do not have acne.
8400,Linna F,1,07-Nov-18,,On my 3rd jar. Really works well to moisturize my skin overnight. Usually wake up with soft skin instead of oily skin
8401,Torrie Rebel,1,09-Feb-19,,I’ve probably bought this 4 times now. It’s a very good facial moisturizer. My skin is very soft. ??
8402,Hannah Davis,1,22-Feb-16,,Smells DIVINE. Goes on smoothly and is kind of sticky for a second but then absorbs right in. I have very dry skin with flaky patches  but this seems to be restoring some moisture back into my skin. The best part is really the scent. I think it helped me sleep SO much better and I fell asleep more quickly.
8403,Olivia,1,09-Feb-18,,Very hydrating! My skin feels rejuvenated in the morning. The scent is not strong and very calming. Would repurchase in a heartbeat.
8404,Nim.C.Sherpa,1,29-Dec-15,,It s just been two days since I have been using it ... I must say this product hydrated my skin well ... Unlike other high end product when I use at night and wash my face in the morning I use to be so dry but this hasn t ... My skin is smooth but about the brightening part have to wait .....
8405,Amanda,1,28-Dec-16,3 people found this helpful,I m in my mid 20 s and recently into anti-aging & preventative skin care. This is my first  night mask  & I really love it. I put this on after washing my face at night & post toner. I love the cool silicone feel of this moisturizer - it s more of a gel but it spreads really nice. You don t need a lot of product at all to cover your face/neck. I have combo skin that gets dry in the winter & this really allows me to wake up with replenished/moisturized skin. I like the faint smell of this & it doesn t stain my pillows either. In the morning the mask is soaked up & I just splash my face with some water. I swear it is making my face/skin plumper in a good way - I have nothing but great things to say about the results of this mask - and it s really perfect if it s cold/winter where you live & you re looking for some addtl skin moisture.
8406,Afton,1,04-Sep-18,,I decided to buy this because of the amount of high reviews. This product did not disappoint!!!
8407,Lisa Coefield,0,06-Jun-19,,My product was missing from the package.
8408,Amazon Customer,0,10-Mar-19,,This did nothing for my skin! It actually made my skin feel dry and I didn’t notice anything remarkable about my skin in the morning. I have dry skin  maybe this mask is for people with a normal skin type??? Maybe it’s a fake. I won’t buy again.
8409,Abbie,1,09-May-17,One person found this helpful,Love this stuff. I think it makes a difference. My face feels soft and young feeling. I will definitely buy this again.

8415,Mario and Rachel,1,17-Apr-17,,LOVE THIS....it does seem a bit sticky when it dries so i try to keep from sleeping on my side at night with face on the pillow...In the morning my face feels fantastic! :)
8416,carmen,0,21-Oct-15,One person found this helpful,I like how it feels after I ve put it on  but it breaks me out and I ve only used it twice. I have really sensitive skin  so maybe that s what went wrong. But I m still disapointed it didn t work for me  especially since it has so many good reviews
8417,Helen,1,21-Apr-18,,I love this product. I use it twice a week after using Tony Moly peeling gel  serum  moisturizer  and eye serum. It gives me supple and radiant skin the next day. I love this product so much!!!
8418,Student for life,1,21-Jul-17,,Smooth feeling light faint smell. Not heavy but if you wet face in morning sometimes it smears power foundation. I keep it at bedside so when I m exausted and forget to put cream on after the shower it s always there
8419,Little star,0,05-Mar-18,,It is ok   but not see any different after I use it couple times. I don’t think I will purchase it again.
8420,minion046,0,09-Mar-15,One person found this helpful,Honesly  it did not do much for hydrating my skin. If you re looking for a good moisturizing sleeping pack  I would recommend the honey sleeping pack by holika holika. It does a better job of moisturizing but it s just more sticky and some people might not like the stickiness.
8421,Gabby,1,25-Apr-17,,Love this product! I ve been using this for two weeks  it feels super good after you using it. However  i don t if it is this product or another one I started trying  kind of break me out. I am trying to figure it out recently  but as moisturizer  totally recommended it.

8426,Amazon Customer,1,17-Dec-17,,My face gets red upon application  but I woke up with less red skin than ever. It definitely whitens red skin. It costs way too much for how little product it gives though.
8427,JDANNI,1,31-Dec-17,,One of the best products I ve bought! If you are looking to hydrate you skin and have a dewy glow then I highly recommend this product. No need for a long review.... this product speaks for itself!!!!
8428,N,1,18-Apr-15,2 people found this helpful,Love  love  love it!! I am 50 with a very oily skin  and it is extremely difficult to find a good product that moisturizes without blocking pores. I found out about Laneige from someone s review on Amazon and decided to try it. I have been using Laneige since end of February and is extremely happy with results: supple  fresh looking and glowing skin. I want to make it clear: using Laneige line of products is NOT all I do to have good skin at the age of 50: multivitamins in combination with good diet (plenty of high quality foods: lean red meat  butter  olive oil  egg yolk  fresh vegetables  freshly squeezed carrot/celery/apple and grapefruit/orange juice  etc)  avoidance of sun and good sun protection  smoke-free environment  regular 8-9 hours of sleep  regular microabrasion with IPL rejuvination  etc. This cream and most of other products of Laneige line are excellent but don t think you start using it and a miracle happens...No such thing.Good skin care requires a lot of effort  time and to be fully honest  money:( it is definitely not cheap at all.

8450,jesssree,1,22-Jul-13,3 people found this helpful,I have been using this product for 2 weeks now. I use it at night  after my acne gel and a moisturizer. When I first started using it  my face was very dry due to the strong acne cream. I tried many moisturizers before  such as the Clinique one and the Aveeno night cream. This sleeping pack worked the best. I wouldn t say it is a miracle cure for dry skin. It doesn t work overnight. It took about 3-4 days until my skin starts to look hydrated again--which is a reasonable duration  I suppose.  The sleeping pack has a gel-like consistency. Very easy to apply. The package came with a little spoon  which I don t use. I guess it is more sanitary to use the spoon to scoop the gel out of the jar  but I m too lazy for that. 5 minutes after application  I was surprised to see that the sleeping pack had absorbed completely into my skin  leaving a smooth face behind. It doesn t even look or feel like I applied anything onto my face! It does not feel heavy like a mask. It does not feel oily like some moisturizers. The product does not rub off on the pillow.  I have combination  acne prone skin type. Very sensitive skin. I have to be very careful about what I put on my face  especially now that I m trying out a new acne cream that s drying out my face like crazy. A friend of mine who has similar skin type as I do recommended this sleeping pack to me  and I m glad I have tried it out. It definitely locked the moisture into my skin during the night. It does not work right away  but it feels good on my skin and after a few days  my skin feels and looks more hydrated and healthy. It has NOT broken me out. It has not dried out my skin in anyway. I don t know if it is supposed to do this  but I think some of my dark pigmentations have faded some what. Pretty cool. I d recommend this product.
8451,Samsam1214,1,05-May-14,,This was my first time using a sleeping pack and I liked it. I don t like how my face feels kindof sticky and I have to be careful to not rub it all on my pillow if I sleep sideways  but it does moisturize my face well.

8464,Ria.M,1,27-Jul-16,3 people found this helpful,I only recently started experimenting with Korean skin care products  and decided to give this one a try since I had heard good things about it from beauty blogs and it had so many good reviews. I am very impressed with my first couple uses! It feels wonderful when you first smooth it on  and it absorbs pretty quickly. The next morning though  it left my skin amazingly moisturized and refreshed  plumper and more hydrated. I use a lot of moisturizers  from Paula s Choice to Dermalogica to different oils and butters  but none of them has left me with such dramatically good results. This stuff is going to be a staple for me from now on.
8465,Masuka Magambo,1,27-Apr-17,,Feels great already. Can t wait to see how it feels in the morning. Smells awesome.
8466,Ocularopeoia,1,18-Jan-14,3 people found this helpful,Goes on very smooth and feels great on the face. You don t need a lot for it to work. I have acne prone skin and am getting dried out to the point of flaky skin because of all those acne creams  (I have sensitive skin). Using this product my skin stays soft and hydrated and the redness of my acne goes down. I notice the pores are smaller  and overall skin color is much whiter  and brighter. It doesn t have reaction with my other night creams too which is amazing. This will make your skin soft  brighter  and help maintain moisture  and as with everything you need to use a couple times to see results. Creams aren t laser face surgery they take time.
8467,Li Sun,1,25-Jan-15,,I have to say this is the best water sleeping musk ever! I have used three or four of them! It is super popular in China and all other Asian countries. Whenever I am exhausted and too tired to put on toner  serum and then lotion  I would put this on my face and it take good care of it. I love this product and will continousely buying it.

8474,drwiren,1,06-Oct-16,2 people found this helpful,Love love love. Definitely moisturizes and makes my skin plump and bouncy the next morning. And I think it helps brighten my complexion too. I use it 1-2 times a week  especially when my skin looks tired and dull. I do the 10-step korean skincare once a week and use this sleeping mask as the last step before going to bed. The smell is definitely relaxing. I took away one star just because it gets quite... sticky? It tells you to use a thin layer  but it does take a while to absorb into the skin (but I guess it s supposed to be that way since it s a sleeping mask). But as a consequence though  it feels uncomfy when I put my face on the pillow because of the stickiness... And i cant sleep on my back. But I dont care! Still love the results and will continue using!
8475,Tricia,1,27-Feb-16,20 people found this helpful,I absolutely love this product. I just got it and have been using it for three days and I can see the results! My skin loves it so much it just drinks it up! The packaging is nice and simple  it comes with a little spoon to scoop out the product (keeping it clean). When I apply it at night before bed  it had a cool sensation which feels great. The product isn t too thick  it s a bit watery and a little goes a long way so don t apply too much on your face. I haven t broken out since using this and it doesn t leave any irritation on my skin. I love using this and I am definitely repurchasing this again for myself and probably for my mom too.
8476,Amazon Kunde,1,16-Nov-17,,Very good Product. It is good on sensitive skin and it helps making the skin feel soft and clear. I love it! The amount of this mask is probably more than enough for more than a month.
8477,hagana kim,1,22-Jan-16,,Leaves your skin feeling plump and hydrated! Love it!  I have sensitive skin and love this mask!
8478,Jay,1,22-Nov-15,,This stuff is great for short sleep nights  leaves your skin well hydrated all night.
8479,Hilary,1,27-Apr-16,4 people found this helpful,I read about this as a great moisturizing mask when you re on a plane. I travel a good amount and also thought if it works great in that dry climate  it should be even better when I m home. I m 47 and my neck was starting to show the years. I ve been using it a few weeks now and the lines in my neck have improved greatly. I m starting to use it on my face day and night and my skin is getting softer every day.
8480,Febrina,1,13-Jan-17,,Moist my skin  giving a plump and soft feeling when you wake up. Love it!
8481,Lydia L.,1,01-Feb-14,One person found this helpful,super moisturizing! I apply a layer on my skin at the end of my beauty routine on nights when my skin is extra dry and the next morning it s all soft. I recommend it.
8482,Megan,1,13-Jul-13,,The item got to me way early than the expecting date and the product it self was super amazing. The mask really helps to get my skin soft and smooth. The light rose smell relax my body too. Recommend buying

8484,Twyla Zhang,1,20-Dec-17,,Pretty good. I love this
8485,Joyce,1,16-Nov-15,,I love this cream. It has put great moisture back into my skin.
8486,Alysa L,1,23-Jan-16,,ITS VERY HYDRATING BUT WATCH OUT IF YOU BREAK OUT EASILY!!JUST LIKE ME...
8487,Claire Chang,1,31-Jul-17,,With this  it s so easy as adding some more moisturizer to your routine!
8488,christina raspono,1,29-Oct-15,,I love it light and very nice for my skin it s worth it
8489,crzyswtgirol,1,03-Jul-14,,Formula is perfect - relieves puffiness and makes skin feels smooth and soft. Best to apply at night since it is thick and does not absorb quickly into the skin.
8490,Storm,1,21-Mar-16,2 people found this helpful,Does everything it claims. Makes the skin soft and glowing. Absolutely in love with this!
8491,nc shopper,1,14-Nov-13,One person found this helpful,It smells great. The texture is lovely. However  my skin is very dry and I expected a little more moisturizing. This is probably better for those with oilier skin.
8492,Mallory,1,25-May-16,One person found this helpful,So far  all of the K-Beauty superstars I ve bought including this product have lived up to their hype. I didn t have high expectations for this product when I first got it - it is a lightweight gel formula and I thought it would probably just be an average product. I was so wrong!! Such a refreshing feeling putting this on  and the hydration is beautiful.  **These sleeping packs/aka moisturizer/mask hybrids go on after your moisturizer as a final step (I use this almost every night  some people use them only a few times a week). They are supposed to leave a sticky feeling. Let it soak in for 15-20 minutes (head off the pillow) before you go to sleep.
8493,Sheep meiemei,1,23-Aug-17,,LOVE IT
8494,ghosts,1,06-Apr-17,,This takes a while to absorb into my skin  but it s light and not greasy  so that s a plus. I m using an array of kbeauty products these days so I can t speak to individual ones that well  but I have not had any negative effects from this.  My skin is (was?) oily and highly sensitive. Testing new products was like walking in a breakout mine field. I haven t had any new pimples since I started using this and my skin is very soft  smooth  and supple.  The pack itself has a smooth jellyish texture and is faintly blue. It goes on easily and looks wet for a while  til it absorbs. Afterward my skin is all dewy and I have to force myself not to touch it.  (Seriously  I ve never has skin this soft that STAYED this soft.)  I find it funny that the packaging recommends you smell it to unwind; it doesn t smell bad probably  but I am just not a fan of the scent.
8495,Healthnut24,1,31-May-17,,Perfect!!!
8496,Wynn,1,19-Sep-16,One person found this helpful,Feels great upon application. Leaves face looking and feeling refreshed in the morning.
8497,Weng Foong Yap,1,03-Oct-16,,Love it but it has a very strong perfume smell.
8498,Jacqueline( American ),1,28-Jan-14,One person found this helpful,smells great! very soothing. but i don t think it s moisturizing enough for me. I used to use Water Sleeping Pack at night and when i wake up in the morning  skin feels and looks great.
8499,V Hamilton,1,17-Jan-18,,I wake up with fresh looking skin!
8500,Krystal k,1,09-Jun-15,,I love this stuff it makes my skin soft and radiant in the morning
8501,MeMe,1,22-Nov-16,11 people found this helpful,Fabulous night mask! I have Dry (in winter) sensitive skin with hormonal breakouts. I always struggle to find a night cream that hydrates without causing breakouts. This is PERFECT! i wake up with hydrated skin  not greasy and i haven t experienced any breakouts from it.
8502,DE,1,26-Oct-16,,awsome！
8503,Amazon Customer,1,05-Sep-17,,Love love love this product!
8504,Sabrina,1,08-Jun-13,,I brought it by accident  but really amazed me. The product is so good  easy to apply. perfect product for lazy people like me. just put it on and sleep  the next day you can feel the skin is so smooth and filled with water.
8505,Illyum,1,16-May-14,One person found this helpful,bought this as a gift for my mom because I had no actual time to bring it to her myself. came on time and is exactly what I asked for.
8506,Sarah chang,1,04-Nov-16,,Made me break out
8507,Winnie,1,22-Jun-14,One person found this helpful,I decided to try a bottle after my friend recommended this product to me. My facial skin is very dry and sensitive. It s almost impossible to switch products as my skin is allergic to most of them. I liked this product in the first place. You immediately feel the moisturizing effect. However  after using this product for a few days  my skin felt dry when I woke up in the middle of the night. I decided to switch back to my original product eventually.  However  my mom used this product and fell in love with it. She thought it made her skin my refreshing and energetic. She got some compliments from colleagues for her skin. I think this products works well on most people with dry to normal skin. But if you re the extremely dry and sensitive type like me  you might want to doublethink.
8508,Kip,1,09-Nov-14,,I continue to use this and the firming sleeping pack. Great for keeping my skin hydrated.
8509,Amazon Customer,1,28-Feb-18,,So Hydrating! It sinks into the skin and gives you a glow!
8510,wenjie,1,09-Feb-16,,good.
8511,Alan B.,1,01-May-17,,I like it a lot
8512,Hello Kitty,1,19-Apr-13,,i have not use it so far  but I used it a lot when I was in china  sells even more expensive than here. And other mask from same brand is called something strawberry yogurt mask  which also great. great Korean product that truly hydrate ur skin while sleeping. Alcohol free and good on all types of skin. Highly recommendation. And it s cheap.
8513,Chih-Wei Cheng,1,30-Jul-13,One person found this helpful,Thank you so much. i Received it two days ago. And it s really good product. I just use it yesterday.
8514,Blue Wallaby,1,11-Jul-17,,Very soothing/fun to apply and I definitely see results! Will keep purchasing in the future.
8515,Alexandrina,1,13-Apr-15,,Very refreshing. Very light. Not for super dry skin though  unless you layer it with something thicker.
8516,Pro Y,1,25-Nov-15,,The best skin care mask I used
8517,pamela abels,1,13-Jan-16,,Love this stuff. Rich moisture. Makes my skin dewy. Will buy again. I have sensitive skin and this is a great product for me so far.
8518,CocoChanel,1,16-Jan-16,,My skin is more moist and smooth
8519,Amazon Customer,1,22-Sep-16,,great
8520,DEBRA Regent,1,20-Oct-16,,A very good Product
8521,Pisces,1,29-May-18,One person found this helpful,Love this stuff. You only need a little bit  i would say my first jar lasted me about 3-4 months  well worth the price. You have to let it dry down for about 5 mins before you lay your head on the pillow but the results are great. I wake up with nice  smooth  glowing skin. I only use it maybe 4 times a week  everyday is not not essential. I don’t have problem skin so I can’t say good it would work for acne or something like that  but for the winter months of dry skin this is a lifesaver.
8522,Tram Tran,1,08-May-14,,This product makes my skin feels nice and soft in the morning. I will definitely buy this product again in the future.
8523,Kaytee,1,09-Mar-18,,I had a MASSIVE pimple on the side of my face  and after popping it and cleaning it out  I put some ointment on it. Once I was done with that  I put the Water Sleeping mask on my face  and left it. The scent is amazing- smells clean  very lightweight  and not sticky at all. The next morning  I woke up  looked at my face and was AMAZED by how VIBRANT and NOURISHED my skin looked. I traveled recently  and my skin was breaking out and looked very dull. I was wary because of the hype  but it s literally one of the most amazing things ever. I can t wait to keep using it and am kind of sad it only says to use 1-2xs a week because I want my skin to look this good everyday. An added plus- the packaging is so cute and chic. I do know a lot about skincare (S. Korean and always trying different creams and nourishing stuff)  so I feel like this is one of the best things ever.
8524,L. Rivera,1,12-Apr-17,,This mask works well. Will be buying again.
8525,Kirsten Weis,1,22-Sep-16,,Really nice overnight mask
8526,hailey,1,21-Apr-14,,Love this product. :) makes my skin look healthy  smooth and bright. Sucks it says u should onpy apply it 1-2times.
8527,Beauty Addict,1,05-Feb-16,One person found this helpful,This is magical moisture in a jar! This is the first sleeping mask that I have ever used so I can t compare it to anything else  but I am in love with it. My skin can become red and flaky during the Winter months and this stuff has been a face saver. I have slept in it and have also worn it for an hour and then removed it. Either way  I ve had great results. The next day your skin will feel so soft and back to life. I would recommend this for anyone with oily skin and I doubt that I will use it during the Summer months. But for now...it s wonderful.
8528,Yilena,1,02-Feb-14,2 people found this helpful,I have been using masks for a quite a while  and I used many different kinds/forms of masks. I came across this product when I search for a moisturize night cream for my sometime-dry skin. This sleeping pack is very easy to apply  watery (not greasy at all) and so absorb really fast. Sometimes I put another layer according to the condition of my skin  and it feels really nice. Plus the scent is very pleasant  not very bold but soothing. My face feels so soft and smooth when I wake up after putting them on  so I use it every night now.  This is my first time using Laneige s product  and I love it. They also have a strawberry repair sleeping pack  I want to try that one too.
8529,FaLa,1,19-Jun-16,6 people found this helpful,So I originally got a small sample of this sleeping pack from a magazine advert. I took it out with the intention to use it  but never really got around to it. Fast forward a few weeks pf being thrown around and I finally decide to try it on. At the time  I didn t have a regular skin care routine  but my face was so soft and supple the morning after I used the sample that I went and bought this jar of it.  The packaging is really nice and comes with a plastic spoon (you can use and wash it with soap). It also comes with English instructions  as well as other languages. A little bit of this product goes a veryyyy long way  which is why I deemed this a good price. Additionally  I do go a bit against the instructions: I layer on all of my moisturizers before putting the pack on (but allow them to dry!!!) AND I ve found this gentle enough to put on and around my eyes without any pain/stinging.
8530,Thalia Cepeda,1,21-Jul-15,,Very hydrating especially in the winter
8531,Caroline,1,02-Sep-15,,I love it! It moisturizes my skin so well. Just for reference  I have sensitive  combination skin and it doesn t break me out.
8532,Amazon Customer,1,30-Jun-17,2 people found this helpful,So not only does this make my face crazy soft and bright in the morning but the smell guys.. laneige developed a special  sleep scent  for this mask and I kid you not it knocks me out so fast its incredible. I don t know it s chloroform mixed with lavender but I honestly don t care  it s so good. I put it on ten minutes ago and my eyes are having trouble staying open as I type this. And I know when I wake up in the morning my skin will look flawless so it s a win win. Just get it unless your sensitive to smells and have an aversion to soft glowy skin and a good nights sleep.
8533,Amazon Customer,1,08-Jul-16,,Great product.
8534,Litto,0,07-Mar-18,2 people found this helpful,Worst product I have used on my face in a long time. Recently I have been hating my skin. Not sure if its the weather or what.. I loved that this said  Renewal  and I was in the market looking for a sleep mask. What a JOKE this stuff is. It dries right down so your face just feels dry and sticky right after applying. I just couldn t sit with it on my skin and had to wash it off. Used it one time and it is now in the trash. Also  it took 5 days to get here and was supposed to be amazon prime. I wish it would have never come.
8535,Sean,1,14-Jun-15,,feels good  but haven t noticed any difference.
8536,Chemicallykilled,1,10-Mar-15,,I LOVE this product  seriously lol. Its a light gel  with a blue tint. No odor  arrived in reasonable time in an undamaged package.  This is to be used at night before bed  as cells turn over and the body heals best when sleeping. It does not take a lot at all to cover the face well  its a light gel and dries quickly - leaving a refreshing cool effect on my face. The next day  my face is baby-soft. I have seen results with this within a single use and since not much is required to get the job done - I can see myself using this religiously for a long time and continuing to use it after I deplete this order!
8537,Amazon Customer,1,24-Apr-17,,I like it  light on skin and full of moisture.
8538,Lois,1,24-Oct-17,,Like to put it over moisturizer at night or by itself.
8539,Rachel,1,06-Mar-16,,Makes my skin soft and hydrated in the morning.
8540,CurlyTop,1,02-Mar-16,One person found this helpful,This is a good sleeping mast for intense hydration. It did not work very well for me though - i am in my 40s with combination skin  prone to occasional pimples. The one time i used it  i think it gave me a pimple. So it was just sitting on my counter for a while. Then i gave it to my mom  who is in her 70s. She loves it and has been using it regularly - when she uses it  she says her skin is hydrated and smooth and soft in the morning. I took a star off because my own experience was not that great.

8546,Q. Yang,1,06-May-14,,I love the fragrance of this! It is so light weight  and quite moisturizing. I don t think my skin has changed a whole lot  but it is pleasant to use.
8547,zhp_321,1,18-May-15,,good  like the unique smell.
8548,LyndaEllard,1,17-May-16,One person found this helpful,When I first used this I was worried because of how thin the consistency felt but once I applied it onto my face  the product almost immediately act like a film of water seal on your skin. The product maintains its moisture throughout the night and not sticky or gooey feeling at all. It s it really like an invisible mask! My skin feels hydrated and plumped after washing my face in the mornings. Love this stuff. I have sensitive to dry skin and this works well with any skin type.
8549,soso,1,04-Feb-14,,great this is useful for me. because i need this thing long time  and it is great. really good thing
8550,ilona mc nabb,1,26-Jul-16,,I love it.. Awesome for my dry skin.. a little goes a long way..I can only recommend all the products.
8551,Michaela Francisco,1,30-Apr-13,One person found this helpful,If you take a shower and open your pores with the steam and hot water  put this on your face before you leave the bathroom  then go straight to sleep  your skin will glow and be soo hydrated. It does not make your face oily either and does not clog pores.
8552,real user,1,27-Sep-12,,very nice. i like the smell and the way it makes my skin feel. will definitely recommend and probably repurchase.

8558,Magz Faux,1,23-Jul-14,,So effective. You wake up with baby skin.
8559,T3,1,30-Nov-16,,I ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and I think the experience of using this mask is nice. While I don t the active ingredients are penetrating through the skin  because you should using moisturizer underneath  and the constantly exposure to air diminishes the potency of the product  the product does provide a nice protective layer to dry air. Yes you could use vaseline instead as its comedogenic  but I find this just feels a lot better. The scent.. yeah you ll smell like your aunt  but I don t really mind. I find my skin absorbs just enough of it and the morning after  I don t experience my skin peeling anymore.
8560,Mindee Ly,1,15-Mar-16,6 people found this helpful,It really moisturizes your skin  leaving your skin looking amazing. I have dry patches around my nose and in between my brows  and this product really hydrated those areas. Product came with a spatula and a small pamphlet with instructions. :) New holy grail!
8561,Connie Kang,1,16-Jan-15,,It was good.
8562,JoanMM,1,09-May-13,,My friend who is originally from Korea brought this back from there and I really liked it and was happy to find it on Amazon when I ran out. It is so cooling and rich that it feels great when you apply it.

8567,Amazon Customer,1,20-Jul-16,7 people found this helpful,This is my first sleeping pack I have ever tried and I m glad I read into all the reviews and raves about this product and brand because I have found nothing but good things. All other sleeping packs I compare to this one and love the smell  which is big because fragrance is usually what I stay away from. It truly plumps your skin full of moisture and helps with the texture even in rough places like the tops of the cheeks and forehead which for me show a lot of pores and bumps under makeup. I also love that is comes with a little spatula for hygiene. I use this over my full routine about 2-3 times a week.
8568,Yun H Chang,1,22-Apr-16,,I like this product a lot more than I expected. It s not an overnight magic cream but I think I got what I paid for and more. The mask goes on very lightly and doesn t break me out. The texture is very similar to much hyped Biotherm Moisturizer and my skin absorbed the mask pretty quickly. I was worried about getting the mask all over my pillow but that didn t happen. Like I said the mask didn t transform my skin overnight but it is moisturized. The shipping was pretty quick too. Thank you.
8569,Jennifer,1,19-Oct-14,,I love it :) It works sooo well. I dont use it that often  but on the nights that i do use it  my skin feels great the next morning!

8574,Natalia,1,27-Apr-18,4 people found this helpful,Laneige sleep mask has a great reputation. From the 1st use I saw immediate results. It s the last step in my layering and it feels cold  is gel texture and it just feels so fresh. I skip eye cream and moisturizer when I use this  i use the sleep mask under the eyes (the instructions recommend this) and as my skin absorbs all the goodness it feels happier and happier. when i wake up the next morning the skin texture is smooth  and very plump  especially under my eyes which i love! Also my skin looks very even and bright. I have brown skin and this products works great to correct hyper-pigmentation almost immediately like Chica y Chico (but without that weird cyc white cast obviously) but does not effect my beautiful brown skin. so no skin bleaching! the only thing that would make this product a little better is if the scent was a little milder or softer. However  i can t wait for the next laneige sleep mask night =D

I ordered several as gifts when I saw how well it works - & so easy to apply. Then I ordered the Laneige day/night cream which is due to arrive tomorrow!! After using the sleeping mask  I m excited to try the cream which I can leave on as a day moisturizer  absolutely- I recommend the sleeping mask!!! Results as promised!

8580,CookieMonsterSchwartz,1,30-May-17,One person found this helpful,An excellent night occlusive layer to lock in moisture. However  I m taking off 1 star for the scent. Scents are very subjective; the instructions suggest you take a whiff to help lull you to sleep- I d rather it be scentless or at least lose the sandalwood- I think it makes it smell like plastic.
8581,Amazon Customer,1,13-Jul-16,,very good!
8582,A.C.,1,12-Jan-16,,The scent is on the verge of being overwhelming to me (I m very sensitive to product smells) even though it is pleasant  but I ll happily deal with it because this cream is fantastic for my dehydrated skin. The very first time I used it  I noticed that when I woke up  my facial skin was visibly hydrated and plumped up  minimizing wrinkles and looking fresh and healthy. Great value for the money. I have used much more expensive creams from department store brands and not been impressed like I was with this cream.
8583,Amazon Customer,1,17-Jun-16,,Comfortable
8584,A,1,17-Jan-17,2 people found this helpful,I love this! This is my second bottle. A coworker gave me the first one when I told her how dry my skin was getting with winter. This feels wonderful! I put it on at night and in the morning  my skin feels like a babies bottom! I even had my boyfriend try it and he commented on how refreshing it felt. I ve been using it for over 6 months and have not had a single breakout.. just compliments on how great my skin looks :-)
8585,Elizabeth Winckelmann,1,28-Mar-16,One person found this helpful,I liked this face wash but found that during the harsh winter it did not keep my face moisturized over night.  During the summer Its great- slightly more on the light sheen side than heavy lotion. Like it...but don t expect it to keep up with the dry winter.  I would possibly order again  but I found that I would wake up in the middle of the night and throw on another layer because my face would feel dry again.
8586,Donna J. Harris,1,13-Jun-15,,Great stuff for a reasonable price.
8587,Integrity,1,01-Dec-15,5 people found this helpful,I recently bought this product and although I was bit skeptical about it at first and thought it is just like any other product out there with big promises but little results. Let me tell you  I have been using this product for a week now  and I can feel and see how good my skin feels. I have wore it under makeup as a primer/moisturizer and it works just as good. The skin feels hydrated and well nourished after application. I can absolutely recommend it to any skin types assuming that it works well for oily skin then it can works well for dry and combination skin types. The smell is light but its a refreshing smell and i can compare it with spring valley smell  overall it is a great product to own.
8588,dezireviews,0,25-Nov-16,One person found this helpful,There was so much hype for this mask so I finally gave in and bought it  despite it being much pricier than I would usually pay for a face mask. It broke me out  small little bumps all over my skin. I m sure it works for many people  I m dissapointed it didn t work for me.
8589,Ross,1,09-Mar-17,2 people found this helpful,I cannot live without this product. I use it two to three times a week  and my skin has never been better. Breakouts have decreased in frequency and intensity  my skin is softer and smoother  the product smells nice and is completely fool proof. I almost don t want to recommend this because I don t want my supply to be threatened  but this is a skincare essential.
8590,Stephanie P. Mitchell,1,06-Apr-17,2 people found this helpful,I used it everyday and OMG it is the most moisturizing thing on Earth. I use it every night instead of just three times a week. My skin is noticeably dewier 
8591,Ybw,1,13-Jul-15,,Good product with good price from Amazon!

8593,Jun Young Hwang,1,07-Oct-15,,good
8594,Jonathan Choi,1,13-Feb-17,,I can t vouch for this product alone as I bought other toners and essence with this product. I use this 3 times a week and I think it does improve my facial skin tone. Next morning after using this  my face does feel a bit smoother  but it s not a huge difference. I have been using it for 3 weeks and since I don t use it everyday  I think this bottle can last months before I go through it
8595,Nick&Laura,1,26-Feb-17,,I love it! It really brightens your skin right away! It s easy to apply and it doesn t feel sticky. You do have to let it dry first  which doesn t take too long but definitely don t wait right before to apply it. Give yourself some time for it to dry.  It does come in a small container but only apply it 2 to 3 times a week and you don t need much for it to spread all over your face so it should last a while!  Definitely recommend it!
8596,Jennifer Pearson,1,14-Jul-16,5 people found this helpful, Wow!  is all I can think to say of this incredible product! It melts into your face in no time - feels great on skin  dewy complexion in the morning - I am already on: 3rd bottle and will not stop there! Moreover  it smells absolutely: Incredible!!! the all-natural ingredients that comprise this sleeping mask actually end up luring one to sleep! I wear it after washing face - under and eye-mask and wake up looking so healthy! I too expect great things from lip mask I just ordered - You just have to experience this lovely user-friendly product vs frightening  chemical-filled ones like the new: Olay mask for instance. Many imitations or other brand s versions will no doubt appear - but I found: 1st one @target and am thrilled to discover here on my favorite: amazon.com (:
8597,Jessica,1,06-Jun-13,One person found this helpful,This is my second time purchasing this product; my first one lasted over a year. My skin tends to get very dry easily  so I apply this every night after I ve taken a shower and used toner. It smells great and it always leaves my skin super soft. It s not super oily either(I absolutely hate oily lotions). And although this really has nothing to do with the product s quality  I really love the light blue color of the cream! Amazing product  will buy again when this one runs out!

8599,Jessica Gomez,0,05-Jul-16,6 people found this helpful,I was so excited about this product. The first night using it was nice  I woke up with very soft moisturized skin the next morning. On the second day i began to break out all over my face  which is very uncommon for me. i was trying out a few new products at the same time so I used this one for a solid week. After finding a new set of blemishes on my face every day I had to stop using it.... really bummed out... Not for me
8600,bluehawaii65,1,24-Sep-16,23 people found this helpful,I did a lot of research before I bought this product. I was a little skeptical because I can only buy this product via Amazon or online Target. Not able to see/test it in a physical store really makes things hard to grasp. Once I started using it  I was absolutely amazed by this product. I just finished the whole jar and planned to buy another one  I think it is worth sharing some insights about this product.  My skin type: It looks like combination/oily skin but feels very dry in the morning and at night especially after the shower. (Age: 25-30) Suggestion: -Think the Sleeping mask as an add-on that you put on your face the last step before you sleep. Never replace your regular routine with it.  It s very hard to describe how hydrating this product is but to give you some examples of what other products that I have tried to combat dehydration. Everything I wrote here is based on my skin type and personal experience. I m like a big fan of Origins so I ll start from here. Compare to Origins Energy-boosting moisturizer: They both have gel texture with cooling effects on the face but Laneige s hydrating effect lasts longer than the Energy-boosting moisturizer. I feel refreshed and hydrated the next day  Compare to Origins Make a Difference Plus+ Rejuvenating treatment($43): This Origins product definitely helped with my dehydration problem but I had to use a lot because it is a cream-based moisturizer. The gel-based sleeping mask is easier to spread on the face. The Origins product is like twice as much as the price of Laneige but half of the amount.  Pro: -Reasonable price: Good sleeping mask for anybody like me not able to spend hundreds of dollars on moisturizers/sleeping masks (bought one at $25  now it went down to $19.88) - Feel hydrated through the night. It does what you ask it for.  Con: -Dependence: I don t know if this is a con but I started using it once a week then I had to use it every night otherwise my whole face feels tight.

8602,breanna,1,15-Mar-16,,This is legitimately awesome. It smells very lightly scented but it is a refreshing scent that is only a hint floral. I actually see a difference in my skin in the morning in that it doesn t feel tight or parched  nor does it feel greasy or oily.

8605,Iota of Genius,1,17-Jan-17,4 people found this helpful,The most amazing sleep mask I have had so far (and I have way too many). When they say its Water sleeping mask then they mean Water sleeping mask. It has super thin consistency and my face absorbs all of it really fast. I use it with Missha snail renew cream and love the dewy skin I wake up with in the morning. I sometimes use a very thin layer of it in the morning but I always use a sunscreen (Neogen or Missha) as it won t? give you any sun protection that is part of a normal day cream

8608,KimmyM,1,10-Jan-14,5 people found this helpful,This product is great if you are looking for something to apply overnight for extra moisturizing effect  I don t use it every night  only during those nights when I need the extra moisture  it s the gel like texture that goes on just as water on your skin and it smells good. Put this on after you apply all of the other products that you use regularly as your night routine  and you will wake up the next morning feeling your skin pumped up with more water  but for those with really sensitive skin and cannot use any product that contains fragrance  this might not be the product for you.

8619,Libra Moon,1,20-Jun-13,,I ve heard several great things about this product so I decided to try it  plus the fact that I suffer from dry skin sometimes. I ve only tried it once  but the next morning my face felt refreshed and healthier. Also  most of the dryness had gone away. The one thing about this  since it s recommended for use before bed  is that unless you normally sleep on your back  you have to train yourself to. It doesn t absorb totally (takes all night) so a little gets on the pillow. Other than that it s wonderful. The jar is quite large as well  and you don t need to use it everyday which means it ll last a while so the price doesn t seem so expensive.
8620,Nik,1,18-Apr-17,,Really nice moisturizer for night. I have oily skin and find it very refreshing. In the winter months  I actually needed something a tad heavier so would use with another product if you are especially needing more.

8630,Mpls_Kiki,0,21-Aug-15,3 people found this helpful,Read great reviews of this on a beauty website that touted using it before international flights to keep moisturized. I travel frequently for work so was excited to try it. I don t find it very hydrating  rather than feeling creamy it feels really light and leaves my skin a bit sticky. On the couple occasions I have used it at home  I find I have very irritated eyes in the morning. It does have a pleasant smell - maybe a better product for someone who has oilier skin.
8631,Allie S-R,1,28-Jul-17,2 people found this helpful,I use this as a mask over my Neutrogena hydro gel moisturizer and when i wake up in the morning my skin is so plump. Note: you must make sure you don t wear this during the day and you have to make sure to get all of this mask off first this in the morning or it will cause break outs... it s meant as a night mask only
8632,T. Loi,1,30-Nov-12,5 people found this helpful,This is great for the value of the money. I love love love this product. I live in NE of US  so winter can be really cold. These are great moisture for the face. My winter go-to winter moisture was Dr. Ci:labo Aqua-collagen-gel Super Moisture Moisturizer. But with a limited budget this yr. I m so glad I found this product since it work as great as Dr. Ci:labo product.  I have acne but dry sensitive skin. I m using this product on after I apply my prescribed acne med. The acne med suppose to dry my skin out  with this on  it doesn t dry out my skin at all.  Highly recommended.
8633,KSK,1,29-Apr-15,,Super moisturizing gel that also cools the skin. I only use it once a week because I m scared of breakouts but that one night is enough. I have been putting in on under a clean disposable cloth mask and falling asleep with it. When I wake up my skin feels amazing

My experience has been quite the opposite. I used it twice since purchase and each time I noticed that my skin actually looked worse than the night before  not soft at all. I have stopped using it and gone back to my paper mask again which is much better. As soon as I switched back  my skin was much happier and so was I.

8642,kns,0,10-Dec-18,3 people found this helpful,Obvious  but be careful when you buy skincare from amazon. There’s no quality control  it’s just some rando shipping stuff from their old  filthy warehouse or basement. My friend was using this one that she bought here and said it was crap. I gave her the last bit of my almost empty jar I’d gotten from Sephora (for $5 more and tons of free deluxe samples from the app’s promo codes). The jar had been open for almost a year. It had had tons of time to get old. She loved it  and I saw her skin the next morning  it was great. Who knows what crap she had been putting on her skin before. Saving $5 isn’t worth that risk. =/
8643,DLS Jones,1,03-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,I have been using this sleeping mask for about 2 years. My DIL gave me a mini size in my Xmas stocking and once i tried it  I fell in love. At night  I am too tired to go through a lot of skin care steps (but I ALWAYS take my makeup off)  so I use this sleeping mask followed by a light layer of tamanu oil on my face  neck and d?colletage and then two drops of rose hip oil on my lids and around my eyes. That’s all I do. Just 3 products. But the transformation of my mature skin has been nothing short of incredible. I do let the sleeping mask dry down completely before doing the light layer of tamanu oil/rose hip oil. I usually wash my face around 10 pm and then apply the sleeping mask afterward. I hit the sack about an hour later and do the two oils. I don’t really want to use the word miraculous because it sounds inflated  after all how can just three products make my skin look plumper  younger and healthier than the 6-7 steps I was doing previously  including retin A (which btw doesn’t work for everyone). I suffer from occasional facial excema and the tamanu oil has not only completely healed it but has kept it at bay such that I haven’t had a breakout since i started using the tamanu oil. I started out just using these two oils and the result were very good. However  adding the layer of the laneige sleeping mask has boosted the glow and has helped smooth the texture in a major way. I have used the sleeping mask alone  as just one step and yes  it’s really really great. But adding these two oils has made all the difference. I have tried many  anti aging  creams over the last decade  one of which was $250 and didn’t absolutely nothing. I read about rosehip oil for dry flaky skin  which is the issue i had (yes past tense) on my lids and undereye area  although the rest of my face is quite oily  even after menopause. I started using rosehip oil around my eyes and within 2 weeks of nightly use  the flakes on my lids disapeared and the undereye fine lines were plump and much less noticeable. And the benefits have continued to get better and better such that my dermatologist said that I definitely do NOT need Botox (or a facelift  yet  lol!). I was using the laneige sleeping mask and rosehip oil every night and then started getting a weird red rash on either side of my lips and on my chin. So I searched Amazon for excema/psoriasis treatments and tamanu oil popped up. Because I’ve had such fantastic results with rosehip oil  I decided to try it. Yes  it’s a weird greenish color and initially it has a rather strong scent but that dissipates within 30 seconds. It’s thicker than rosehip oil so it takes a full dropper to cover my face  neck and d?colletage. But adding tamanu oil  which keeps the polyenesian women wrinkle free even into very old age  has bumped up the effects of the laneige sleeping mask and rosehip oil around my eyes. Every time I see a commercial/ad for expensive creams promising  anti aging  ingredients  I have to laugh. I fell for those marketing claims for years but never saw much improvement  even using so called  luxury  brands. My mother always told me to wash my face at night no matter how tired I might be. She encouraged me to take skin care seriously and I remember going to the store with her to buy my first Clinique 3 step set of products. When my mother passed  she didn’t have a single wrinkle  a testament to her lifelong skin care routine. She used the Roc retinol products (serum  moisturizer and eye cream)  a very inexpensive line. She was a living example that you don’t need to spend a small fortune to have healthy  glowing  beautiful skin (at any age). The Laneige sleeping mask is reasonably priced and does last quite some time. I go through about 3 jars per year  using it nightly. My DIL has very dry skin as well as acne scars and she has started doing my routine with the two oils and the sleeping mask and after only one month  I can definitely see a huge difference. Tamanu oil is also amazing for scars and smooths texture incredibly well. I know that keeping up with this routine  I will continue to see great results. I know this is supposed to be a review solely for the sleeping mask but for many women  this is not enough. I will also say that this 3 product routine has normalized my skin’s oil production such that I no longer have to worry about my makeup sliding off during the day. My skin is perfectly normal now  no dry patches or super gross slimy oily ones either. The sleeping mask helps cell turnover and the oils provide hydration. I will say that I also really like the Prem Radiance Peeling Sleeping Pack  which is a Korean line available at Target and around the same price as Laneige. I have started alternating between the Laneige and Prem and am seeing even better results. Once a week I use The Ordinary Alpha Lipoic Acid treatment  followed by the two oils. Everyone knows that The Ordinary is a very affordable skin care brand that uses only ingredients that have been scientifically PROVEN to be effective. I just thought it was important to mention that I don’t use the laneige sleeping mask on its own. But when I did  I did see a major difference.
8644,Margaret,1,21-Jun-15,4 people found this helpful,I recently bought this product at a local Target store. I am so glad that it was sold there and that I didn t have to order it online and wait for it to arrive in the mail. It is pretty inexpensive in my opinion. I have combination dry and oily skin  and very prone to breakouts. I m pretty hesitant to try moisturizing products on my skin because of how shiny my skin gets soon after but I saw great reviews about this product so I decided to give it a try and I have to say that I love this thing! I saw results the very next day! My skin became incredible smooth  soft  not dry at all (and I think my skin was less shiny the whole next day). I washed my face and applied it on at night  after my toner. It felt very nice and cold when I applied it onto my face. I didn t really notice a difference right after I applied it so I was a little bummed about that. But when I woke up and washed my face... WOW! My skin was incredible soft and moisturized!!! I had not dry patchy parts on my face. It was easier for me to apply my make up. And I checked my skin while at work and it wasn t as shiny as usual! I love this product. I am so impressed! The directions say to only use it once or twice a week so I m a little bummed about that. If they said to use it every night or as much as I want to then I would seriously use it every night  haha  so I am just limiting myself to using it twice a week. If you have combination dry and oily skin  where your skin is dry and flaky but super shiny at the same time too then I think you should definitely give this product a try. It moisturizes your skin so that it s no longer dry without causing your skin to become greasy (maybe because it s a water sleeping mask?). I love it! Thank you for having it at Target!

8646,Amber H.,1,30-Jul-14,,This stuff is liquid gold.  I bought this last year and I *STILL* have tons of it. It only takes a tiny bit on your pinkie. What I do is I get a bit on my pinkie  then dot my forehead  cheeks and chin. Once you start rubbing it in  you ll see why you only need a minimal amount - it s VERY moisturizing! I apply this after washing my face  so my skin absorbs it almost immediately.  The only thing I will say  is that it may or may not make you break out (just from the sheer moisture aspect of it). I know some reviewers commented on the fact that it made them break out. I  personally  never had this problem. I don t recall ever getting a pimple from this stuff at all. One thing I d definitely recommend  is not using this in conjunction with heavy makeup products the next day (or ever  really). I d use a light to medium concealing BB/CC cream  as this Laneige product is heavy and really makes your skin soft. I found that wearing any Western type of concealer the next day REALLY dried my skin out. So  you can imagine how my skin my feel... going from super soft to super dried to  and then repeating that cycle. No doubt someone would get a zit!  Anyway  if you re on the edge of MAYBE purchasing this product  only do it to spoil yourself and not when you re going to break the bank. A typical moisturizer will work in the mean-time. If you ve got the money  BUY THIS. It s a great investment because unless you ve got twenty heads or plan on using it all over your body  it will last for months and months - I m going on year one as I type!
8647,H. S. Hayes,1,30-May-15,,It has a pleasant fresh floral smell with a hint of something sweet. Somehow it kind of reminds me of sweet-tarts although that is not exactly the smell. Maybe that hint of something sweet is fruit. It has a gel like consistency. It has a light smooth feel when applying it. It goes through a bit of a tacky stage as it drys on your skin. once it is completely absorbed that feeling disappears and leaves your skin feeling so soft. Even though it is inexpensive  when I put it on  it feels like a luxury. I noticed that a couple people said they breakout after using this. I can not imagine why anyone would breakout from this unless they were allergic to one of the ingredients. I have several allergies and sensitive skin and I have not had any issues like that with this product. When I run out  I will buy this again.
8648,Msyspencer,1,15-Sep-14,4 people found this helpful,I actually wanted this product so badly that I couldn t wait 2 days for shipping  and I bought it at Target. I was skeptical  judging by some of the bad reviews that said this mask doesn t do anything noticeable. I am such a sucker for Asian skincare products though  because I m half Chinese. I feel like no American/European products work well with my complexion and skin type. I bought a full line of Shiseido while in Hong Kong  and it s the only stuff of which I ve used up the whole bottle. I recently started using Differin gel (generic) and it makes my face flake like crazy. I m a 27 year old woman  I should not be having skin problems! :( Anyways. I put this mask on last night after cleansing and moisturizing. This morning  gave it a rinse  remoisturized  and my face feels pretty good! No flakes in sight. No redness either  another worry of mine after reading reviews. My pores look much smaller  and my skin feels firm but not tight. I ll be using this mask once or twice a week. I ll update if it starts to irritate  but so far  so good!  Oh  and I don t think this product would be useful for people with normal or oily skin. I think it s just designed for moisturizing super dry skin.
8649,judesneeds,1,26-Dec-14,3 people found this helpful,This has been my night time sleeping mask for 3 years now and counting. I m a college student with acne-prone and combination skin. The sleeping pack soothes my dry cheeks and does not cause my t-zone to over produce oil nor break out. I use it all year round but with a lighter hand in the summer because it s very moisturizing. Although it s pricy  80 mL is a lot  so I run out only once a year.  The sleeping pack has a very soothing and refreshing scent. The scent is meant to help you relax and destress as you take your time to apply your night time routine. How I apply it is after toner  serum  and emulsion  I take a dime size amount and dab it around my face. Then I smooth it on gently  and pat the product into my skin for absorption. ***Please note that this is NOT a moisturizer. It is a sleeping MASK. If you find it not moisturizing enough  it is because the sleeping pack is meant to be put on after all your toner  moisturizer  and cream to seal it all in your face at night. Then you wash it off in the morning. I know it sounds like chore  but I find it luxurious to take time on my face at night  because I treat it so roughly during the day: pollution  stress  make-up  sweat  and sun block.***

8651,Alisha,1,14-Mar-16,One person found this helpful,I have recently started changing up my skincare routine  and have incorporated some Asian beauty products that have been popular on the Asian beauty subreddit. This is the first one that I tried and I was expecting truly amazing results. Maybe my skin wasn t as dehydrated as I thought  or maybe I m not using it correctly. I do like the light smell very much  and the tiny spatula is delightful. I tend to spackle a dime^2 sized dollop onto my face and rub in only slightly. The product dries within a few minutes  and then you re supposed to go to bed. I don t feel it when it dries  and haven t noticed that the product has stained or rubbed off on my pillowcase. In the morning my skin is hydrated  but it could also be because I don t use this sleeping pack unless I ve done my other steps (cleanse  toner  mask sometimes  serum(s)  moisturizer) thoroughly. I do like the feeling of washing this off with water in the morning  because it feels gel-like again and makes me think it was working all night. Still  to be honest  I wasn t totally blown away like so many other people were. I think I need to look into different ways (layering? as a regular moisturizer?) that people have used this product with success in the past.

Maybe people are using way too much of this before bed or it s just not suitable for your skin type. If you put it in the fridge  it feels amazing when you use it on your face. I wake up the next morning and my skin is bright  glowing  and my pores look tiny.
8655,Vanessa,1,22-Jun-14,4 people found this helpful,I ve been looking for a good night cream to use that will really moisturize and revitalize my skin. After a lot of research I heard a lot of great reviews about this one. I have to add to those reviews and just say that this is amazing! The instructions say to use twice a week  so I use it on days I don t exfoliate. It comes with a little plastic scoop/spoon so that you don t need to dip your fingers into the product. It has a gel-like texture that feels like cool water when rubbed into the skin. It takes a little bit to massage it in but once it settles my skin has such a smooth  velvety texture and I wake up with bright  dewy looking skin! Definitely gonna keep using  would recommend.
8656,TheShopaholic,1,12-Apr-18,,This stuff is amazing  just AMAZING. Does not feel heavy or greasy on the skin. Is a nice light gel that makes your skin feel so supple in the morning. I would love to purchase their entire line  but it is a bit hefty on the price. Great addition to the skin care routine though.
8657,Ves9945,0,01-Jul-16,One person found this helpful,I received a sample of this product  I followed the instructions  and applied it before bed. It went on smooth and cool. When I woke up the next morning  not only did this stuff NOT hydrate my skin  I woke up with my face just RAW! My skin actually hurt. I ran to the mirror and my entire face was completely sucked dry of any moisture that might have existed before I used this product  AND I had crusty scabs on several areas of my face where this product pretty much burned my skin! My skin type is normal to dry and according to the label  this product is for  all skin types.  It took almost TWO WEEKS for the scabs to disappear and for my skin to return to normal. So...if you want your face to burn while you sleep and you d like to wake up raw and feel pain from the dry skin  definitely use this product!
8658,Shelby,1,11-Aug-16,One person found this helpful,Leaves skin hydrated through the night so you wake up feeling fresh! Highly recommend to anyone with oily skin like myself because of it being water based I don t notice any breakout like I do with creams.
8659,Jlrvs69,1,25-Mar-14,One person found this helpful,I am a  product junkie  - I try everything and anything within reason (have not done plastic surgery type things or paid for La Mer). But my friend visits Korea once a year for work and always brings us back cool skin care products. (we ve all been using BB Cream for over 5 years) Anyway  she brought us a sample of this and I love it! So I ordered a few from Amazon (Target also sells online). It s called a  mask  but you can apply it and it isn t very noticeable. It sort of leaves a light film on your face - nothing uncomfortable or annoying. Then you wash it off in the am. I ve been using for 3 weeks and my skin is noticeably softer and smoother. I wouldn t say it gets rid of wrinkles  but definitely reduces fine lines. My skin feels firmer  too. It is definitely worth the money (and is actually reasonably priced). I have fairly sensitive skin and did not have a reaction at all. Enjoy!
8660,Laura Holloway,1,02-Jan-16,One person found this helpful,This is one thing of the most incredible - if not THE most incredible - skincare products I have ever used. I began using this product this winter and immediately noticed dramatically increased hydration in my skin. It feels so good to go to sleep with this product on your face  and it smells delightful to boot. I highly  highly recommend if you re in search of moisture for your skin.
8661,S. vang,1,05-Feb-15,One person found this helpful,I have to say this is a great product. I just started using this and can see a huge difference in the morning. My skin is clearer  firmer  and we ll hydrated.... I will update as the weeks go by.  People complain about the floral snell but I have to say  I really like it. It reminds me of the Black Diary mask smell  just exactly like that.
8662,Lila N.,1,04-Oct-15,,I think that it did a great job at moisturizing my face. It made my face plump in the morning! I have normal skin. This did not break me out. Though I won t be repurchasing because I am not looking for more natural skincare lines  also it was a bit thick for me  I would be afraid to lay my face on the pillow since it is so sticky .
8663,Lwoods,1,26-Jan-15,30 people found this helpful,IN LOVE!!!!!!!!  Let me apologize now for this long review but I searched all the reviews for someone similar to my skin type and couldnt find information so I want to be very through for the next person. I am a 30yr old African- American  dark skinned woman  who has oily sensitive acne prone and yes sometimes even cystic acne. I am no stranger to blackheads  painful bumps that come out of nowhere. I have been fortunate enough to be able to afford some expensive products  facials  peels and everything under the sun to try to help heal and hydrate my skin. The list is obscene and embarrassing to be honest. But if you have suffered from  problematic skin  then you understand the struggle.I am however fortunate enough given my oily skin to not have to deal with signs of aging yet minus some eye cream that I started using once I got to law school and sleep was rare. With that being said. Let me discuss the product. So first  I searched amazon for something new for my face yet again because the last 2 000 products didnt work out. I decided to give this a try. Let me begin with the packaging because I know that is important to some people if that is not important to you skip down to the next paragraph. The jar was larger then I expected. The coloring is beautiful and pretty. Sidenote now that you can get it at Target it is nice to be able to read everything clearly as I could not always do when I ordered online from different vendors. The top came off easily and was sealed for sanitary reason which I loves. The product itself really is that light teal color but goes on clear and dewy slightly sticky. A little goes a long way. I try to put a little on my fingertips with the spatula given and add as needed so I dont overuse this amazing product.A note about my skin routine that has finally helped to clear up my crazy skin I put this on last before bed after I cleanse  tone  pimple cream  serums so that it helps those penetrate better and that works so much better. I notice on the nights that I use this they seem to penetrate my skin even more so as weird as it sounds when i use an overdrying spot treatment at night I add this on top even if just in that spot and my pimples seem to go away even faster. It seems to make the spot treatment even more effective. Now once I have applied a light layer to my face because I have oily skin I never want to over apply out of person fear. I have never actually over applied. Often I find that after about 30 seconds my skin has soaked the product up and then I reapply. I dont like other reviewers have to wait 5 minutes or any of that. But I also have to apply acne treatments to my oily skin so I think that may also effect my skin needed to soak up this moisture. After I have applied it to my whole face and it soaks it up when I reapply it is only in the areas that seem to have really just soaked it up super fast. Or if my skin is flaky which happens for me by the creases of my nose I will always adda second slightly thicker layer. Dont jut slap it on there apply a very light layer and reapply as needed. Once the product is on my face and looks dewy and the final layer is applied and soaked up after the 3-5 min which is what i wait for if my soaks it up any faster then I add alittle more. But you know your skin best worst case you apply one layer and use it again the next night if you want more hydration. Though it is recommended to use twice a week I use it as often as 4 times a week  on a plane and if I am in a dry climate or tanning a lot on the beach then I use it every night to keep my skin hydrated. Which I realized is HUGE for oily acne prone skin. Weird I know. Oh the scent is not strong to me I rather like it. It is a drastic difference from the other products I use because it smells nice not like medicine. It is lightly scented and my boyfriend loves when I wear it because he calls it perfume for my face. Not strong at all. I come from a family with a strong sense of smell and a lot of allergy suffers so I cant use everything sometimes or it might aggravate them and they love it and use it too. My mom is 60 and has very sensitive skin and is allergic to so many beauty products its crazy and this works for her skin too with no reaction! OK so  the next morning or if I am up all night doing work (another great time to use this product because your skin doesnt show that you have not slept) whenever I restart my day. I always look in the mirror to find supple  yes supple soft skin. Something I probably havent had since I was a baby. My skin is clearly plumper  more hydrated I have that soft glow. While I heard it is supposed to whiten I have not noticed that on my skin. I am the complexion of milk chocolate and I love to tan and get darker and it does not affect that at all. Actually helps when Im tanning as I previously stated. It does help with my hyperpigmentation and acne scars. They are not gone over night but after 2 weeks I notice them to less noticeable. It wasnt just me strangers complemented my skin which for someone who has cystic acne prone skin with scars all over that is huge to get a complement when wearing no makeup. So def helpful for my acne scars and I have used it on my arms where I have scars from keratosis and it helped those. I have used it on my boyfriend eczema and those scars and now I have to hid it from him sometimes because it did wonders for him. I was worried given my skin sensitivity and that my pores clearly are easily clogged given all the acne I deal with that this would clog my pores but I have to find any pores clogged in fact they seem small. I first had to get this product off an asian beauty product website that I could only use with google translator so I was thrilled when I found out it is now at Target for about $25. It is the same product  in English. Also for those of you who havent used it some Targets have testers too. Which is great if your unsure about the line. I have been using this for 6 months. And will continue to use it. I never thought Id have soft skin but this is amazing. Note: I do not use this to help with acne treatment as that is nothing I think that it can do. All my like for the many dermatologists who proscribed everything under the sun that never worked or made my skin or broke me out...etc And even all the Estheticians I have seen for the many facials  peels and microdermabrasions they all have said I needed to moisturize my skin. Which I scoofs at because DUH people I have oily skin but I was wrong. If you have oily skin some of the excess oil apparently is because your skin is over producing oil because it thinks it needs to and thus you are left with a slick face by 11am (my skin is very oily). While my oily skin is also genetic  from my dad  some of this extra oil was because I thought I didnt need to moisturize. I was wrong and this has helped me extremely in trying to clear up my skin. It is actually getting better and using this mask 4 times a week is a HUGE part of the reason why. While I have never used any other overnight sleeping packs I have used night creams and night time moisturizers (which are marketed differently) by chanel  clinique  kate sommerville  lush  to name a few and no other product has given the overnight results of this product. I recommend it to everyone of all ages. I love this product. I hope this helps I know this is long but i wanted to include everything I could think of for the new buyer. It has been a huge help to me and I wanted to share my experience with others as I am finally on the road to clearer skin and a clearer complexion.
8664,Emily,1,19-Mar-15,,Very good product for all skin types. I love the smell and the cool feeling it gives to my face as well. I used this as the last step for my facial routine. However  on summer time  weather is hot  you may have to reduce the amount of this product on your face to prevent overuse and skin oily.
8665,Club Racer,0,24-Aug-15,2 people found this helpful,First time using the products  and my skin broke out the next day. My normally oily skin was very dry for a few days and peeling.
8666,Amy,1,01-Jul-13,One person found this helpful,I ve always been fond of Korean products. It took me a long while to research this product and finally commit into buying. I have used this stuff w/ my other night time skin care regime and i love the way it makes my face feels in the morning. Its a sleep pack - so therefore you put it on right when you are about to sleep. let it absorb for a little bit  and go to sleep. Wake up the next day and wash it off. I ve noticed that my skin looks more healthy  hydrated and refreshed!.
8667,123,1,18-Sep-14,,I tried it several times  and it s very water like and moisturing. However  I don t like it that much is because it s heavy on my face and feel oily and I don t like the smell of it. I send it to my mom.
8668,Andrea,1,29-Apr-15,,I received a sample in a magazine and only used for two days  but I already see and feel a difference in my skin. It feels smooth slightly firmer and glowing. I am going to be purchasing this immediately.
8669,Ashley Reagan,1,06-Oct-14,,First off  my skin type: acne prone  sensitive  combination  and dehydrated.  Great sleeping pack  moisturizing and doesn t break me out.
8670,Wondering Heights,1,22-Jul-14,,I LOVE THIS CREAM! Works well with all types of skin  soaks right in. Great for morning and night  and doesn t clog my pores. I put serum on under it  and this over  followed by sunscreen and I m set.
8671,Evon,1,17-Mar-15,One person found this helpful,I am in my late 20 and have African American combinational skin. I wanted to start using a night cream that was more expensive yjan the generic brand I have been using but that wasn t in the upper $100 in price. My friend introduced me to the Korean skin care routine and Ive been hooked ever since.  This night cream is moisturizing without being greasy which is important to me cause I am prone to breakouts easily. I normally wash my face with oil cleansed and lathering face cleanser  then toner and the laneige sleeping pack. A little goes a long way  just a pea size and the dap a LITTLE organic coconut oil on top. I wake up the next day with beautiful relaxed radiant skin. Love it!
8672,NotFromKansasAnymore,1,01-Oct-14,,Love how this add extra moisture to the evening cream for combination/dry skin. My skin is baby soft in the morning.

8677,Angie,1,06-Jun-13,6 people found this helpful,This is a thick gel mask. Not sure why some reviewers complained about the scent. It s light and not offensive. I am the type that can t stand strong fragrance but I don t mind this scent at all.  The mask feels light and moisturizing  but the result doesn t last long. My skin is back to where it was the next day. Good for a quick pick me up treatment  but don t expect it to have long term effect.
8678,Amazon Customer,1,18-Sep-14,,Great product

8682,Anjalu,1,21-Mar-19,,I love it!
8683,Mel Q.,1,30-Mar-19,,I love their products. I actually use this twice a day and as a base under makeup. It is not oily and really helps to hydrate and plump the face. I was having issues with dry flaky skin and this helped me heal. I have used this for years. I have tried other products but always come back to this. It also curbs my breakouts since it is water based  not oil based. Highly recommended!

8692,Terrance Sterling,1,04-Jul-19,,Legit...one the the best moisturizers that I have ever used (and I have tried a lot of moisturizers). I’ve always heard really amazing things about Tatcha and decided to give this one a shot. I’m glad I did. Not only was the moisturizer amazing  they got me with the freaking packaging. I never like to dip my fingers into a product because your fingers are constantly touching things that are teeming with bacteria  then you stick your fingers into your moisturizer and you’ve contaminated the entire jar. So I always use spatchulas to get anything out of a jar. This one comes with its own adorable spatchula built in on the jar lid. Which is not only more hygienic but it helps control how much product you’re using each time. Love this brand and love this moisturizer!
8693,Amazon Customer,1,28-Apr-19,2 people found this helpful,Luxury item with unique feel to it. Pleasant subtle fragrance. This is expensive but a nice treat to use.

8697,jocelyn,1,28-Jun-19,,I’ve tried many moisturizers and NOTHING compares to this. I never thought I’d spent this much on a moisturizer but I’d say it’s worth every penny. It makes my skin feel so amazing and my skin texture has changed from using it. I use it before I put my makeup on and it makes such a dramatic difference. I’d highly recommend it

8707,Prisca Raymond,1,11-Feb-18,19 people found this helpful,The product is worth the money. I live in NY where the winter has been brutal  my face usually is always very dry.

8708,eleyne,1,12-Feb-18,11 people found this helpful,I have sensitive skin combination prone to breakouts and this moisturizer has been great - it feels surprisingly liquid when smoothing in  and absorbs quickly and evenly.
8709,Francisco Morales,1,26-Mar-19,4 people found this helpful,This product was my first from Tatcha....and I love it!!! The smell is amazing! Smells floral  but not that hyped flowery smell a lot of companies use. It s subtle. A little goes a long way. A dermatologist I follow  Dr. Dray  does not recommend it due to fragrance  and gold in the product. She states it has the potential to cause irritation. I still use it  and have not had any issues. What works for one person may not work for others. Get the trial size  enough for a couple of uses  and decide if you want to go for the full size one.
8710,Renaissance Girl,0,21-Apr-19,3 people found this helpful,I tried this on at Sephora and was given a sample to take home. When I first tried it  I flushed a bit  but as I was trying makeup too  I wasn’t sure if the moisturizer  primer or foundation was making me feel itchy afterwards. After cleaning my face  I decided to wear this overnight to test it. As I write this  my face is super itchy and hot. I’m going to have to wash it off  it is 2 am. Am I reacting to one of the botanicals? This is clearly not for people with sensitive skin/rosacea. IT’S VERY EXPENSIVE. BE SURE TO TRY BEFORE YOU BUY.
8711,Britney,0,12-Jan-19,5 people found this helpful,I wanted to like this product so badly. The first time I put it on my face felt amazing . 2 days later I got 3 deep cystic acne pimples. After a week they healed and my face cleared up so I tried again. The next day 2 deep cystic pimples and some more less severe acne on my forehead cheeks and chin . My sister tried it out too. She broke out with white heads as well the next day. Returning

8715,Customer,1,12-Jul-18,9 people found this helpful,Love this stuff! I ve been through two bottles of Belif aqua bomb  and was in the mood to branch out and try something new. I kept hearing good things about this product  and while it s a little pricey  I thought I would give it a shot. I have normal to dry skin and use a heavy night cream at night  and prefer something lighter during the day. I really like this stuff. While the texture is very similar  I think I like this stuff a bit better than aqua bomb. However this is also nearly twice as expensive. I don t think it is worth the price. Even aqua bomb is a bit up there in price for what it is. I ve not tried drugstore options yet  but I want to try some of the drugstore  water-based moisturizers  and see how they compare. This Tatcha water cream is my favorite so far  but I likely won t be re-purchasing simply because of how expensive it is. It s only minimally better  and not worth it considering how similar these types of moisturizers are.
8716,R Edmonds,1,08-May-18,7 people found this helpful,This stuff heals abrasions too! Not only is it a lovely  delicate  hydrating feeling cream but it healed by skins abrasions! In a day I saw healing happen. The only downfall is the price.

8723,Kevin,1,21-Oct-18,5 people found this helpful,I could never find the right product for my face until now. Other moisturizers are heavy and oily and make my pores feel like they’re clogged. Tatcha’s Water Cream  however  changed that for me. It’s weightless and I can apply it easily. Unlike other moisturizers  I don’t have to keep rubbing this in my face forever until it dries - this stuff absorbs into your skin quickly. It also leaves my skin silky smooth and I usually forget it’s there because it’s so weightless. Do yourself a favor - splurge on this item. It’s one of VERY few items that I’ll actually pay the ridiculous price to get!
8724,prisrob,1,25-May-19,One person found this helpful,Not fond of creams that just sit on my skin. Tatcha water moisturizer absorbs evenly. I use Morning and night.. Ii is very humid in my area in the summer  and thicker creams that don t absorb can tend to make my face feel sticky  I have no problems with this water cream. I find these products to be the best I have ever tried  and I Used many different creams. I have been looking for a lightweight moisturizer for summer  and 5his fits the bill in many ways. The packaging is very attractive. A light green jade jar with small holders in gold for the spoon on the top of the jar.  The formula contains wild rose  leopard lily  and HADASEI-3 Complex  a complex of green tea  mozuku algae  and rice. It leaves my skin feeling soft and radiant  and this imparts a subtle  shine-free glow.  I use this cream mornin* and night. I cleanse my face  and then scoop a small pearl size amount of cream with the included spoon  and massage it gently onto my face  neck  in upward strokes. My foundation seems to glide on  and it stays put during the day.  Recommended. prisrob 05-24-19

8726,Sierra K.,1,13-Jul-18,4 people found this helpful,I searched for awhile on amazon to find a substitute for my Dior skincare regimen as it was getting too expensive and I’d prefer not to go to the mall. I bought countless moisturizers that were all useless  heavy  and disgustingly greasy. I tried this Clinique and was pleasantly surprised. It leaves my cheeks softer than my Dior cream and I only use the size of a flat (not rounded) dime for my entire face and neck. It may be a small tube  but you use so little that it should last awhile. While it still costs more than I wanted to spend  it’s worth it. Between this  serums by Baebody  and various products from InstaNatural  I’m loving skincare again. I do still use my Dior pore minimizing pink masque when I can splurge though.

If you want this bottle  please save your money and buy directly from a Clinique counter somewhere.

8749,Jessica Marie,0,22-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,I was honesty expecting more from Clinic. With how expensive it is  I thought for sure this would be good for my oily skin. Nope! This stuff made me break out so bad! I broke out worse then I ever have. On top of that  I didn t even feel like it moisturized. My skin would still feel tight and dry. At first  I thought maybe it was just hormones or something. But every time I tried to use it  I broke out again.
8750,MoCuishle,1,14-May-18,,it was very suitable for oily skin. I love it.

8753,marumaru,1,15-Oct-17,,I naught this because it was recommend for oily to normal skin. I have a lot of issues with cystic acne  so I m very cautious of things that might clog or irritate my pores.  I really like this moisturizer  though! I don t need to use a lot (maybe a pea sized amount) and I can cover my whole face. It dries matte and doesn t leave my face feeling oily or sticky. Since incorporating this into my routine  my skin had been much happier with me.
8754,snigdha reddy,1,28-Mar-17,,it works
8755,K,0,23-Apr-17,,Despite being made for oily skin  my oily skin did not like this. The lotion wouldn t quite sink into my skin  and left a shine 5 minutes after application. It didn t feel as much as a gel  but I wouldn t have minded that if it meant that the gel was thicker. It was more thin  and didn t seem to make a difference in my oil production. Hopefully it makes a difference for someone else!
8756,Christie McCombs,1,20-Feb-11,5 people found this helpful,Words cannot describe this moisturizer but I will give it a shot anyway. It goes on creamy and cool. Once I get it rubbed in  my face feels luxorious and silky. When I put it on  after using my mild Clinique cleanser and toner at night  the silkiness lasts all night and into the morning when it s time to begin my morning regimine. This moisturizer even keeps a clean silky feeling underneath my makeup all day. I have oily skin and have never found a product like this that keeps me moisturized  yet clean feeling all day and night.

It’s so light and not greasy which is great for my oily skin. I also have sensitive skin and this doesn’t irritate it al all. I love Clinique products!
8759,Amanda,1,10-May-16,2 people found this helpful,Great moisturizer for people with oily skin and acne. Feels nice and light. I have been using it for years and ordered this for the good travel size - 50 ml so acceptable as a liquid/gel on an airplane and the shape fits easily in a quart size plastic bag.
8760,xraychica,1,09-Aug-17,One person found this helpful,I have insanely sensitive skin  and this is the only moisturizer I ve found to date that will not break my skin out. It feels so nice going on  absorbs easily and quickly  and a little bit goes a long way. This tiny little thing lasts forever.
8761,Doodlebug,1,27-Feb-17,,This GEL version is much lighter than the  new  original formula. Highly recommend trying this if you are disappointed in the original.  It works on my dry skin like the original used to work.

This size is for free from the company as a  sample  size when you buy other products from them. Rip off to pay this price. All in all  a bad experience.
8784,Debbie in Seattle,1,01-Sep-14,One person found this helpful,Have been a long time user of Estee Lauder products but seem to be pricing themselves out of my spending limits.

8789,maisy,0,17-Mar-10,7 people found this helpful,I just sit and chuckle when I read all these reviews for these high dollar products. Noxema for cleansing  witch hazel for toning and Pond s for moisturizing. I ve saved tons of money over the years by only buying 3 simple products. I m 63 and get comments almost every day regarding how youthful my complexion looks.
8790,Maria,1,18-Nov-18,146 people found this helpful,LOVE this stuff and I have for years  and I ll admit I m not a fan of most Garnier products. This moisturizer doesn t feel greasy in the least  yet it is immediately soothing and feels like your skin is drinking it in. You can wear it under makeup during the day  or at night. I can t say enough good things about this product. I m 43 and still get hormonal acne every month  and this product has never made it worse  and has actually helped clear it up when my skin  despite the pimples  has gotten too dry due to astringents and other facial cleansers for oily skin.  I m not a fake profile  nor have I been compensated for any reviews...in fact  the reason I take the time to review purchases when I can is due to the fact that I find other honest reviews helpful and am tired of all the fake reviews that have polluted this site. If you find my review helpful  please take the time to rate it as such  not because I ll get anything out of it but so that others can see true reviews. Thanks and Happy Shopping!
8791,Andrea Pruett,1,27-Jun-18,126 people found this helpful,OK  I be feelin  like a whole Amazonian forest after I use this product. It smells good and quenches my skin more than a bottle of gatorade does. It leaves me glowing to the gods and a highlight so poppin   James Charles in quaking. Boi I literally got this product only 15 minutes ago and I already feel like Jesus has blessed me. This product  a gift from the heavans  is really what I needed to be lookin  like a whole goddess. Good move Garnier  good move.
8792,puppycat,1,11-Nov-18,40 people found this helpful,Normally I am not one to repurchase the same product unless I truly don t think I can find anything better. Not with this moisturizer! I have tried both the dry skin (pink) and the normal/combo (green/blue) versions of this product and both are fantastic. It applies smoothly and a little goes a long way. I only need to dip my finger once in the product to cover my whole face. It takes away the tight  dry feeling after washing my face yet does not make my skin feel tacky or oily. Instead it makes my skin feel very soft. The screw on lid is also smooth and quick  an added touch. I love everything about this moisturizer. One jar lasted me an entire winter with semi-daily use. Will purchase again after this jar runs out.
8793,Alicia K,1,09-Oct-17,40 people found this helpful,This moisturizer works better than the $40+ gel moisturizers I got from Sephora. Really love it. I have oily/combo skin and gel formulas are usually not moisturizing enough for me since I use a lot of drying acne products. This is wonderful and keeps my skin hydrated without adding clogging cream ingredients. The only reason for 4 stars is because of the perfume. Holy crap  Garnier  this stuff is INTENSE. If you don t like floral scents or are sensitive to perfumes  you might try something else. It is overpowering and it gave me a headache the first time I used it. After awhile I got used to the smell  and I keep using it because it is a great moisturizer  but wow this needs about half the perfume.
8794,Amanda R.,1,30-Dec-16,42 people found this helpful,I used to use Clinique s Moisture Surge but found this when looking for a more affordable alternative. The formula feels almost identical but this is about 20% of the cost of the Clinique product. That makes this an excellent bargain in my book! I have fairly dry skin  and I ll put this on every night and also as needed during winter days if my skin is feeling particularly dry. It makes my skin feel instantly moist yet doesn t feel sticky or greasy. Love it!
8795,Melantha,1,27-Apr-18,15 people found this helpful,I m in my mid 30 s and have combination skin that is inching ever closer to resembling the desert  rosacea and a touch of eczema on my face. Dry with fine lines starting to creep in  I ve found this is not the best as my sole daily moisturizer. (I use the Garnier SkinActive  soothing version.) It would work well for someone who doesn t have all the same dry skin issues  maybe just one. It also does not help with the fine lines that are starting to show my enjoyment of life on the canvas of my face.  However  that was not unexpected. What I use this for is to refresh my skin the 3/4 of the year Midwest where it is either winter  or trying to decide if it s winter. I can put a thin layer of this on and my skin is moistured and has a dewy glow  without the extra oils that trigger my acne in the oily spots. (Side note: I do not wear primer  foundation  tinted moisturizer or powder.) I just put some in a small container and pop it in my bag to refresh my look on the go.
8796,YINyang1111,1,15-May-18,16 people found this helpful,I use the same moisturizer for my oily combo skin for over 10 years now and they no longer make it. so I had to find one that I could learn to love Just as much. I took a chance on this product based on reviews and I m so glad I did. Really impressed with how it goes on a skin and how well it hydrates and refreshes but doesn t leave any sticky were caked on feeling.
8797,Lu. G.,1,14-Oct-17,19 people found this helpful,I use this as a morning moisturizer and it s sensitive enough and light enough to use under makeup. It has a slight fragrant smell but does not bother my allergies/sinuses at all in the morning as I am rather sensitive to smells. I would recommend this product for the quality and price.
8798,Malinda ,1,22-May-18,8 people found this helpful,I ve been a loyal user of the Loreal Hydra Genius since it came out. I was just finishing a bitterly and read an article listing this as one of the top gel moisturizers and when I saw how cheap it was on here  I figured I d give it a try.....look out Loreal...I think you ve been replaced. I LOVE this moisturizer. Nice and lightweight  perfect for Warner months. I can instantly fell the difference in my fave as this sinks in. It leaves my skin so soft  smooth and hydrated that at no time during the day do I feel like my skin is drying out. I love the slight cooling feeling you get upon application and the fact this includes fruit extracts. I just wish it had an SPF factor. I will be buying again
8799,Chanel,1,09-May-18,9 people found this helpful,I have combo skin and I hate cream based lotions on my face. It makes my face feels greasy and horrible. But this is wonderful is just right. It makes my skin feel hydrated and fresh at the same time andddddd it doesn t leave my face oily not even towards the end of the day! Which is lovely.
8800,Rhonda Davies,1,05-May-19,4 people found this helpful,For years I struggled with mild adult acne and as a person over 40 I was irritated by the fact that I was still suffering from monthly acne outbreaks. I have combination skin with ranges from normal to oil slick. I started using this product along with the micellar water 3 months ago. I use it every night after I clean my face. I don t use it in the morning because it doesn t have an SPF  I use CeraVe Ultralight Moisturizing Lotion with spf 30 under my make up during the day. I have had the chance to use this product under my make up for evenings and it works well with my myriad of products and just absorbs into my skin easily leaving it feeling velvety and not coated like many other moisturizers. I would recommend this even if you re not ready to commit to a new moisturizer just find this product in the travel aisle and buy the trial size to see if it works got you. That s how I started because I was torn between this and Neutrogena s gel moisturizer. This product won and it s cheaper.
8801,Nana Says,1,29-Jun-16,12 people found this helpful,The name describes perfectly. This truly rescues the skin bringing back a soft  moisurized feel. I was so surprised by the texture I hesitated to apply as it looked like it might be sticky. I am glad to say that was not the case at all. It is a different texture  yes a gel  but it feels so good once applied and even better with a minute. A little goes a long way which is ggod because this is a small bottle.
8802,Sabrina s,1,08-Jul-17,6 people found this helpful,I normally don t leave long reviews but this stuff is amazing. I tried almost everything for my very very dry skin. My nose was cracked and each side of my mouth was red and patchy and it was starting spread due to the dry weather. I tried so many things and nothing worked or even came close to helping. So I decided to order different products on Amazon and gave this a try. The first few minutes all of my dry cracked skin was silky smooth and gone! I seriously love this stuff and it restores badly dry skin instantly. I would really recommend someone who has tried multiple products and hasn t tried this yet to give it a chance.
8803,L&J s Mommy,1,08-Nov-17,6 people found this helpful,I ve been using this moisturizer for several months now and it s been a great replacement to the much more expensive Clinique one I d been using. I have dry skin pretty much all throughout the year. I use this product day and night  before applying foundation or powder so and my skin looks and feels moisturized but not oily. It doesn t have much scent either which I like. Great alternative!!!
8804,Genesis,1,05-Sep-18,5 people found this helpful,I have been looking for this for awhile after getting a smaller version from a family member. I use this twice a day. I love the way it feels very refreshing. I ve had this product now for about 2-3weeks and my face feels way better. I will definitely buy more when i finish this one.
8805,SamSuM,0,22-Feb-18,6 people found this helpful,My skin usually likes Garnier products. This one really burnt my skin. My skin couldn’t tolerate it. I didn’t like the smell or the texture either. Smelled like medical alcohol to me and it was very light and sticky. Maybe it was a bad one but I won’t be reordering.
8806,Tamara Ramer,1,22-Feb-19,2 people found this helpful,I ve been using this for 3 weeks now and I can honestly say I m highly impressed. I have very dry skin and wearing makeup in the winter in PA is a nightmare for me. About a week into using this  my skin appeared softer and less dry. After three weeks in  it is super soft and smooth and there is barely any dryness throughout the entire day. My makeup finally looks good in the winter! I ve tried so many different products over the years and this has been the best so far. I even used Clinique s Moisture Surge  which is comparable to look and feel  but so expensive for a tiny amount of product  but didn t work as good as this did. I m a huge fan!
8807,Chris94,1,18-Apr-19,One person found this helpful,I’ve never used a facial moisturizer before  as I typically just use a men’s body and face lotion  but I’m not a big fan of all added perfumes/colognes. So far I’ve used this for about a week  twice a day and my face is so much smoother than it was before!  My brow would always be red from dryness that my lotion would never help  but this has gotten rid of the redness after the first day.  The texture is very nice and smooth. Perfect middle ground between watery and thick. It always goes on very easily and sinks into my skin and I don’t even feel it a few minutes after  just softness.  Only issue I’ve had with it was burning the first two days right after applying it. Burning lasted like 5 minutes and both cheeks were on fire and red. After continuous use the burning stopped however.
8808,K. Traxel,1,18-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I LOVE Garnier anti-aging and aging reversal products! This one is no exception! I have a tendency to frown if I am thinking hard and was getting lines on my forehead and one vertical one between my eyebrows. Now you can t see them unless I POINT THEM OUT! I m over 40 and get told I look UNDER 40 a LOT  and not until I started using this. I have recommended it to soooo many people! So this stuff REALLY works! I use it with a tiny bit of Garnier eye lifting cream and my laugh lines are MUCH less noticeable as well. This stuff is just my favorite EVER. No oil  it s a gel  so it just goes on and rubs right in! I have TERRIBLY sensitive skin and have to be careful what I use  and this is PERFECT. I couldn t be more pleased! I use the pink one for dry skin  but they have one that is green for  normal  skin too. Either way it is NOT oily since they are gel. I used it as a regular Garnier routine starting with their dry skin wash (Sulfate FREE since I am so sensitive)  and use this and a tiny dot of their eye lift cream on my laugh lines and upper eye. Garnier is THE BEST!
8809,Demetra Irene Weaver,1,25-Mar-19,2 people found this helpful,So  I was at first  a tad concerned how this would feel on my skin seeing it had a gel like look and feel. However  I was pleasantly surprised to find that within a few seconds of placing on my face  it was not sticky or gel like at all. Rather  it made my skin so smooth and soft. I do not feel that it leaves an oily after feel at all  just softness. Now  it may be my imagination  but I swear since I ve started using this (about 2-4 times a week)  I ve had less breakouts and clearer skin. Likewise  the smell is not overpowering  but there is a refreshing smell to it; very invigorating. I think the price is great for the quality of product  truly. I m 42 and have normal skin i.e not too dry or oily. Very happy with this product and will be purchasing again.
8810,Truth,1,08-Feb-14,9 people found this helpful,When I think of gel  I think of hair products! And since I ve never known gels to moisturize the skin  using this was even more alien to me!  But wow.. this has actually proven itself to pack quite the efficient punch! The gel is slightly opaque with a nice cool color of mint green. The gel feels as cool as it looks and isn t thick like a tub of hair gel  but it certainly isn t runny  though you may get some gel on the underside of the jar s lid if the jar is placed at an angle or upside down. The gel is also completely scentless!  Let me just say a little goes a LONG way. Usually when I put lotion on my face  I put a little dollop in my hand  rub my hands together to warm it up  and spread it onto my face. Because this gel requires so little to go a long way and absorbs quickly into your skin  I simply dot my face with the gel and that meager amount is enough for my face.  Within a minute  the gel is completely absorbed  readying my skin for some sunblock. Before I used to use Cetaphil moisturizing cream and as fantastic as that cream is  it s a little too thick and rich for my daily needs so I d have to wait a few minutes for it to fully absorb to put on makeup otherwise if I put on makeup with the lotion still sitting on my skin  it d LOOK like I have makeup on my skin. Cetaphil is great  but I think its richness is better for using at night.  I m very glad I bought this gel  it s perfect to use before a day out. My skin is in great condition thanks to my daily use of Vitamin C on my skin and thanks to abiding by the rules of The Japanese Skincare Revolution by Chizu Saeki so I m used to my skin looking a nice way and didn t think my skin could look any better.  Though my skin is firm and smooth with the use of my regular moisturizer  Cetaphil  I m surprised to see a difference with Garnier! The luminosity I ve gained from the use of Garnier is absolutely flattering. My skin looks so smooth and glows! All this time I thought the richer the better but this gel cream has taught me that less is more! It s so light yet my skin is quenched!
8811,Deborah Yang,1,01-Apr-14,9 people found this helpful,this is such a lightweight yet such a moisturizing moisturizer!!!!! I really recommend this to those who have oily and acne prone skin  this really moisturizes your face and keeps it dewy and healthy! In the wintertime I went up into the mountains for a retreat with my church and I brought this body shop face moisturizer/primer because I knew that it was going to be dry and my face would be horribly dry and flaky. The body shop moisturizer actually made things worse and dried out my skin  I would literally press my face against some dark colored cloth  and my skin would flake everywhere  it was disgusting and horrible and I just wanted to go home. The dryness caused me to break out 10x more than I would ( i have a big acne problem) I would exfoliate  but it d make things worse  because i had nothing to moisturize after with. I looked this up on amazon and saw the good reviews and decided to purchase it at a nearby target. Literally when I applied this  in one night my face was moisturized  not as flaky (it was still healing from when I came down from the mountains) and my face felt good and not dry and rough and nasty blegh. I m out of my first one from in December when I bought it  and now ordered and received my second one. I am sooo happy with this moisturizer  it s very light and smells nice and feels really cool and refreshing and its just all around amazing!! Definitely recommend for an inexpensive yet really good moisturizer. It s GEL not a CREAM so it s really good for oily and acne prone skin  cream can clog up pores and make acne worse. The only con..not really a con  is that it s surprisingly small ahaha i expected a bigger container  but it holds a lot and I use this on a daily basis morning  noon  night  whenever i wash my face! The container is made of thick glass  so try not to drop it! A definite recommend and definite buy!
8812,Courtney,1,26-Feb-19,One person found this helpful,So far  I ve really enjoyed this cream. It s light to the touch yet my skin always feels great after using it.  For those who do not like overwhelming smells from face cream or the fragrance in creams cause a reaction...this is NOT for you  This cream does have a smell to it. I m usually very against the smells of creams because I don t find them pleasant. But the smell of this is really nice. I enjoy it. It is a stronger smell than most other products I ve tried  so again  if that s something you are opposed to  then a different product would be better.
8813,Sarah R.,0,17-Dec-18,2 people found this helpful,This was cheap so I thought I d try it. Waste of money. Extremely heavy  artificial fragrance. Seems to sit on top of skin creating an oily sheen within a few hours. I have combination skin that gets pretty dry in the winter. I also use a retinol moisturizer every night and while it is much heavier  it actually soaks into my skin and leaves it soft. I was using this in the morning and it never soaked in.
8814,Tiffany,0,28-Mar-17,8 people found this helpful,I really wanted to love this but the smell is too strong. I have normal to sensitive skin and sometimes fragrance irritates my skin but this made me break out in hives.
8815,Mamta K,1,17-Oct-17,3 people found this helpful,I wanted a nonsticky formula for my face as I just hate the greasy after-feeling that remains forever when a cream is applied. This is light weight and I can see it getting absorbed in my skin almost immediately after application. This is just october and its working fine right now. However I will update when it gets much more colder in Boston. I want to see how it performs in extreme winter conditions. Hopefully this works Fingers crossed!!
8816,Amazon Customer,0,13-Apr-18,4 people found this helpful,I’ve been using this product for a few years and typically buy it at the store  but when it wasn’t available at the store anymore I decided to buy it on here. I don’t know what’s wrong with it  but it smells awful  like eggs  and is irritating my skin. I cannot get the smell out of my nose. I will not be using the rest of this product and I will not be ordering it from amazon again. This is the first thing I’ve ever ordered from amazon that hasn’t been good and it’s really disappointing.
8817,Torrie B,1,10-Apr-18,3 people found this helpful,I love this moisturizer! I have the driest skin in the winter and the oiliest skin in the summer. This helps aid and control the oil and I never have to worry about dry skin during the day. It literally lasts all day. Ive tried other products (some why more expensive) and this stands to all of those brands time and time again.
8818,DogoSora,1,18-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,This is my go to moisturizer for over 10 years. Yes  I have added somethings to my routine over the years  rose water toner  an eye serum and vitamin C serum but I still use this over the top of my night time routine. I have oily/combination skin that can be prone to breakouts but its not in any way due to this. I love the way that it soaks in instantly  can be used under makeup and leaves no sticky texture. Its refreshing in hot weather too and I will sometimes keep it in the fridge. My daughters now both use this as part of their skin care routine  since good skin care is best developed early. No one ever regretted taking care of their skin!
8819,AlyssaEcho,1,07-Feb-19,One person found this helpful,Was very nervous at first because I’m very picture with my face lotions and need face lotion after a shower because of how dry my face gets. My normal face lotion is very expensive  like 10x the price of this one. This stuff works almost just as great. It’s very thin and feels water based so it doesn’t leave a nasty film. Another concern was the strong smell it has like most acne products but unlike other acne products this didn’t irritate or dry out my face.
8820,Nikaboo,1,08-Jun-18,2 people found this helpful,I have never used a gel moisturizer before and did not want to spend over $10 on my first try. I was also looking to a cheaper alternative to my favorite oily skin moisturizer enzymion from Lush. This product was less than a quarter of the price of enzymion and it works great. It is a very light weight moisturizer that makes my skin feel slightly damp after the initial application but quickly absorbs to a non greasy  moisturized appearance. I initially used a very small amount to avoid having a super greasy face but that is not necessary with this product. It truly is a great moisturizer for oily skin that does not break the bank. Bonus: it smells great too!

Was looking for a good facial moisturizer but this isn t the place... Unfortunately... After cleansing skin and applying product (As Directed) my pores felt a burning irritation feeling so I Immediately washed the product off my face and applied the Queen Helen Cocoa Butter Lotion instead and my face felt Relieved...
8824,Sarah Muff,1,09-Apr-19,,Don t get me wrong  this product is DOPE. This is my second time buying it. It truly is perfect for combination skin. This product SAVED my skin during the brutal cold. My acne on my chin and cheeks slowly went away after using this product. I adore the gel consistency  because it isn t too heavy on my skin and it absorbs quickly. It s AWESOME under makeup. My only complaint is the bottle it comes in. I try to avoid moisturizers that come in jars  because I have to remember to wash my hands and put on germ-x before dipping my finger in the jar. I feel as if I m contaminating the product. It s silly  I know  but it would be 6/5 stars if it went from a jar to a pump-bottle.
8825,Michele Ford,1,29-Jun-19,,I have been going through chemo on and off for almost 3 years. I have noticed my skin has changed over those years and become very dry - especially on my face. There were areas on my cheeks  nose  chin and between my eyebrows that were especially dry and flaking. I have bought several different moisturizers ranging from $5 - $40 and nothing seemed to help. After just TWO applications of this product  I am already noticing a difference! I just looked in my magnifying mirror and the dry areas are definitely sucking in the moisture and the flaking is almost non-existent. I’m floored! I used it this morning on my stomach and legs which are also dry! Some people are commenting that there’s a  perfume  smell that is strong... I have not noticed that one tiny bit. There’s virtually no scent. I’m going to have to order more! ??
8826,Magdalene Luka,1,10-Aug-12,3 people found this helpful,I ve been using the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel for a little while  then I bought some of this to try. They re pretty similar  except I think this product is a little bit more moisturizing  not to mention much more budget-friendly. Like with most gel moisturizers  they re not meant for dry skin. This product I think could be used for oily  combination  or normal skin  especially if you re like me and lotions and creams on your face make you feel kind of gross. It doesn t clog my pores or feel greasy  and it moisturizes all day. It s only 1.7 oz  but it lasts a long time. You only need about a dime size amount for your whole face.  A few things to be aware of before you try it though: The packaging. I prefer products with pumps because they re more hygienic. This isn t that bad though. Just make sure your hands are clean before you dip your fingers into it and you ll be fine. The scent is fairly potent  but it doesn t linger or make you gag or anything. It smells a bit like cucumber perfume and it does have some denatured alcohol and parfum in it. It also doesn t have any SPF  so if you wear it during the day  you ll probably want to wear a foundation with SPF or a separate sun protection product.  Overall I think it s great  though  especially for the low price.
8827,Dusty Mcbunny,1,24-Aug-17,2 people found this helpful,I really like this stuff. A little goes a long way so that jar will last eons. It absorbs into your skin really quickly and doesn t leave any greasy feeling. It moisturizes well  and didn t bother my skin any. I had tried this one along with the Alba Botanica Hawaiian Oil Free moisturizer  and this one won out by far.
8828,Cheyenne,1,26-Oct-18,One person found this helpful,I love this moisturizer!!! I use to have oily skin and now all of a sudden I have really really dry skin and red blotches all over my face. I used this right when I got it and after washing it off I saw and felt the results immediately!!! This is super cheap compared to other product. Will be buying again
8829,Vincent Lee,1,21-Dec-18,,Love how light and yet effective this moisturizer feels on the skin. Being in a drier climate  this lotion is especially great to apply on the face on a cold winter morning before starting your day. The slight floral aroma does not linger and it gets absorb into the skin almost immediately upon application. I got my mom to start using it as well and she loves it!
8830,luv2shop,1,15-Jun-15,2 people found this helpful,I love this stuff. I have an allergy to almost everything made for your face even the most sensitive products are an issue. So couple that with combo skin and living in the desert where summer temps are 100+ and I had a tough time finding ANYTHING I could wear let alone something that worked. But this is perfect. It s light  non greasy  and moisturizing. Imagine a drug store product that actually works well. I even use it on areas that have been sunburned by accident and it helps tremendously. Also you don t have to use a lot so not only is it inexpensive and works but it lasts.
8831,Katee,1,03-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,After yrs of looking for a moisturizer that would hydrate my skin without breaking it out I found this stuff and it works great way better that clique and way cheaper too I am very impressed with this moisturizer :-)
8832,I’mJustBeingHonest,0,01-May-19,,I should ve known better. Buy a gel lotion and well  ya putting gel on your face! Lol! Sticky gel residue. Yuck. On top of that it made me break out in a rash. My fave was itchy  red and lumpy. Took 3 washes to get this junk off. My face was so tore up when I was done. Nope. The hunt for a descent facial lotion continues...Ugh!
8833,Savannah Hanson,1,21-Apr-19,,Wow. Wow wowowowowow. I absolutely LOVE this stuff. I put this on at night right before bed  and I wake up to beautifully moisturized skin. I can t believe I ve gone so long without it. It is easily one of the best moisturizers I ve ever had. It has such a refreshing cooling sensation that makes my face feel great. I seriously look forward to my nighttime skincare routine just for this. Would definitely recommend to ANYONE. Not oily or heavy at all.
8834,AbbiC,0,03-Jul-19,,loved the smell but left my face very greasy vs hydrated and as someone who doesnt have sensitive skin or typically gets any acne my face has broken out pretty bad since using it. tried to give a little time for my face to adjust but i would have more and more acne every day of use. stopped using and it all cleared up within two days.
8835,Morgan,0,22-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,I used to buy this years ago when it first came out and really liked it  so I thought I d change my routine up and give it another try. I don t know if they changed the formula or if it s just been so long since I ve used  regular  skin care products  but it actually made my skin drier and caused breakouts that took forever to heal. I ll be sticking with my face oils.
8836,Michelle,1,30-Oct-18,,I live in the Caribbean and have combination skin. This products works so well to hydrate my dry areas but not contribute to the oily aspects of my skin and I love that. It s a light weight formula that does what it says i.e smooths skin  clears complexion a bit (of course you need to manage your diet and drink lots of water also) but it helps. Love it!

My husband has even used it a few times on his super-dry sensitive skin and he loves it.

8841,Timothy,1,03-Aug-17,One person found this helpful,It s ok. Haven t really noticed a difference in my skin tone. It initially helped with oil control but not for long. The really great thing about this product is that it works well for sensitive skin. My skin is very sensitive and I break out with pretty much every other moisturizer but did not have any problems with this product.
8842,88/Rox,1,26-Jul-14,One person found this helpful,I bought a variety of  Garnier  products when I first began experimenting with facial products  and this gel is unique in their line! Oh I like most of the line well enough  but most seem variations of each other. (not to say that s a bad thing!) Anyway  this one is a light  fresh  somewhat tingly gel when first applied that absorbs quickly to a non-greasy  not too shiny finish. Some days I use only it  others I add it last to whatever else I ve applied beforehand  a flexible product in my view! Very attractive price when I bought it too  I try to always have a jar handy whether I m currently using it or not. I very unscientifically bounce between products  but I do like this one  more all the time!
8843,BK,1,28-Jun-19,One person found this helpful,This leaves my skin moisturized without making me oily & breaking me out. Seriously the best moisturizer I ve used besides First Aid Beauty  but this is way cheaper! I have also tried the pink  dry skin version  but that one totally makes me oily. I plan on using this stuff  til it s discontinued bc it s THAT good.
8844,Iyan,1,03-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,I have very dry and sensitive skin. This product moisturizes my skin a little bit  but its not enough. I would have to apply it multiple times  but I m okay with it. This is my 6th bottle by the way. I ve tried other products  but my skin reacts negatively to them. This one seems okay. It does have a chemical-like smell to it  but I guess I got used to it.
8845,Daniel Williams,1,09-Apr-17,4 people found this helpful,Garnier Moisture Rescue is a critical part of my everyday regimen. It s effortless hydration in a bottle that turns the dull/dry into smooth and radiant skin.
8846,Myra,1,09-May-19,,It s great for people who have oily skin/combo skin that is more on the oily side! It took me until about last year to realize that gel moisturizer is better for my skin type. Use this product in moderation though  since a small bit has a whole lot of coverage. The light scent doesn t bother me  and as soon as I use this product on my face  it feels refreshing.  --i use this product as a part of my morning routine after cleansing with my rice water foaming cleanser  toner  serum  and aloe gel
8847,lizlemon,1,13-Jun-19,,Have been struggling to find a moisturizer that doesn t feel like it s clogging my pores. This one is nice and light and absorbs quickly. Overall satisfied for the price  but feel like there could be something better out there that I just haven t found yet.
8848,lee,1,23-Dec-15,One person found this helpful,I love this cream. As the description states  it is a very light gel. My skin is very oily in places  but still gets dry in others. This product has just the right balance. It provides a nice fresh-feeling moisture to my face without turning me into a grease ball later in the day. I apply it just before my makeup and my foundation goes on flawlessly on top. As soon as you put it on  you can notice a difference in skin tone. Just gives that bright look  but without the oil. It has lasted a while too  compared to other creams that I ve bought. And it certainly comes at a great price. Give it a try.
8849,Suzanne C,1,17-Jul-16,One person found this helpful,I got a tiny bit of this from my mom to try  and got hooked! I had to order it! I will be getting more soon  as this jar is almost gone! I use it every day  2x a day on my face when I wake up and when I go to bed! So much less greasy than lotions  but keeps my skin just as soft! I love the gel/creme texture too! If you have normal/combo/oily skin  I totally suggest trying this as an alternative to face creams or lotions!
8850,Macy,1,31-May-19,,I love this moisturizer. I am huge on reading reviews before making purchases. Boy  were these reviews right! Your skin just sucks this stuff right up. It makes my face soft and feel hydrated after using it. I plan on making this my go to daily moisturizer!
8851,cakowalik,1,11-Apr-15,2 people found this helpful,I have oily  acne-prone skin that is also extremely sensitive. Recently  I had a reaction to a tinted sunscreen I tried  and my entire face was red  dry  and itchy. This was the only moisturizer that healed my skin and significantly reduced the redness after I applied it. I could literally see and feel my skin calming after using this gel. It seems unbelievable that a drugstore brand moisturizer could work so well  but it s soothing and softening without increasing oil. I use this morning and night and don t break out from it. I also add a bit of sunscreen to it in the morning to apply under my makeup. The jar is small and fragile  but a little goes a long way and it lasts for several months. I do occasionally need a dab of a stronger moisturizer if I have a dry spot in the winter  but overall  this is a great moisturizer for regular use. It reminds me of Mary Kay s soothing eye gel  as far as the consistency goes  and I don t find the smell overpowering at all. It s very light and refreshing.
8852,Amazon Customer,1,04-Jun-19,One person found this helpful,Very moisturizing! I glow!! I mix this with trueskin vitamin C serum and I love how my skin feels and looks!!
8853,LindsayRoseEliz,1,25-Oct-17,4 people found this helpful,I ve been using this moisturizer for years  on and off. I tend to repurchase it in the winter when my oily/combination skin gets dry  as my skin cannot tolerate heavy moisturizers. I find that it is slightly too moisturizing for me to use under my makeup  but I slather it on in the evening or when I m just around the house. I also use it as a refreshing eye cream that provides more moisture than my everyday moisturizer.  Recently  I have appreciated how this works in tandem with a low dose of tretinoin  which is a new anti-acne/finelines cream my dermatologist recommended. Tretinoin causes sensitivity and flaking  but the Garnier moisturizer makes an excellent companion to the cream. At first  when I was afraid of how the tretinoin would work with my skin  I applied moisturizer 30 minutes before applying the tretinoin to create a barrier. When I was sure my face wouldn t fall off  I started using tretinoin before bed (without any moisturizing barrier)  wash my face in the morning  and apply the Garnier moisturizer. It really helps calm my skin and moisturizes it enough to take away any flakes.
8854,Chel H,1,06-Mar-19,,Loved this for the price. The gel is refreshing and hydrating. I m in my late 20s and I have very dry skin that is semi prone to break outs and I did not break out with this product. It was great in morning and at night and also right out of shower to lock in some moisture. Jar is small though. Plan on buying again.
8855,ChalmondFashew,1,19-Feb-14,2 people found this helpful,I ve run across this moisturizer so many times  but never purchased it. Don t ask me why I didn t because the price is right and it has great ingredients  but I just wasn t sure if it was right for my oily  acne-prone skin. I get mostly hormonal acne  yet my skin is sensitive so I have to watch what I use. This has been really wonderful for me! A little goes a long way and it dries quickly. Yes it s a gel  but it s not too watery. It spreads easily and smells wonderful. I can t say enough great things about it! It doesn t irritate my skin or hormonal breakouts  and I ve actually been breaking out less since using it.
8856,Kay S.,1,19-Mar-19,,I really like how smooth my skin feels after using this moisturizer. It s very light and does not leave any residue whatsoever and only a few dabs are needed. It does seem to last throughout the day. I would have given 5 stars if the price was a bit lower.

I used to have problems with oily/flaky skin combination  other lotions I have used either didn’t help with the flakes  or made my skin super oily or both! This garnier face cream got rid of all the dry/ flaky spots without making my face any more oily than it is naturally. And I love the smell!
8858,Nic,1,23-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,Very light and so far giving my skin pretty good hydration without clogging my pours. But it smells like the shampoo does
8859,Jean A. Thomas,1,11-Oct-17,One person found this helpful,This facial moisturizer is wonderful! It s lightweight and absorbs quickly. Be careful  you only need a small amount. It feels so cooling on your skin. It doesn t cost a fortune  either  like so many of the other facial products. (It says hair color in their heading.. Maybe they ll take that off.)
8860,NecoShaeShae,1,14-Mar-14,2 people found this helpful,After cleansing and toning I make sure to use this. I then apply a cream facial mosturizer which seems to be the best combination to lock in moisture all day. I work in a plant where we work under industrial fans. The environment isnt really geared towards skin maintenance. When I dont use my garnier  my face always seems to feel a little dry after a few hours (even with a cream moisturizer). This helps my skin stay hydrated  and its oil free  doesnt make my makeup clumpy  and helps me maintain my glow. I was actually looking for another product that id used before by searching  gel moisturizer  when I found this. It wasnt what I was looking for but gave me the same effect  as far as I can see.

I tend to have very oily skin and my forehead looks shiny all the time. But this product has made such a huge difference my skin feels smoother and healthier. I try to stear away from non-man labeled products but this is as feminine as it is manly. Best part is that it makes shaving a whole lot easier no more knicks or cuts highly recommended!
8862,Amazon Customer,1,25-Apr-18,,This stuff is so freaking amazing. No smells  no sticky residue  no greasy feeling  and it keeps my skin moisturized all day and all night. Since I ve started using it I ve noticed my skin is wonderfully soft too. It s not really doing a lot to prevent breakouts  but it never promised it would. I use a benzoyl peroxide wash to combat oil  and then use this  and my skin is much less oily. Better than any lotion I ve ever tried if you tend towards oily skin. If you have dry skin  you re still in luck!
8863,Heather smith,1,05-Mar-19,,I never used to moisturize my face because I felt it led to breakouts. I found this for oily skin and it has been a game changer. I look forward to putting this on a night and in the morning  hasn t caused breakouts and it so refreshing.

8866,Mehgan,1,30-Aug-18,,I bought this after reading some positive reviews on a  Best Affordable Skin Products  list. I m generally very sensitive to scent  but this was not overwhelming. It absorbs quickly and I have noticed an improvement in the overall appearance and feel of my skin.
8867,Mr. Jeff,1,27-Jan-16,5 people found this helpful,Though  I like this product  I prefer the normal/combo skin version of this product instead. I find that the dry-skin version leaves my skin looking a little more shiny than it s counterpart. That being said  it s still a great  great product!  I d like to also note that this is no longer my primary moisturizer. I still keep it around  but I ve since switched to Sebamed Clear Face Care Gel. I switched because I wanted an unscented gel moisturizer.  If you ve never used a gel moisturizer before  give it a try. I was originally looking for a moisturizer that would leave my skin feeling hydrated without giving me that mirror-like grease sheen  or milky consistency  that I ve unfortunately grown so accustom to. I found it!  The pros: - My skin has a healthy glow  but without that shine! - Hydrates pretty well. - Doesn t make me break out. - Good price!  The cons: - Added fragrance. Though it smells good  I have sensitive skin and would prefer a version of this product that doesn t contain fragrance. - Face feels a bit sticky after applying. Fine for me  but might be an issue for people who want to apply makeup after.
8868,MLA-G,0,17-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,It s kind of all right if you need a very thin layer of surface moisture on your face. But it smells terrible like a mix of fragrance with heavy plastic.

Now the smell (my favorite) is great smells like cucumber melon  yall were right about the sunburn part i was actully burned the first week an this helped me tons. The only downfall for me would be if you apply too much it takes a good minute to dry so your there rubbing till it does but isnt that all moisturizers. Aside from that i d recommend
8873,Jannet,1,07-Dec-18,,Hydrates and feels fresh. Make sure not to put too much on  it becomes sticky and gross. A few dots is fine. It’s a fresh and light gel consistancy. It was nice  did it’s job  but wouldn’t be my first choice anymore.

I have mixed skin to oily  so I hate creams that are too think and heavy  I hate feeling greasy. But this is gel  so it leaves you with a very fresh feel and it smells really nice. I ve never had any allergic reactions  and I prefer this to the bioderm gel creams because it doesn t have so much alcohol like the bioderm.
8878,Heather,0,18-Feb-19,,I don t write very many reviews  but this has got to be the most worthless moisturizer I ve ever used. It feels great during application  I ll give it that. It feels light and cool  and it dries quickly. But my skin feels just as dry  and maybe even drier than before I applied it. It has zero moisturizing effect for me. I should have known the price meant it was too good to be true.
8879,iloveadeal,1,03-Oct-18,,Glad to have refound this product. its so refreshing to apply nightly and used with a bit of hyerlonic acid  you look really fresh and less wrinkled overnight. Smells fresh goes on softly .two for package here is a great value vs stores.

8881,Yelitza J,1,19-Jun-19,,When I say I love this moisturizer it s an understatement  I have purchased this twice and love it  Face is soft  visibly can see the difference once it s on your face and it soaks right into the skin. I am now gonna try the pink one see which one I like the most.

I ll keep looking but this didn t help my skin.

I ve tried the pink variety of this moisturizer when I can t find the green in stores  but it s just not the same quality (for me  at least)!
8885,kajynsaint,1,24-Sep-18,,The best light weight moisturizer! It s non greasy. I apply it over serums and other face products when used  and it still feels great. My skin doesn t feel heavy like it tends to do with other moisturizers.
8886,Captain,0,01-May-19,,I really hope I received a fake product because even applying the smallest amount of this to my face causes it to feel like it’s burning. I tried twice and the second time I had to wash it off because it wouldn’t stop  must be harsher than advertised. Be careful and test it out on a small patch on your face before putting it all over if you’re buying the product.

I forget I m wearing it. And it seems to last a long time  even for a small jar  because I don t need to use much of it.
8889,Adele Jackson,1,15-Mar-19,,This glides on smoothly and is not at all oily. It s extremely moisturizing and dried quickly. Good for day and night. Fixed my dry skin problem!
8890,frsnogirl421,1,08-Jul-18,,I was looking for an alternate for Clinique but this product does moisture skin well without alot of buildup... But the only thing I didn t like was the slight melon smell it had... Just personal preference
8891,Katelyn,1,21-Jun-19,One person found this helpful,The BEST moisturizer on the market  and under $10! All other moisturizers caused my skin to break out. I have dry to combo skin and get persistent acne on my cheeks and jaw line. This moisturizer has done wonders!!! Will never buy another kind.
8892,B Sledge,1,28-Nov-18,,For anyone with dry skin this is a great product. Love  love  love it! I use it everyday! I continue to use this product and so easy to get it sent to me by Amazon. I order two at a time.
8893,AYC23,1,03-Apr-17,5 people found this helpful,This is literally the BEST moisturizer ever for oily/combination skin. I love how refreshing the gel is and I love how it doesn t stay on the surface of your skin  your skin literally drinks this up! It has really amazing absorption and makes my skin feel soft and refreshed. It doesn t have any anti-wrinkle ingredients or SPF but it doesn t claim to either. This is a moisturizer  I use it after washing my face and toning it. It keeps the grease at bay most of the time and most importantly  it doesn t break me out like some cream moisturizers do. This stuff is the best and I will keep purchasing for as long as Garnier carries it without altering the formula.
8894,Marcia T.,1,04-Feb-17,One person found this helpful,Excellent moisturizer for the winter weather!! I could not find it @ CVS for sometime...So of course I shopped @ Amazon  and voila! It was much less expensive...Almost half the price you would find in stores. Whether you re wearing makeup or not  this Garnier product is perfect day or night to keep your skin feeling clean and fresh!!
8895,Stephanie Jones,1,25-Mar-19,,I like this product it is lightweight on the skin  and it doesn t create excessive shine on your face. I m a very satisfied customer and I would recommend it.
8896,Vanessa Michelle,1,03-Oct-18,,I do not like applying lotion on my face because it makes my face feel oily. this moisturizing cream is amazing and I love how quickly it dries and still makes my face feel soft and moisturized.
8897,Debra Wichmann,1,27-Jul-18,,I like this moisturizer. It feels so light and clean on my face. I also like the smell. I would say that during the winter though  when my skin gets exceptionally dry  I typically need a stronger moisturizer.
8898,Alexandria,1,22-Jun-19,,I like it because I can wear it under makeup. The formula is not greasy at all and it s perfect for my combination skin type.
8899,LLW,1,05-May-18,,After several weeks of use  little has changed. I have noticed I am not as blotchy looking though  but quality of skin is about the same. It does have a real nice cooling effect  so it is great to use after a face scrub
8900,Marcos n Devon,1,15-Jan-16,One person found this helpful,I have ordered this two times already. I really like how refreshing it feels on my face after a nice shower or getting ready in the morning. I use this during the day and another moisturizer at night. This is a great product and feels good. Has never caused me any irritation either. A new staple for my morning routine.
8901,Elaine Z,1,30-Sep-15,One person found this helpful,I absolutely love this face gel. I have tried other products  but they tend to leave my skin feeling heavy or greasy. Having had cmplexion problems in the past  I would not hestitate to suggest Moisture Rescue to all my friends and my family. The gel leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh as if I d put nothing on it after washing it  but yet does not dry it out.
8902,Kayla Johnson,1,24-Apr-19,,I love the feeling it left on my skin. It was cool  and soothing. Hopefully this helps with the peeling from sun tanning! If so  I am def purchasing this again. LOVE it.
8903,Selena Negrete,1,29-Dec-15,One person found this helpful,This moisturizer is a must have if you have sensitive  oily  and or dry skin. I bought this moisturizer because it was recommended due to my oily skin  and it worked amazing because my skin stayed normal and did not become oily like when using regular face cream. This gel based moisturizer is excellent and the price is perfect. It s on the small side  it looks like a normal sized egg. I would definitely recommend this product.
8904,Laura,1,17-Mar-18,,Great product! I have been using it morning and night for a few days now and I have noticed a difference! Not greasy  very light but moisturizes well and does not leave a film or sticky residue on my face or neck.
8905,Ellen Doyle,1,16-Aug-15,One person found this helpful,By far the best moisturizer I have used. First off this will not clog your pores. It also does not create a greasy layer but rather absorbs in and give a nice amount of moisture to the skin all day long. I love using it. After many years of fighting delicate  acne prone  rosacea skin it is nice to finally have something that doesn t aggrevate any of my conditions.
8906,88/Rox,1,17-Oct-14,,I keep a jar of the regular  Moisture Renew  (green gel) around as it does what it says and is so economical. Didn t know about this one until recently. I don t know about it having double the moisturizing of the other  but it s certainly as good for sure! Either works well for me  though neither is my primary moisturizer  but for one reason or another I ll use one of them  instead of   or  as well as ! The best non-sticky/non-greasy moisturizer I ve found for so little cost!
8907,AliCeeB,1,27-Apr-19,,It s a pleasure to leave my review. This face gel goes on without a greasy feel. It penetrates into my face quickly and feels light
8908,Amanda Scholes,1,16-Oct-18,,I wanted something that moisturized my skin without making it too oily. This product has been my skin s saving grace. Moisturizes without leaving skin oily.
8909,Kass,1,24-May-18,One person found this helpful,Amazing consistency that absorbes super quickly without any resedue. Just what I wanted
8910,Amazon Customer,1,20-Oct-18,,Really like this. I use the Clinique moisture surge on a regular basis but I tried this out to see if it would be a good dupe. Works really nicely! I’m impressed
8911,Tee Rimer,1,19-May-19,,Love this stuff. Lightweight protection without being tacky or sticky . Not oily more of an aloe texture I use daily
8912,David Lump,1,04-Sep-15,One person found this helpful,I have this set on subscribe and save because I just replenish when I run out. It feels cool on the skin and is light and moisturizing  yet not drying and doesn t make your skin feel greasy. It s also relatively inexpensive compared to some other moisturizers. It also smells great  which I can t always say about a lot of beauty products.
8913,TEN,1,11-Feb-19,,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER. ONE OF THE BEST. SOFTENS WRINKLES NOT STICKY KEEPS FACE SOFT ALL NIGHT AND DAY
8914,McSusie,1,03-Jan-19,,My favorite moisturizer & a fantastic add-on price from Amazon. Exactly like the much more expensive big name brand. You need to try this.
8915,Keisha Georgiou,1,23-May-19,,This is such a good cooling gel. I use it after I wash my face with harsh charcoal face washes that leave the burning sensation on my skin and this calms it right down. It’s also a perfect before bed moisturizer! I put it on before bed and wake up with smooth  moisturized skin! Definitely buying again
8916,Cynthia k,1,29-May-19,,This product probably works well for people with normally dry skin but not on  dry dry  skin. It’s very light weight and does the job if you aren’t looking for something permanent.
8917,Leslie,0,14-Jul-15,One person found this helpful,The gel formula is a little too thick for my liking  and it sat on the surface rather than being absorbed by the skin. I actually think that this product led to my face being more oily and acne prone than other cream moisturizers that I ve used  and I wasn t impressed with it at all. It did provide some hydration  but the feeling on my face throughout the day was pretty icky.
8918,Josh,1,23-Jun-19,,Great for everyday use  sunburnt skin  and keeping it fresh. Smack it on and let it dry cream pie!
8919,Nova,1,16-May-18,,I love this moisturizer! The gel formula leaves your face feeling sooo clean. I also use it on my lips if they are dry or cracking. Great price and a little goes ? long way !
8920,Jerrilynn Koltveit,1,12-Jul-18,,Phenomenal moisturizer. I generally have greasy skin and this product as well as the green bottle one keep my skin matte with a healthy glow. My acne has cut down and My skin is healthier and happier with the use of this product!
8921,Mangarr,1,07-Jun-16,2 people found this helpful,Feels weightless when on. Leaves no oily residue  but also moisturizes my face. My only wish is that it had some SPF in it  but it is a good product that does exactly what it says.
8922,noelle,1,05-Mar-19,,My face is incomplete without applying this stuff on my face to make it radiant and smooth. After just 2 days  people noticed how my face glows.
8923,Dr Aks,1,04-Jun-19,,I’ve been using it for a long time. Love it. Purchased it via amazon for the first time. Received it in the mail in perfect condition.
8924,Dreamer of dreams,1,04-May-19,,I usually use an aloe butter by itself but I find that this product then the aloe works even better. I m getting old but I don t want to look that way :)
8925,Kyle Z,0,06-Apr-18,,When I put this on after my morning shower  it stings like hell. Also  it s probably best for oily skin  since it doesn t seem to be much for ADDING moisture  mainly for CONTROLLING moisture.
8926,Leah En,1,21-Oct-18,,I love this moisturizer! I use it in the morning after I apply serum. I love that it’s not too thick yet provides moisture to my face.
8927,Demmy,1,23-Jan-19,,I believe I purchased this as an alternative to some expensive  hydro gel  from Ulta. I purchased this for $6.59  and I am happy with this product. When you first apply  you may look a bit on the  shiny  side  but overall this product leaves my face feeling moisturized and refreshed.
8928,Samantha,1,30-Jan-13,29 people found this helpful,I use it daily and it keeps my skin hydrated. It is a fantastic  simple product and I will continue to buy it. :) If I were to improve one thing  it would be to add SPF protection.
8929,Erica,1,14-Dec-18,,I love this product im almost out now so im sure i will be buying again. Only moisterizer that works before makeup!
8930,dsailer,1,14-Sep-15,One person found this helpful,I use this gel as a dupe for Clinique s moisture surge gel and it works great at a fraction of the price. I have very dry skin but it is prone to become oily around my nose and chin. This gel works great for my skin type and keeps my face from becoming dry and peeling while also not causing it to become oily.
8931,Leslie,0,16-Dec-14,3 people found this helpful,The first day I used this product my face felt amazing! But the next time I used it  my face started burning and became swollen with red sores all over it. Now my skin is so dry from the rash that it hurts to the touch and burns if I try to put anything on it to sooth it. I think I am allergic to something in the cream. I have a tendency to have reactions to things like this  so I can t say I m shocked. It did feel very nice the first use  so I do believe this moisturizer works for other people. But if anybody has very sensitive skin like me  I wouldn t recommend it.
8932,Amazon Customer,1,29-Jun-19,,Smell could be a tiny bit more fragrant but definitely moisturizing! Will purchase again.
8933,Amazon Customer,1,16-Mar-19,,Have been using this for a long time. It’s both cooling and moisturizing. Never irritating for my skin and not greasy feeling at all. I use it both as a day and night moisturizer. Amazon offers a good value so I’ll be reordering very soon.
8934,MImom,1,20-Nov-13,,This is by far my favorite face  lotion . Because really  it isn t a lotion. It feels almost like water when you re putting it on. No left over residue  just soft skin. If you have severe dry skin on your face  this probably isn t the best product. If your dry skin is mild  this does the trick. Plus  it smells good! My husband always says   you smell really good babe  right after I ve applied this stuff. Not after perfume spraying or showering. Go figure.
8935,Quietly Fierce,1,07-Apr-17,2 people found this helpful,I am as happy with this product as I was with my $50 jar of Clinique moisturizer. I love it  love it!! I am so happy to have found a less expensive option that doesn t feel like a compromise.
8936,Amazon Customer,1,06-Feb-19,,Love the way this feels. Great dupe for Clinique’s mositure surge. I definitely will be reordering.
8937,Stefanie Jennings,1,30-Jun-19,,This is amazing! My skin feels great. This is light enough to wear under make up
8938,Mandy,1,13-Apr-19,,Bought this in hopes that it would help with the dry skin on my face. This is great. I ve since bought more.
8939,Linda P,1,03-Feb-19,,I’ve tried dozens of facial moisturizers and this is my favorite. Cool and non greasy. Seems to create a glow
8940,Candice,0,22-Apr-19,,Don’t like the texture it leaves on face and hard to put makeup over !
8941,Ambar,1,06-Mar-19,,It is a really light weight cream  very refreshing and smells good. I use it on nights. Recommend it!
8942,Amazon Customer,1,16-Jun-19,,I really like the way this gel moisturizer feels on my face.
8943,Oohlala,1,14-Feb-18,,My skin was very dry this winter. I have combination skin. Not one of my old methods did the trick. This made my skin glass smooth & moisturized. I love it! Thanks Garnier!
8944,Chasity,1,21-Jan-19,,Works well but bottle is so to tiny that I started using a different product that lasts longer
8945,Megan,1,25-May-19,,I really liked this product  it’s been pretty moisturizing and also hasn’t made my skin breakout which is a huge plus!
8946,xcuzm3,1,23-Dec-14,,I originally purchased this to tie me over while my Biotherm Aquapower was shipped to me. However  I prefer the scent of this and it has been just as moisturizing. Add to it the price point of this gel-cream  and I have switched over to this product completely. I buy 3-4 jars at a time and don t mind lathering it on as it s only $6-7 for an entire jar versus the $30+ I paid for the Biotherm.
8947,Frida,1,07-Jan-19,,Love this moisturizer. I wash my face with neutrogena face bar soap and put this afterwards. It leaves my face incredibly soft and smells really good too.
8948,Cris F.,1,18-Mar-19,,You might need to apply more product than usual but that depends on what each one likes. It s not greasy and feels refreshing on the skin. Put on it on the fridge and it s amazing on hot/humid weathers. 100% recommend!
8949,carol,1,18-Dec-17,,This feels so nice on your skin  I use it with my moisturizer because I have very dry skin  and my skin feels great all day. I will continue to repurchase this skin cream.
8950,Mary,1,24-Jun-18,,I bought this 2x now and love it. Doesn t make me breakout and helps my dry skin retain moisture. I wear it going to bed.
8951,Prime Member Review,1,12-May-18,,What I love about this cream is that this is so light. Easy to apply. Water washable. And most important it is instantly absorbed by the skin.
8952,bonnie,1,28-Apr-19,,I Love this! Goes on smoothly and keeps my face moisturized
8953,Mile,1,21-Jan-19,,Excelente e hidrata muy bien. Pero al no tenerla en la piel se deshidrata nuevamente.
8954,Genna Bingenheimer,1,02-Jul-19,,Nice feeling on the face. No harsh fragrance.
8955,Stephanie Forrester,0,28-Mar-19,,Did not moisturize my face at all. Waste of money
8956,Unreal,1,27-Feb-18,,Super smooth to put on  been using for a few weeks and can tell a noticeable difference in my skin! I have super dry skin naturally so I need a really good moisturizer and so far this is good!
8957,M,1,20-Oct-17,,Fantastic in the spring/summer months when skin can be oily or sweaty/sticky - not quite moisturizing enough in the harsh dry winter months. Good price and smells really nice as well!
8958,Grrrrrrll,1,11-Jan-15,,I love this moisturizer  it is very light and I can wear it under makeup. It feels cool and refreshing and doesn t make me break out. This is definitely more of a day time product. Even with oily skin  you still need to keep your skin well moisturized so I use the one for dry skin at night. I m glad I can get this on Amazon  my local pharmacy only sometimes carries this
8959,Amber Ford,1,21-Jun-16,,I used this moisturizer before and stopped when my local store stopped selling it. I received many compliments on my skin. I had never gotten compliments on my skin. Some products feel heavy and felt oily. This moisturizer feels light and soothing. I will purchase the again
8960,Amazon Customer,0,17-May-19,,Meh  I’m in Tucson  maybe it’s just not something that works in this heat?????♀?
8961,Amazon Customer,0,01-Jun-19,,My skin broke out and became very dry. Also has a strong alcohol smell.
8962,Dot,1,02-Aug-18,,Been using this moisturizer for about a year. Please that it does not make me feel greasy  goes on wet but dries immediately.
8963,Sonya,1,30-Mar-17,One person found this helpful,Ive used about half the bottle now. I bought this because my skin got very dry this winter. I usually just use pure aloe. So it is a little oily but it really helped my dryness so i use it on my whole face at night and just my dry areas in the morning.
8964,Amazon Customer,0,12-Feb-18,One person found this helpful,The price is good and the product smells nice. It isn’t a good moisturizer for me and I have normal to dry skin. It didn’t leave my face feeling soft at all.
8965,Jennifer C. Rios,1,16-Apr-19,,Feels wonderful going on and great moisturizer
8966,Moyar,1,05-Jun-19,,I have combination skin where I m mostly prone to oily skin  but my nose and cheeks are dry and this was really helpful. It s very lightweight especially under makeup and I don t feel sticky or super dry with it on.
8967,Roman Grigorenko,1,09-Jul-18,,LOVE THIS. Its a gel-ish consistency but its soo hydrating and feels sooo smooth. Doesnt leave a greasy film
8968,rlw,0,06-Apr-19,,I do not like the way this smells at all. The moisturizer is lightweight and not oily but it doesn t seem to do much. I will not be buying this again.
8969,Jane,0,23-Mar-17,One person found this helpful,Just a messy gel that dries slowly and I don t feel any better after using product for a couple of weeks. SORRY cause I usually love their products.
8970,QueenofGnomes,0,27-Nov-17,,This took a long time to absorb into my skin and I didn t notice it moisturizing my skin any better than the Garnier cream moisturizer I usually use.
8971,Danied,1,24-Aug-15,2 people found this helpful,This is the best facial moisturizer I have ever used! My skin never have dry spots anymore. I use it twice each day - at night after using my clarisonic and in the morning before applying makeup. It dries quickly and does not leave a sticky feeling.
8972,Rhi,1,21-Oct-16,,LOVE LOVE LOVE this moisturizer! I use it every day in the morning before my primer and makeup. It is light and not greasy but really does its job. I have dry/oily skin and this moisturizes the dryness away lasting all day without adding to the greasiness of my skin.
8973,Amanda,1,03-May-19,,I love this product! I have only been using it for a few days and I m already in love! My skin gets really dry  like really really dry! I have a spot right on my forehead that I couldn t get to clear up for the last couple of months. Using this product for only 3 days and the dry spot is cleared up!
8974,Snowflake,1,20-May-19,,Feels good on my skin and smells nice.
8975,Hannah Stoner,1,24-Jul-18,,I love this product and this is a great deal! This is a light gel that really penetrates your skin and leaves it so smooth. I have sensitive acne prone skin that can not handle any topicals and this is a miracle for my skin! I would highly recommend!
8976,Iliana Gonzalez,1,05-Apr-18,,Super hydrating love it will purchase again! My face seems to get a little dry. I apply in the morning before my makeup I love how my skin absorbs it super fast and I love how it leaves my skin nice and soft. I have tried other products and they seem to leave my skin oily and shiny. I also love how my face feels after I exfoliate and apply this product. Love this product I recommend it!
8977,Karin Frohlich,1,10-Mar-19,,An excellent moisturizer for the face and neck. The gel refreshes the skin upon application and is quickly absorbed leaving one s face feeling refreshed and supple. With Garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue Face Moisturizer my face looked radiant and more youthful. The price is right too!!
8978,Ellie M,1,01-Nov-18,,really love this stuff! i recently moved to a hot and humid climate and my l’oreal age perfect moisturizer didn’t mix well with an everyday 90% humidity. this absorbs extremely fast  doesn’t feel sticky  and just feels over all refreshing. a little goes a long way but you get more bang for your buck that way.
8979,Amazon Customer,0,17-Feb-19,,This product dried my skin out. It smells like there’s alcohol in it.
8980,Mez,1,05-Apr-15,,A really good moisturizer. Don t let the amount of it fool you  you can easy just dab a fingertip of this stuff to your entire face and it ll work very well. It definitely makes my face feel fresh and smooth after applying it and the problems with skin moisture just go away after putting this on  especially after a shave or a scrub. I honestly have zero complaints about this product.
8981,Amazon Customer,1,28-Jun-19,,Love this. Smells good. Feels great
8982,klee,1,09-Oct-15,,I ve been using this moisturizer for at least a year and I love it. I originally decided to purchase this particular moisturizer after reading reviews on various gel creams; the main issue I have with traditional cream based moisturizers that I ve used in the past is the sticky/tacky feeling they leave on my skin. I don t mind it so much in a night cream  as they tend to be thicker anyway  but I just can t stand it in a daytime moisturizer. I have normal to dry skin and the Garnier Moisture Rescue works great for me  it absorbs right away and leaves my skin feeling so soft and not at all sticky! Also  it s a great value for your money as you only need to use a small amount per use (it takes me about 4 months to use up one jar).
8983,Nancy Walker-Pirner,1,24-Apr-18,,WOW super good I have been looking for a good moisturizer now I have will be buying again Highly recommend great product!
8984,America,1,22-Jun-19,,Love them I always buy them
8985,De Bajan Girl,1,25-Apr-18,,Very good product  especially for oily skin. Makes your skin feel very hydrated with no stickiness... I love it
8986,Brent Farris,1,12-May-15,,One of my favorite products by far. I hate how most face moisturizers make your face feel oily or caked on. This dries super fast  feels so light and after it s dry you forget you put anything on. Also  my face is SUPER sensitive but I had no breakouts  redness or itchy feelings with this. LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.
8987,Carmen M.,1,29-Nov-18,,It s a very great product
8988,Rowan,1,09-Mar-19,,Very light on the skin. Not a high moisturiser.
8989,Kindle Customer,1,08-Jun-19,,my favorite moisturizer! A little will go a long way and your skin really soaks it up - totally not greasy AT ALL!
8990,Randolph Ensign Jr,1,08-Oct-18,,I have used this for a long time  perfect skin moisturizer with no sticky residue.

8992,Linda L.,0,09-Nov-18,,At first but shortly after application  my skin is dry.
8993,Panicdanic,1,24-Mar-19,,Love this. It is refreshing.
8994,L. Wilson,1,29-Apr-14,One person found this helpful,Tried this because it caught my eye when buying Garnier Ultra-Lift Anti-Wrinkle Firming Night Cream. This is also nice. The consistency is lighter and there is a slight tackiness as if soaks into your skin. It is a good product  but I am already spoiled by the other more intense moisturizing effect of the Ultra-Life.
8995,Drew,1,16-Apr-19,,I love this product so much I have it on subscription delivery with Amazon. It works quickly to hydrate skin and there is a noticeable change in the overall appearance and glow after after using for several months. I hope they never stop making this!
8996,ADMPmommy,1,18-Mar-18,,Very moisturizing! Glides on really smooth and just melts into your skin. I do like it but not enough that i would repurchase again.
8997,Emily,1,26-Sep-18,,Best moisturizer I ve ever tried. A little goes a long way and this container is going to last me awhile. It sinks right into my skin as if it was meant to be there. Love it.
8998,Chelsea,0,28-May-18,,This product stinks so bad I almost threw up using it. I ended up giving it to someone else to use because I could not handle the smell

9004,raiv_53,1,08-Aug-16,,I need a moisturizer But the cream based ones are too heavy for my face So I went water based! I haven t yet found a product that matches or replaces this in my book I am subscribed for recurrent deliveries!

9006,brian C,1,08-Jul-18,,Has always worked well for my dry skin and redness relief.
9007,Wan,1,14-Sep-18,,Repurchase it multiple times. Like the gel formation and good light scent.
9008,Erin100,1,11-Feb-14,,Cool and refreshing. There are no ingredients on the  acne ingredients to avoid list  which is the reason I purchased. It seems to hydrate my skin and makeup glides right over. I also have the pink version for dry skin. I save the green for summer. I enjoy both. These arrived in the original box and were sealed. That is of most importance to me
9009,Virginia,0,25-Nov-18,,I bought this as an alternative to what I have been usually buying. This did not work for my skin. It made it dry and I ended up breaking out really bad. But I think if you want to try something it’s worth the try  especially for the price. However  it did not work for me.
9010,Amazon Customer,1,20-Mar-19,,I like it worth the price
9011,Kimberly,1,30-Apr-19,,Very moisturizing
9012,Jess Young,1,07-Mar-19,,Great hydration for a great price
9013,Ward,1,29-May-18,,Great Item! Shipped fast and arrived fast! Exactly what I wanted!! I dont use anything on my face but soap and water  but this makes my skin look amazing!
9014,melody peppers,1,01-Apr-19,,This is a great product but I would suggest getting it from bullseye for a bit less. Also if you live in desert climate like I do  you may have to seal it afterwards w/something like a touch of Vitamin E oil.
9015,ambergirl,1,19-Jan-17,,I have very sensitive skin and this is my favorite face lotion. Living in Minnesota my skin gets so dry in the winter and this really helps keep it hydrated.
9016,Julie F,1,15-Jul-13,,My skin is oily/semi-acne prone. I normally use the LaRoche-Posey Effaclar product line. I purchased the Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream to use at night. I am pleased with the product!  It has the consistency of aloe vera gel. It is light-weight and doesn t cause breakouts. I give the moisturizer a medium score because it sits on top of the skin; doesn t last long.
9017,Kindle Mom,1,13-Apr-16,,I love this gel moisturizer  but can never find the one for dry skin (mature skin) at the store. Always available at Amazon and the price is better as well.  I have sensitive but dry skin and this just sinks right in and doesn t cause me to break out. Super moisturizing without feeling heavy or greasy.
9018,Anita Standley,1,03-Feb-19,,It feels very soothing on the face especially after long exposure to elements. Also the smell is great!
9019,Tom D.,1,14-Jun-18,,This is a great product that I use without telling my fiance. A little goes a long way.
9020,S,1,26-Feb-19,,Very nice to moisten face
9021,Deni,1,14-Dec-18,,Great product it helps my skin so much
9022,Judy Kim,1,02-Jul-15,,I m not used to using gel moisturizers but from what I ve experienced so far is that this product is fast drying (which I like) but not all that moisturizing like I expected. That may be because my skin has been extra dry though so take that into consideration.
9023,A Concerned User,1,05-Apr-18,,Love this stuff. Cooling  refreshing  light. Moisturizes well and doesn’t clog pores!!
9024,Emily C,1,07-Aug-18,,Smells good and seems to be working. I have sensitive skin and has not made me breakout
9025,Hannah,1,04-May-17,4 people found this helpful,I live in a 0% humidity climate  so naturally my skin is somewhat dry. The problem was that if I treated it like dry skin  I got super oily and was actually starting to have more breakouts/icky skin. I decided to try something a little lighter  see if maybe that would help. Boy did it! This is a great consistency  and it soaks into the skin beautifully. Since I stopped using heavier creams and started using this  my skin has cleared up and is actually less oily/dry and has evened out. Love!
9026,Snow,0,05-Jul-17,,I m not a sensitive skin and so far this product is the only product that makes my face uncomfortable. It feels like burning my face. Not recommended
9027,joshua,1,23-Dec-18,,Keeps my girlfriends skin ultra MOIST
9028,Jake,1,13-Jun-19,,I love this stuff. I have oily skin so i tried this moisturizer and I’m so glad I did. Highly recommended
9029,Kaitlyn Bishop,1,31-Aug-18,,It smells really fresh and definitely moisturizes your skin. My only dislike is that it says all skin types. I have sensitive skin and after only 2 uses  I started breaking out in an area where I NEVER get pimples.
9030,Hubish,0,08-Mar-14,,I bought this for the great reviews and the first time I thought it was refreshing to try compared to other facial products. Now that I tried it for a second time  it s very drying (especially right after shower when I like to put my lotions on) and gets very tight on my skin. I don t like the hassle of return. So I guess It will just go to garbage
9031,Amazon Customer,1,24-Dec-18,,Good moisturizer but not the best option for super dry skin
9032,Jaya,1,29-Oct-17,,The product has a nice smell to it. It’s very light  can be a little sticky but a little really does go a very long way with this face moisturizer I use this in combination with my Thayer witch hazel toner and mario badescu facial spray and my acne has really cleared up. This leaves my face feeling more refreshed
9033,Courtney Brown,1,10-Apr-19,,I really like this moisturizer. It is super hydrating and does not leave your skin feeling sticky or greasy. The hydraulic acid plumps your skin minimizing fine lines. It is super inexpensive and of exceptional quality.
9034,XYZ,1,04-Apr-18,,Love it. Makes my dry skin soft and supple. Not greasy and doesn t make you break out.
9035,tnielsen2010,1,19-Jun-19,,I don’t normally write reviews but this stuff is amazing! I have very dry skin so my face is no exception. I noticed a big difference from the first time I used it. My face has never looked or felt good! It looks so much more healthier than before!
9036,TN Lee,1,19-Dec-17,,I love that I can slather this all over my face & not have to worry about it burning if it gets in my eyes.
9037,Natasha,1,13-May-11,,The gel is so soft and makes my skin feel like velvet! It doesn t leave any residue and a little bit goes a long way! I use mine every day  twice a day and it s still almost full (I ve owned this for about a month). I don t break out from it and it really works well under makeup (I recommend letting it dry before putting makeup on though). The seller packaged it well and I recieved it the first day it was expected to come. Very happy with both product and seller :]
9038,Torrie B,1,20-Apr-14,One person found this helpful,my previous moisturizers would leave a dry residue feeling on my face all day and since this one is a gell  it s actually pretty perfect. And the best part about it ... its travel size!  I just wish it had some sunscreen in it or some sort of SP-F that would be an added bonus
9039,N. Jordan,1,29-May-19,,This gel moisturizer does pretty well on my skin. My only problem is that the fragrance is odd... I swear it almost has a faint bus exhaust scent. It s weird.
9040,Susan H,1,07-May-14,,I m trying to buy more cruelty free items  and some how I mistakenly thought this item/brand was. But it is a decent cream  I use it at night  it s pretty hydrating and comfortable. I like the feel of the gel  very cooling  but doesn t dry sticky as some gels do. I have sensitive skin and this doesn t bother me at all.
9041,ALB,1,30-Nov-17,,This stuff is so Great!! Keeps oil at bay and makeup go on smooth. No breakouts from product either!!
9042,XYZ,1,04-Apr-18,,I use this during the daytime and it gives my skin just the moisture it needs.
9043,Nyah,1,23-Apr-19,,I love water based gel moisturizers the best. I love this because it’s super light yet still keeps my skin moisturized.
9044,Renee,1,20-Sep-18,,My faces feels so hydrated and non greasy
9045,Elizabeth,1,03-Jul-18,,This keeps my skin hydrated and cool all night! I’ve been using this for one week and noticed my skin looking better. It isn’t dry and dull like before. This product also absorbs great into your skin.
9046,Gavin,1,31-May-16,One person found this helpful,It s a very nice product with a pleasant smell. Moisturizes well and it s a pretty good product for use as a primer before putting on your foundation.
9047,David H.,1,03-Nov-15,,My sister introduced me to this. I m I m glad she did. This is a very light and simple hydration for your skin. Doesn t seem to interfere with any other product I m using. Just adds a little kick of moisture.  Who couldn t use that ?
9048,Ashley,1,02-Jan-19,,Works great!
9049,Theresa,1,16-Apr-14,One person found this helpful,I am very pleased with this product. It works great. After I went through cancer treatments my skin was in poor shape. My cheeks were dry and very red. After trying several different moisturizers   this was the only one that restored my skin and made it soft again. I use this twice a day.
9050,MaxwellTheCat,1,17-Jul-14,,The best. Perfect for people who tend to break out with oily products. I started using gel from Germany  and my brother would bring it over to me whenever he visited  but I could never find any here in the states. This is the first product I ve found that rivals the great moisturizing gels I ve found in other countries. YAY!
9051,Erika V.,1,24-Apr-19,,Love this gel because it does not cause me breakouts at all and it is a good hydrator.
9052,alexis,1,10-Jul-18,,This stuff is a great price and works really well. It makes my skin look so nice!
9053,WizzyRose,0,17-Feb-18,One person found this helpful,I bought this because I read it was a dupe for Clinique Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief. Nope  nope  nope. First of all  it smells awful. It smells like plastic and rubbing alcohol. It feels thinner than the Clinique. More lotion-y and less gel-like. It went on okay. But it never really dried down and absorbed into my skin! It just stayed tacky feeling. When I washed my hands it was like I couldn’t get this rubbery residue off. I put it on at night and when I washed my face in the morning  it was like I was washing glue off my face. I could still feel it sticky on my skin. I have never had a moisturizer (even low end) do that.  To add insult to injury  I accidentally ordered TWO of these tragic moisturizers. I can’t return the unopened one supposedly because it’s in a glass jar. I’m letting my husband use these up because he can’t tell the difference. And I just ordered myself a huge jar of the Clinique moisturizer. Just spend the extra money on something that actually feels nice on your face and works!
9054,H. D. Efua Dubie,1,09-Dec-18,,Completely non greasy plumping moisturizer. Great for sweaty summer months or light moisture in winter. Obviously not enough for really dry skin  but great as a light daily water based plumping lotion.
9055,momofboys,1,11-Apr-14,,Lots of moisturizing products make me break out or itch. I can use this liberally and my face feels instantly fresh! There is no waiting necessary. You can instantly apply your makeup after and it is 0% oily. I LOVE this product. I typically can not sleep in other moisturizers without waking up with little white heads (gross) and I can apply this morning and night after i wash my face. Even my toddler uses it in the winter on his little cheeks.
9056,Brandy,1,09-Sep-17,,This stuff smells great. I love using it. My daughter loved the fragrance and wants some too. Smells fresh and clean not like a perfumy old lady cream. The texture is sorta like a aloe gel but is more creamy and less cold than aloe gel.
9057,Amazon Customer,1,10-Nov-18,,Good skincare products!
9058,Tiffany,1,16-May-19,,I have always had dry skin for the longest time. Especially my face and this was really helpful. It really does moisturize the skin. Definitely worth my money and I would buy it again!
9059,Erin100,1,03-Feb-14,One person found this helpful,I love this moisturizer and hope it never discontinues. It has non of the  acne ingredients to avoid  and it great for my troubled skin. Cool  refreshing and lightweight. Works well under makeup or alone. Fast shipping and came in original box. All was sealed for safety
9060,Kristina,1,24-Mar-18,,This has become my new favorite moisturizer! Smells amazing. It’s not greasy like some are. It leaves my face feeling refreshed. Will definitely buy this again.
9061,Mookie,1,04-Sep-18,,Not greasy smells good
9062,macy,1,06-Aug-15,,Love this stuff as a moisturizer. It feels so light on my skin and doesn t clog my pores at all. I have oily skin so I especially love this for summer because it s a gel so it feels much lighter  it absorbs faster than a lotion  and it smells great.
9063,Allisson Lozano,1,21-Apr-19,,Me encanta ya es la segunda vez que la pido tieneun tama?o peque?o pero rinde bastante  la piel se siente fresca e hidratada y no deja sensacion grasosa.
9064,Ariel Mundis,1,03-Apr-18,,Came exactly as expect but came super early which is great
9065,Kelly,1,04-Apr-18,,This was an alright product. Did not leave my face feeling greasy. Would recommend!
9066,BreAnna,1,23-Feb-19,,This is only face moisturizer I can use! It’s a gel but it dries fast and doesn’t make my skin oily at all. Has a light fragrance  very refreshing.
9067,Lana Kleydman,1,22-Aug-17,,I love this product  especially suitable in the summer  very refreshing skin and moisturizing without weighting!
9068,Chelsea,0,16-May-19,,It smells so good and it feels so nice but it made my skin feel like it was burning and then left it red. I really wanted to like it but it didn’t do much good for my face.
9069,Billiejo Yingling,1,15-Jun-18,,Feels great on my combo skin. Helps keep it more balanced.
9070,ashleigh hall,1,20-May-15,,One time using this and you can really tell the difference! this is a wonderful product and love the price too. The longer I use it the more I love it. Skin feels fresh  healthy  and not greasy at all.It absorbs quickly  which is great if you hate a lotion feel. Feels like your skin is getting a drink of water.  No complaints  Love this product!
9071,Foxxy,1,10-Feb-17,,Was surprised to find this...shouldn t have been...Amazon is covering get all my needs...love it. Can shop from home and get what I need.
9072,Delia Grilo,1,17-Apr-19,,This product is really nice. A little goes a long way. I have combo skin and this is perfect. It goes on so smoothly on the face. Plus it smells really good. Highly recommend using this after cleansing the skin or exfoliating :)
9073,UTblue,1,31-Mar-13,,I use this product as my nighttime product after washing. It feels wonderful when I put it on and the gel soaks in quickly leaving my skin refreshed and soft. I really do enjoy using it. Moisture Rescue will be a staple.  This item feels wonderful and makes my skin feel soft . . . yes  I definitely recommend this product!
9074,Andrea,1,26-May-18,,Very moisturizing  doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I have perioral dermatitis and this has been great for getting much-needed moisture into my skin.
9075,Donna Uhlig,1,11-Sep-15,,Received in good time. This gel is amazing !! Leaves the skin refreshed and mouisturized. Wow  never thought a gel could do this. It is Wonderful !! I even apply it during the day for extra mouisturization. Great product !!!
9076,Ellen Doyle,1,28-Nov-15,,This is my favorite moisturizer ever. It is a soft gel that hydrates the skin and leaves it soft and supple without being greasy. It absorbs fast and lasts all day. I am now using this as my primary skin care product.
9077,Jen S.,1,18-Jun-14,,I have combination skin. My oily spots are my forehead and chin. This gel is great  it doesn t dry out my cheeks  but it keeps my forehead and chin from feeling/looking oily. I ve been using this for over a week and don t feel that it makes me break out or cause any other negative side effects.
9078,kdubs,0,25-Aug-18,,Came without any seal  as though it was used  returned  and resold to me.
9079,Aginger,1,09-Feb-14,,I have been using this gel for about three weeks now and this stuff is amazing! It leave my face feeling so soft and moisturized. My face looks like it s glowing without the oily feeling and look. The price is not bad either just truly awesome moisturizer. This is definitely a favorite of mine now.
9080,Tiff,1,25-Jun-18,,My holy grail moisturizer.
9081,Betty,1,18-Dec-17,,This is great but I don’t feel like it’s helping with my oily-ness. I’m hoping my skin will get get better eventually. Super absorbent and doesn’t have a strong smell.
9082,Cheyenne M Lambert,1,13-Jul-15,,I love this stuff  it has a nice scent to it and leaves my skin looking nice and moisturized instead of getting flaky like it can. Also  it doesn t leave the disturbing oily feel that moisturizers tend to leave for me. Glad I tried it out.
9083,Amazon Customer,1,02-Apr-19,,I like that its a 2 pack  I wont have to get another one for a while. This product is awesome  its lightweight and soaks in fast  makes my face feel really moisturized and soft.
9084,Sandy,1,28-Apr-19,,Not too pricy to use that on a daily basis. I keep on using this product for several years.
9085,Courtney Legoll,1,03-Jun-19,,I love this product! It is incredibly refreshing and leaves no residue or oily feeling. I would (and have) recommend it to friends and family so I’m recommending it to you too!
9086,Loretta Alger,1,16-Nov-18,,It works just like it is suppose to it appears to be well made.
9087,Maldo,1,23-Jun-18,,Good to keep your skin feeling fresh and oil free!
9088,ninakraw,1,21-Nov-15,,THIS MOISTURIZER IS GREAT! I love the way it feels on my face  the way it smells  and it doesn t make me feel oily or cause me to break out. My skin is super acne-prone and oily but this stuff makes my face feel great.
9089,Jenn,1,18-Aug-17,,I love this stuff! Perfect little moisturizer  and exactly what I was looking for.
9090,Brenda Lastarrr,1,18-Jun-16,,Great for the price as compared to four other similar products. Keeps my face and neck smooth and supple. Feels good going on my face and neck.
9091,Leslie Carolina Gamero,0,20-May-19,,It does not hydrate at all. Your face just ends up feeling very oily (and I have dry skin) and this   gel   just sits on top of your skin. Not good for sensitive skin either
9092,Rose S.,1,18-Sep-14,,For me  this product wasn t quite enough to help my dry face. It feels great when applied  leaving a clean feeling instead of that oily feeling you get with some facial products. Maybe this would be better for younger skin before you begin to wrinkle  but for more mature skin I d recommend something else.
9093,Lindy,1,12-Jul-17,,I have looked for a GEL moisturizer. I am so happy with the cool feel and benefits it provides without a greasy cream feel. I will buy again!
9094,Mikayla,1,22-Nov-15,,This is very nice. I like the texture  and the moisture seems to melt right into my skin  without any weird greasy or sticky textures. I will say the jar seems a bit small for the price  but so far  it has lasted quite a while.
9095,Edony V. Elder,1,02-Sep-13,,I use this after I finish my swim and in the shower. The chlorine makes my skin dry and stiff but this cream is terrific as it softens and makes my skin feel moist. I really do like this cream. Wish it came in a plastic jar as I am always worried about dropping it on the tile floor of the shower.
9096,Carie Cirillo,1,14-Nov-16,,Love this stuff. I always get another pack of 3 when I m down to one left. LoL This stuff makes my face feel so good. It s cool to the touch and once it s rubbed in  my face feels cleaner and fresher then it did before Would recommend
9097,Leah Wible,0,11-Mar-18,,Smells nice  and seemed moisturizing at first. But after two days of using it in the morning  I realized my skin felt tighter and dryer. It didn’t do anything for my dry skin. I don’t recommend.
9098,Amazon Customer,1,15-Apr-18,,This stuff is amazing. I recently learned that this hydrates your skin whereas a moisturizer well  moisturizes. It is very lightweight and isn t tacky when it dries. I use it after toning and my skin is not as dry as it used to be!
9099,Anja0825,1,04-Jul-14,,I love the feel of this when applying to my skin. It is very refreshing  almost like a cool splash of water. My skin feels soft and I did not have any irritation. The gel absorbs quickly into the skin and I do not feel any residue. I will definitely purchase this again!
9100,Gadget Guy,1,09-Dec-14,,Great facial moisturizer following a shave. Doesn t sting or have an oily feel  minimal fragrance which is great. A little goes a long way with me just sticking a finger in  rubbing it between my palms  and applying it from forehead to collarbone.
9101,Josh Moons,1,19-Jun-18,,Perfect for oily skin!
9102,nicole barry,1,30-Sep-15,,This moisturizer is great it s lightweight and really absorbs well into my skin. It s very similar to Mary Kay s oil free hydrating gel. Both are my favorite moisturizers and hydrate my skin perfectly without causing me to break out.
9103,Farmer,1,16-May-13,,This product is terrific for the price. Don t expect this to take over some $50 product but for what you pay  my face feels a noticeable difference and feels softer and hydrated. I use this at night prior to bed time. I m tell you the momment you run it into your skin you can feel it giving your skin the much needed hydration.
9104,LUV72,1,06-Mar-18,,Great moisture but not big enough bottle.
9105,Linda L.,1,24-Sep-17,,Nice gel cream  it s cool and non-sticky  absorbs right away. Great scent too.
9106,Amazon Customer,1,17-Oct-18,,Has a wierd feel  as it is a gel base and not a lotion  but is ultimately moisturizing .
9107,Jacqueline,1,03-Jan-17,4 people found this helpful,Until recently I have been buying the normal/combo version?even though I do have dry skin?since it was the only one available at the stores near me and I d assumed there would be little to no difference  given that they cost nearly the same. This is not the case. Like it s counterpart  the lightweight texture feels almost like water and immediately soaks into the skin; however  the dry skin formula is far more effective. Seriously  I think this is what they sprayed on Lady Cassandra whenever she d squawk  Moisturize Me! Moisturize Me!  I have to use less than half the amount I need previously  and my skin feels even softer. So if like me  you find yourself needing a rigorous moisture regime to keep your face from looking like the salt flats of Utah  I highly recommend the Moisture Rescue for dry skin.
9108,Jenna Flanders,1,10-Oct-18,,Absorbs instantly  makes my skin feel supple and glowy. I have acne prone skin and this is perfect!
9109,Rachael,1,24-Mar-19,,Very light  not greasy  absorbs quickly  great smell  very refreshing

9112,J Lynn Moore,1,01-Jan-14,,I love this product. It moisturizes without leaving a heavy residue or clogging your pores. It s light and very refreshing  good for day or night time applications. Good to use alone or under foundation make-up. Have been using for over one year and plan on continuing to use.
9113,Jacquelyn Brown,1,04-Sep-18,,Amazing. Even better for summer days with a little bit too much sun. I have oily skin and he gel doesn’t add to that  so I use this moisturizer 9-10 months out of the year. Winter months I switch to a cream based one
9114,Thomas Badzio,1,13-Mar-19,,Feels so good
9115,RV,1,29-Dec-16,,This is the best and you really should try it if you have dry skin. I use it in the winter when it is very dry out. Very refreshing.

9123,Terri Mendes,1,18-Sep-15,,So far  I am pleased with this product. Will see soon how well it works in colder months when heaters cause more dryness. If it works as well then  I have found skin bliss!
9124,ANNE FELY TENGCO AZUL,1,23-Jun-19,,I like it so effective in moisturizing my sensitive skin.
9125,Adrian Cephas,0,26-Jun-19,,This product gave me skin zero moisture  I felt dry immediately after applying it to my face. It also broke me out terribly. I wanted to like this affordable product but this ain’t it

9128,Rafael Rodrigues,1,10-Dec-18,,product of very good quality  works as indicated
9129,S Ashley,1,15-Jan-15,,This moisturizer feels cool on your skin and dries quickly  which makes it my favorite morning moisturizer to put on right before primer. It has a fresh scent which matches how it makes your skin feel. No negatives to mention.
9130,Laura franklin,1,18-Feb-14,,love this moisturizer i have dry skin and this is one of the only products i have found that helps! love the gel feel. would recommend this over the green version as it is not for dry skin. AWESOME product. will be buying more of this brand from now on.
9131,Aly Lynch,1,03-Jul-18,2 people found this helpful,I have super oily  acne prone skin (especially now at the height of summer in South Texas)  and I struggle with keeping my skin hydrated without overdoing it. I ve used water based and oil free moisturizers before  but they still either left my skin feeling grimy after a few hours or cost a crazy amount that my poor student self could not afford. This stuff has been AMAZING. It smells good  it s feels super light and cooling  it s affordable  and it has helped my skin SO MUCH. My acne has even cleared up a bit since I switched to this. I m in love.
9132,Ashes P.,1,28-Dec-17,,it keeps skin moisturized yet its not lasting.
9133,Franklin Kezerian,1,08-Feb-18,,I really liked the way that this product works. It has a nice and soft gel consistency and it makes your face feel smooth and soft. For the price and how well it works you cant beat it. The only thing i didnt like was the slight alcohol smell of it. It is very subtle but worries me it will dry me out.
9134,Janelle,1,13-Apr-15,,This stuff is awesome  love it  can t say that enough. I like to put it on right after a bath  it s cooling. Had a spot of persistant chapped and peeling skin  started using this stuff and it s gone  hoorah.

9137,Annimal Krakr,1,20-Sep-15,,Awesome Moisturizer!!!!! I have oily skin and mild acne and this stuff is awesome at keeping my skin happy. I personally love the scent. Smells like aloe to me. Compared to all those other moisturizers this is the only on that doesn t leave an oily feel.
9138,Kelly Taylor,1,24-Jul-13,,I don t really know what I was expecting of this product. It s okay. It feels nice on my face but I don t really like the smell. It doesn t do much in the way of moisture for me either. Skin products are hard to rate really. What works okay for me might be great for you.
9139,Melissa Bravo,1,02-Feb-19,,Very light feeling but still moisturized. I have acne and combination skin. This moisturizes without making my face oily.

9142,Hunter,1,13-Feb-12,2 people found this helpful,great product  my skin looks healthier ... but just to also throw this out there because it might not be just the moisturizer  but I also made a diet change.. I drink at least the recommended amount of water (64oz) and I never skip breakfast. Oh  plus I cut out sodas and cut way back on drinking.. been using this product plus diet for little over 2 weeks now and my skin is noticeably smoother. I need now to only wash it at night (to remove makeup) and when I wake up I just rinse with water and reapply a fresh coat of moisturizer and only need to use a a light coat of powder :) I will definitely be buying this item again.
9143,April D. Kitchen,1,13-Jan-13,,I have oily skin and this gel-cream moisturizes without making my skin more oily. I also tend to have very sensitive skin  and this does the trick. No breakouts and no itchiness or dryness. You only need a tiny amount to cover your entire face. I will definitely be buying this again.
9144,Emily Reed,1,22-Jun-18,,Love this stuff. Went through it awful fast because of the smaller container.
9145,Assistant Extraordinaire,1,31-May-15,,Very refreshing and perfect to use on hot nights when I don t feel like using a thick moisturizer or night cream on my face. Absorbs very quickly and doesn t leave a sticky residue.
9146,Dallasgrl,0,23-Oct-17,,It doesn t help with dry skin goes on like water
9147,Jackie Escobar,1,24-Jun-19,,This is the absolute best moisturizer I ever had. Is made my face so smooth and feel so nice and clean. I don’t have sensitive skin but it still works on just regular skin types
9148,SAK,0,08-May-19,,Not worth it- just sits on the skin- a weird film froms
9149,Luz,1,22-Mar-19,,Smells amazing! Love it my skin feels smoother!
9150,alex y lee,1,19-Dec-14,,I really enjoyed using this cream. It truly is refreshing and left no oily residue at all unlike most other facial moisturizers I ve tried. It also is not heavily scented like some creams. I apply it once in the morning and it keeps my face from drying in the Northeast cold throughout the day without the need to reapply. One more application before bedtime also keeps your skin feeling refreshed in the morning. I highly recommend this product for anyone who has dry skin or just need protection from the winter cold.
9151,Nicole Kopecky,1,28-Jun-16,,This is my favorite moisturizer out of all the kinds I ve tried over the years. I wish it was an all natural product  but it feels incredible on my face!
9152,Victoria Kim,1,23-Mar-17,,This is good for dry skin  But my skin type is combination type  so it s just good for my skin.
9153,ArleneQ,1,06-Jun-13,,This gel-cream is absolutely wonderful. my face is left hydrated and makes applying my foundation so much easier. I m glad i found this product. it keeps my skin moisturised for the whole day. i apply twice per day - morning and night and a little goes a LONG way!!!
9154,Summer,1,29-Dec-13,,I fell in love with gel moisturizers as soon as they hit the market! Garnier s Gel-Cream is just perfect for me! I use it in the morning (under my makeup)  and throughout the day to freshen up my makeup. And  of course  it s cheaper on Amazon!!
9155,Emily,1,17-Apr-19,,I’ve used this brand for years and it’s the best moisturizer for oily skin!
9156,Estefania Pimentel,1,04-May-19,,Amazing
9157,RWmom,1,23-May-17,,I use Moisture Rescue every morning and have for a few years now. I love it  doesn t leave my skin greasy. It really adds moisture.
9158,as always,1,02-Apr-15,,this is the only moisturizer that straddles the line for my daughter in law between moisturizing too much and causing additional breakouts  and not moisturizing enough and her having dry skin. she d tried all the brands out there and lucked into the garnier product and has been very pleased (for reference  she s a lightly competed Asian skin tone)
9159,Michelle B.,1,10-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,I have an oily T-zone and yet dry  flaky patches in other places. TBH  I bought 2 because I misplaced my first one without even trying it. But after reading the reviews  I bought it again because I was looking forward to using it. I love it. My skin feels hydrated and it is light. It is a small jar  like fits in the palm of my hand. A little goes a long way. I also have sensitive skin and I have not had any issues  like break outs or clogged pores. AND I live in FL with very fickle weather lately. Cold  rainy  sunny... I have used this daily for a few weeks and I am very pleased with BOTH purchases(I found the first one I bought  thank goodness!). Even though this is more affordable than many other moisturizers  I still felt like spending more than $6 for a small jar was too much. But I really do like it and a few dots on my face are enough.
9160,SerialReviewer,1,19-Mar-14,,My lips were chapping off the other day  so I put the Gel-cream on. It healed in less than 30 seconds. But of course  it hurts first. I take this as it works like a champ. There is smell that comes with it neither. It just feels nice.
9161,A. Weaver,1,27-Nov-12,,I have always had oily skin and I since I am 32 now I wanted to help my skin. I have always hated moisturizing because of my skin being so oily. This product is perfect! It is not heavy and it does not make my skin more oily. I am so glad I found a product to help my skin. It really softens it.
9162,Amazon Customer,1,16-Jan-19,,I like this. Good for dry skin. Helps a lot during hot summer and cold winter
9163,Amazon Customer,1,26-Apr-19,,This product leaves your face moisturized without being oily.it has a nice smell. I dont like how it didnt come completely filled with products but amazing after all.
9164,Andria M. Bonbright,1,29-Jun-15,,I LOVE the Garnier Moisture Rescue Gel-cream! I am a repeat customer & have bought 7 jars of it. I am 46 years old with oily/dry T-zone problems and this is the ONLY moisturizer that instantly absorbs into my skin (ie does not sit on it for hours like heavier ones). You can use as much of it as you want and it never gets tacky.
9165,Tara,1,11-Feb-16,One person found this helpful,Lightweight  love the smell  and it moisturizes well. A little goes a super long way.
9166,Grrrrrrll,1,07-Mar-16,,This is a pretty good moisturizer  it is almost as good as Clinique s moisture surge. It absorbs quickly so it is perfect for under my makeup.
9167,Brynn,1,21-Oct-15,,I put this on each night after washing my face. I love the smell  and it keeps my skin from drying out too much but doesn t make it oily.
9168,Prime customer,1,18-Mar-19,,It’s very good...After applying the skin feels fresh...I liked it very much..thanks for the GARNIER..
9169,Kay Bedford,1,09-May-14,,I went through an entire package of the regular Refreshing Gel-Cream earlier this month. I loved that lotion  especially in the summer. It really is refreshing. I have terribly dry skin and that lotion was almost perfect. However  after switching to this lotion  I think I ve found my holy grail lotion for dry skin. The smell is nice  it feels very light but works really well with my dry skin. Definitely recommended!
9170,Polopony,1,13-Jun-14,,A good value for a good product that does what it says--keeps my skin refreshed  and isn t sticky. Better price than in the store (get free shipping!) and the jar is designed to take up less space in your cabinet. Nice.
9171,Maria H.,1,12-Nov-18,,My face is glowing thanks to this cream... that’s all I have to say.
9172,Amazon Customer,1,19-Aug-18,,Moisturizer.
9173,cedrerouge ,1,24-Sep-13,,This was perfect when traveling through hot  dry Utah and Arizona! I still keep it on hand because it is a nice base moisturizer. It doesn t seem to improve my skin overtime but keep it from being dry. On daily basis I prefer my Aveeno ultra soothing daily moisturizer. It arrived fast and is a good product that my daughter and I will use again!
9174,hyunjung kim,1,31-May-14,,I used the other (normal skin) and loved it. I wanted to try this one so ordered. The product arrived on time. However  the glass was all shattered and I almost cut myself. The first time I received the other ones  they arrived just fine. I am not sure how this happened. I hope they replace it as soon as possible.  *Received a new one. They responded very quickly to my comment above and sent me a new one (not broken this time) within 2 days! Amazing! Will try this one once I finish using the cream for normal skin.
9175,Andrea Tze Ann Koh,1,27-Mar-19,,Liked that it wasn t too creamy and kept face feeling fresh!
9176,Thuy Nguyen,1,27-Sep-18,,The price is really good: light weight product  quick absorb and the smell is good. It d good for combination skin like mine  T-area is not irritated.
9177,L. K. Windham,1,29-Jan-15,,I love this face lotion because it s a cool-feeling gel as opposed to the typical cream. Goes on light and refreshing  and has a light scent that s pleasant :) I don t have oily skin  just a few spots that get a bit dry  so I apply this once or twice a day (morning and night) and am good to go! Their pink version for drier skin is heavier and I feel like it clogs my pores  so I much prefer this product.
9178,Amazon Customer,0,10-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,I wouldn t recommend for sensitive skin. I had eching and small red bumps on my face after applying this cream.
9179,Kiesha,0,24-Dec-17,,Isn t really what i expected. Doesnt moisturize much. Maybe its just me.
9180,Maria,1,09-Jan-19,,I like the product but the packing get damages
9181,Amazon Customer,1,31-Oct-18,,Very happy with the product
9182,The Dog Lady,0,30-Dec-15,,I needed a moisturizer. I love Garnier. I hate this product. It does nothing. Very lightweight  lovely scent  but useless for my skin type.
9183,Amber Stone,0,01-Aug-17,,Tried this product because it says it s good for combo skin and some reviews said it was good for their oily skin. Left me feeling so greasy after short amount of time  gave it many uses with same results.
9184,Meg Daehling,1,14-Oct-14,,Quick shipping  it works good for someone like me and my fiance who struggle with dry facial skin. We both have seen a progress within a few days. I will be buying again but for cheaper with coupons.
9185,Nadia,1,17-Jun-19,,This is my new favorite moisturizer  hydrating AF!!
9186,Karen H.,1,24-Feb-19,,this is amazing!! not sticky at all  my face feels like a smooth bottom
9187,Sara,1,21-Apr-17,,Really great for super dry  flaky skin. Very cooling.
9188,Love2Travel,1,22-Dec-13,,This is so hard to find in the drug stores so I m glad that Amazon carries it now. it s way more moisturing than the green one which is for regular skin. It is perfect for the winter months. Hope they don t discontinue the item.
9189,Amazon Customer,1,15-Oct-18,,Great  nice feel  nice tingle  great moisturizing effect
9190,MRZ.GILBABY,1,04-May-17,,Leaves my skin feeling smooth but I don t like the smell.
9191,Anne,1,13-Feb-17,,The only reason I m giving it a four is because I m not a giant fan of the gel feel. I use it once every other day now.
9192,Mona,1,09-Jan-16,,Love all Garnier products and they are priced much lower on amazon than in retail stores. Would recommend and would buy again.
9193,Norma D. Novela,1,18-Sep-16,,This moisturizer made my skin really soft and didn t make it feel dry. A little goes a long way.
9194,Feba M.,1,26-Oct-18,,I really like this product. My skin is so oily and acne prone. So I hate using moisturizers. But this one does not make my face oily and also it was really refreshing. Loved it
9195,Melissa,1,08-Nov-15,,Love! This is so light weight and refreshing! The smell is not the greatest but it fades. I have combination skin and this really helps me even out the dry spots i have. Not to mention that tgis is a good base before applying foundation ladies!
9196,Just Jo,1,14-Apr-14,,I use this daily. My skin loves it. Applies on cool and penetrate into your skin without feeling sticky or heavy. A little goes a long way. A jar lasts me 2 months and that s after using it twice daily.
9197,Amazon Customer,1,23-Feb-16,One person found this helpful,I have already been using this product for a few days and I feel a great difference!! My skin feels softer and doesn t look as dry. My makeup sticks better with this moisturizer and it isn t oily at all.It is exactly as promised and I guarantee that you will buy it again!!
9198,Juju,1,26-Apr-16,,Amazing face moisturizer  and doesn t leave your face oily  only soft  and smooth! I use this every day!
9199,skababy69,1,29-Apr-15,12 people found this helpful,I am very particular on what products I use as my skin is sensitive and very dry. Let me first say that this product is by far the best I have ever used. My skin is more suptle  glowing and healthier looking than it ever has been. The cream is more gel like  cooling and non scented so you dont have to worry about any off putting smells. Secondly  you only need very little as it goes a long way. Easy  non greasy application and doesn t itch or peel. I am sold and I highly recommend this product to anyone whom has tried other creams or facial gels and they have failed. Thanks Garnier!
9200,Trina,1,24-Mar-16,,Very light  dries quickly  doesn t leave oily residue. I haven t had any break outs because of it so I like it!
9201,Mr. Jeff,1,27-Jan-16,9 people found this helpful,I d like to first start off by saying that this is no longer my primary moisturizer. I still keep it around  but I ve since switched to Sebamed Clear Face Care Gel. I switched because I wanted an unscented gel moisturizer.  If you ve never used a gel moisturizer before  give it a try. I was originally looking for a moisturizer that would leave my skin feeling hydrated without giving me that mirror-like grease sheen that I ve unfortunately grown so accustom to. I found it!  The pros: - My skin has a healthy glow  but without that shine! - Hydrates pretty well. - Doesn t make me break out. - Good price!  The cons: - Added fragrance. Though it smells good  I have sensitive skin and would prefer a version of this product that doesn t contain fragrance. - Face feels a bit sticky after applying. Fine for me  but might be an issue for people who want to apply makeup after.
9202,Boris,1,09-May-19,,Does the job love the way it makes my face look and feel  very lightweight and moisturizing  highly recommend it!
9203,kiki,1,12-Sep-17,,The smell and texture are amazing
9204,AshDD,1,24-Jan-16,,Love this product. I wear it every morning under my BB cream. Leaves skins soft and hydrated. Works great on hands too.
9205,Cindy,1,14-Sep-15,,This is by far the best moisturizer I ve ever used to manage oily shine. And it works extremely well. I live in the desert Southwest and it keeps my skin hydrated quite well.
9206,Ryan Teal,1,30-Jun-16,,The only thing that helps my dry skin. Super light and not greasy at all
9207,Amazon Customer,1,03-Oct-16,,Love this product. I have some trouble finding it at stores  so I was thrilled I could get it on Amazon. I have normal/oily/combo skin (depending on the weather) and this works all the time. Pleasant  slight scent  dries perfectly  is good for my sensitive skin  and keeps me hydrated. No heavy or greasy feeling
9208,nini m,1,24-May-19,,Non greasy. Goes on light and smooth. It’s the perfect moisturizer for dry skin. Will buy again
9209,Alabama,1,20-Sep-15,,Feels so good on my face  light and absorbs quickly. I especially like to use this gel under my make-up. Great bargain and a great product.
9210,Jackie,1,24-Apr-19,,I love gel moisturizer and i love how nourishing this gel feels on my skin and leaves my skin looking dewy
9211,BecaLynn,1,04-May-15,,Non oily! Great for my oily skin. Will use nothing else! I have tried the name brand Clinique and all I can say is save your money and go with this!
9212,Shantal Huerta,1,23-Mar-18,,This is the best daily face cream for combination skin I have tried so far!!! I use it daily and it has an amazing cooling feeling to it. Its like a gel but without the greasiness of it!!! I love it.
9213,flyingpig,1,28-Mar-15,,i use this stuff whenever i get out of the shower and my skin is dry. it works really well. super hydrating and refreshing. not sticky or heavy at all.
9214,Bambi 0101,0,18-May-17,,My skin feels sticky hours after use. It s not exactly what I wad expecting.
9215,Z. Basta,1,27-Sep-14,,It was definitely a lighter moisturizer than many others I ve found. I ended up subscribing to get some every couple months for almost two years since I liked it so much.
9216,vicki thomas,1,20-May-17,,OMG! I LOVE THIS STUFF!
9217,leila,1,10-Aug-16,,I m not a pro in using cosmetic product. A friend introduced me and honestly I am happy with it.
9218,Alyssa,1,28-Sep-18,,First time using this product and I love how light it is. Most moisturizers are thick and greasy but I didn t have that issue with this one! definitely will be buying again!
9219,Amazon Customer,1,02-Sep-17,,This is the first time I had tried this and it feels so cool and refreshing on my skin and moistures well too.

9223,Kanish Pelt,1,20-Oct-18,,This product leaves My face feeling cool and refreshed!!
9224,Optimus Crymes,1,23-Mar-13,,Garnier is becoming a favorite of mine for beauty products. This gel cream is very light and provides just enough moisture to keep my skin going all day and without breakouts. I love it and recommend it without worry.
9225,LeSpicyBrownCow,0,15-Nov-17,,I decided to try this moisturizer after reading the reviews. The package came on time  in perfect condition. However  this moisturizer feels like it is 90% water and 10% the cheapest moisturizers in existence. I have used it for 2 days so far  so I have applied it maybe 3-4 times. My skin feels drier than before  and has even begun to flake extremely badly. There is literally nothing to this moisturizer  it goes on like its made of just water.  I think that this might make a decent warm weather moisturizer for someone with normal skin  it s extremely light! But it does not moisturize at all  and perhaps even dried out my skin. Might be a good match for someone else  but it has already wreaked havoc on my skin.  * if you have combination skin that is on the drier side like mine  DO NOT get this moisturizer. Try the normal skin option (pink jar) or a different moisturizer altogether. Hope this helps!
9226,Chen Chen Chen,1,18-Nov-18,,I have use this product from more than a year  the product come fast and maintain good quality.
9227,Karay,0,23-Sep-18,,This is ok I guess  but I didn’t like at all. Smells kind of like alcohol and almost seemed to dry out my skin. Was also a little sticky.
9228,D. Demarco,1,05-Feb-14,,I love this product! It is so light and feels so refreshing. It s not thick and absorbs completely leaving my skin soft and surprisingly moisturized without a greasy feel.
9229,Raevyn Rickman,1,08-Feb-18,,This stuff is absolutley amazing! I have dry acne prone skin and I ve been using this for a week and my skin has cleared up! And whats even better is a little bit goes a long way. This will last me for months if not longer.
9230,SoCali,1,03-Sep-12,One person found this helpful,I m an adult male who is one of the  lucky  ones to have acne-prone  combination skin along with a mild case of dermatitis. I use benzoyl peroxide products which tends to leave my face dry and scaly (and the dermatitis doesn t help either). I traditionally used cream-based face lotions which tended to make my face feel greasy and didn t always alleviate my dry skin. I ran out of my existing Neutrogena face lotion and decided to see if I can find something better for my skin.  This Garnier product sounded promising being a gel-based form and the great reviews on here convinced me to try it out.  Well  I m happy to report that this gel has worked wonders for my skin. First of all  it s very light and goes on the skin smooth. After I put it on  my skin feels refreshed and cool. Second  it works very well all day to keep my skin hydrated and moisturized. Lastly  it actually helps calm down my dermatitis and my face does not feel irritated as much as it used to.  I really hope they keep making this product as I will be a life-long consumer as long as it s around. It works that well for my skin.
9231,Memasohm,1,24-Jun-19,,Good product
9232,Jennifer,1,23-Dec-14,,Only moisturizer that doesn t make my acneic combination skin flip out and overproduce sebum. Very light and fresh. I love it  definite repurchase for me.
9233,Amazon Customer,1,09-Dec-18,,It did add moisture to my face! But it doesn t last very long!
9234,Kae,1,30-Jul-14,,This product has made an amazing difference in my skin. The area under my eyes and around my cheeks looks really smooth and refreshed. I absolutely love this product!
9235,Kimberly K. Sams,1,09-Sep-13,,Keeps my face hydrated until I wash it. Has a great refreshing smell. Doesn t break out my skin. A tiny bit covers my whole face. Great product at a fraction of the cost of comparable products.
9236,amy blevins,1,13-Oct-16,,Light weight but still very hydrating. I love this product.
9237,R. Grillo,1,13-Aug-15,,I bought this here because the one I bought at WalMart was missing the security seal sticker.... Gross! Anyway  I got it because I have dry skin on my face but pretty much all lotions make me break out horribly. I was avoiding them to the point that my face was flaking. I wanted to find an oil-free moisturizer in the hopes that I wouldn t break out. It s advertised as a  fruit water  and it smells pleasant. A little goes a long  long way and it lasts a while. It doesn t seem to work as well as lotion in the moisturizing aspect (my face still gets dry)  but I only put this on once a day and there s no oil. The oil in the lotion moisturized me all day  but also left me with a greasy  broken out face. Anyway  give it a try. For the price  it s a great option. I d rather be a little dry than oily and broken out. I really think if I remembered to put it on more frequently  it would solve my problem.
9238,Sif,1,10-Oct-15,,I absolutely love this moisturizer. It absorbs quickly without leaving my face feeling sticky or greasy.
9239,Amazon Customer,1,15-Apr-14,,I use this after having used microdermabrasion crystals on my face. It preserves the skin softness yielded by the dermabrasion  and presents drying without clogging pores.

9244,Hala Saad,1,08-Apr-14,,I have oily skin that is very prone to breakouts  and almost every cream I use to protect my face from New York winters (harsh  cold  awful) just make my skin gross. I use this every morning before heading out and at night if I feel like my face is dry. It works great as a preventative treatment; it won t do much to heal skin  but this is the first winter ever where I haven t had chaffing on my face from the wind and cold. I have used it consistently and it does protect my skin!

9256,lily,1,18-Feb-14,,It doesn t really work on my face because it is a little bit irritating to my skin. However  I used it for my body  feels great. It runs very fast  I guess because I use this for my body. I am 24  asian. My skin gets really dry from oklahoma weather. I would like to get some recommendation for body moisture. I mean things really get absorbed on your skin.
9257,Caitlin,1,28-Dec-11,One person found this helpful,This is a very good gel cream. My other moisturizer was kind of heavy and was clogging my pores  so I wanted something light and refreshing. This is just that. I love it! There is a nice scent and a refreshing tingle when you put it on your face. It soaks in immediately. and makes skin soft and smooth. Very nice.
9258,Irina Escoffery,1,23-Mar-12,,Very soothing and moisturizing gel liquid that feels like a splash of fresh water on your face. I use it after any facial procedure and also every day in a regular basis. Very affordable price to compare with other brands similar products.

9325,Anna,1,18-Jul-12,4 people found this helpful,Ever since moving to the US and having to find new beauty products  I was struggling to find a moisturizer which did not lead to my eyes burning terribly after a few hours. Even the ones with no fragrances  no preservative and advertised to be completely hypoallergenic still irritated my eyes. Of course I never even let the product get close to the eye region  however  the irritation still ocurred. Until I found this miracle gel! Not only do my eyes not burn  I can even use it close to and around the eyes  and they actually seem to perk up! I have been using it now for about three weeks and it has changed my life. Dear Garnier people: Please never change or discontinue this product! And did I mention  it also leaves my skin nicely moisturized  refreshed and clear  and is perfect for day as well as night time use as it does not leave any residue on the pillows.

It makes the skin on my face feel refreshed and pliable but never sticky. This surprised me at first because when I dip my fingers in the jar  it feels like the  Dippity-Do  we used on our hair when I was a kid. But this gel-cream goes on smoothly with a satiny soft finish  and a little dab goes a long way. The fragrance is very mild and fresh. I won t say it s making me look ten years younger  but my face definitely feels clean  moisturized  and healthy!
9341,Mona,1,27-Oct-14,,Love the cream. You can feel the skin getting moisturized just like drinking cool water when thirsty.

9358,JenMExx,1,30-Jan-15,,I usually have combo  sensitive  clear skin. However  this winter  I was getting dry patches and my sunscreen wasn t enough(yes  I use sunscreen even in winter). So I needed an extra moisturizer  to put under my sunscreen. This is perfect!! First  the scent is so refreshing. I ve used Garnier in the past but never anything like this. I ve also never used a gel cream before. It goes on cool and quick absorbs allowing me to immediately put my sunscreen over it. I ve been using it for two months and haven t had any dry patches on my face  at all! Price was good for the size and I still have half of it left!!
9359,Sue Ab,1,10-Mar-15,,One of the best with its cool feel on the face
9360,Mo Gareau (Ringey),1,17-Aug-14,5 people found this helpful,I like this a lot but it must be used with a light touch or it gets goopy and sort of rolls up on your skin. It sinks in really wll  which is what makes me think I can add another coating. The results of using it for a few months now are good  though not great. but I still use it and recommend it. Great price too!

9369,JBW,1,31-Jul-13,2 people found this helpful,I can t say enough about this moisturizer. I have this one (green gel)  the one for dry skin (pink gel) and the renew cr?me (white cream). So far during the summer months this one works just fine  but I do sometimes apply the renew cr?me at night. And  I m guessing the one for dry skin will be my everyday one for the winter months. They all smell wonderful  especially the one for normal skin. I hope Garnier comes out with a body lotion that smells just like it; I will definitely buy it if they do!

9384,panda_lover,0,07-Jul-15,One person found this helpful,This is nothing but watered down lotion. It is just water. It does nothing for my skin. I ve been using it for a couple of days now and see no difference in the baginess of my eyes or moisture to my skin. Nor does this make my skin feel softer. I prefer the olay/loreal face lotions over this. I took a chance on this due to the other reviews even though if you look at the ingredients there is nothing in it that would help your skin like peptides  acids  etc. I do not recommend this product.

Honestly  Idk if this product even works that well because the SMELL IS HORRIBLE. I ve never smelt something to chemically and just like rubbing alcohol in my life. It smells like straight vodka or something. It might be great...but I cannot get past the smell.

I couldn t believe how well it worked. It was almost like giving my face a drink of water. It hydrated my skin without leaving any greasy residue. Great moisturizer to apply before makeup. I used my own Moisture Rescue Gel Cream this morning and my skin has been feeling great all day. This 1.7oz container should last quite a while since it only takes a small dab to moisturize your whole face.
9422,NyL,1,06-Dec-17,,I love this product. My husband and I have mixed and oily skin. Since I discovered this moisturizer on 2014  I have been using it. This time I bought 5 items because of the black Friday discount.  If you have oily or mixed skin  gel texture in a moisturizer is your best option. You won t experience an outbreak caused by your moisturizer again. Plus I love it on summer time  because its so fresh and it s absorbed so fast by your skin.  Strongly recommended.
9423,JustJill,0,25-Sep-14,2 people found this helpful,My skin is very sensitive and breaks out when its looked at wrong. I was looking for a light cream for everyday to help keep my skin healthy. This cream feels good going on but didn t react well with my skin. It felt tacky and sticky  not refreshing. I noticed the next days my skin started looking red and irritated. I m disappointed and gone back to pure coconut oil.

The ingredients in this product are much the same to this wonderful hair & facial moisturizer that I would spray like water on my thirsty face & hair...it cost me a fortune from the salon! This stuff does the same magic with skin thirsty for moisture...no grease just pure liquid that your face absorbs on contact! Love it!
9429,snjgringotts,1,13-Nov-15,,This is my all time favorite. I always have it with me! It s perfect amount of gel moisture yet doesn t weigh down on my skin. Feels cool and refreshing. Will continue to buy this.
9430,Mrs Ludeman,0,06-Jan-15,One person found this helpful,This moisturizer did nothing for me. The scent was very mild  and the gel texture did make it feel refreshing  but it was useless to me as a moisturizer. After I would apply it  it almost rolled off of my face in little pieces. It was really hard to explain  but it did not in any way moisturize my dry skin. I also felt like my subsequent makeup application was very uneven. I would not recommend this to anyone. I ve since purchased Aveeno Positively Radient Skin Daily Moisturizer and I LOVE it.
9431,G. Amis,1,25-Jan-13,,Especially great for oily skin. Refreshing for skin that is prone to break outs. Non-oily and makes a perfect makeup base.

The SkinActive gel goes on smoothly (I like that it s gel and not a cream) and moisturizes well without kicking off more oil production like some moisturizing products do.
9436,Amazon Customer,1,09-Nov-15,,Love everything about this gel. The feel of it the smell and it moisturizers my face so well. Will definitely purchase again.
9437,K. Hills,1,29-Jan-13,,I love this gel cream! This is my 3rd jar I just bought. I have really noticed my skin looking and feeling better. I really have dry skin and this has helped a lot  plus there is no greasy feeling left on my hands or face. I even use it on my elbows!
9438,NMM,1,18-Dec-14,,love it!
9439,Shopaholic,1,19-Jun-16,2 people found this helpful,Been using this for 4 years  it definitely works well for none oily skins. I do have the T-zone  but this is fairly neutral to keep both the oily and none oily part moisture. Just apply it after each wash and do the Zoolander face at the mirror and you will be one good looking fellow!
9440,Corena Deeter,1,28-Jul-15,,Love this product. I recently have started using on other places besides my face and it works great. It s not greasy  fella light on my face.

9443,MomOfTwo,0,26-Nov-16,,I decided to go with this product and another one. I ve used this off and on for the last couple weeks. I have to say I don t agree with most of the reviews on it. I feel like it does provide a cooling relief when applying however it s not very hydrating nor do I feel like I m putting anything that actually penetrate into my skin or maybe it s because I d like to see you cream on my skin when I Apply it.
9444,Jonathon,1,24-Feb-12,One person found this helpful,I love how lightly scented the gel is. At first I was skeptic  but I found that it was worth it. Such a small amount goes a long way. It s a great gel if you are on the go and need to take it with you. It really helped my acne and it isn t oily at all. It also helped with the flaky skin.  But  if your skin is already oily  make sure to give it a little rinse later in the day to help fight the greasy stuff.
9445,W,1,31-Jul-15,,Works good! Smells natural and fresh.
9446,amy robbins,0,16-Jul-14,,Didn t seem to do anything. It felt  wet  when you put it on and didn t moisturize at all. Waste of money!
9447,Helen,1,05-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,I was excited for this purchase but it s not tamper proof? There was no seal when I twisted off the lid. There was only 1 transparent sticker on the lid and jar that s easily moveable. Kind of sketched out to use it.  Edit: Others said that s how their product arrived too. Assuming it s untampered  the gel smells nice and moisturizes my face well (combo/oily). My only gripe is the small size of the jar.
9448,Reviewer&MakeUp Junkie,1,11-Feb-17,,So refreshing. I use this gel to refresh and prepare my face for my makeup routine. I apply in my face with my fingers and i let it for 5 minutes  and after I applied my Smashbox Primer  foundation  setting powder  etc etc.  My face looks refreshed and my makeup looks better than ever. So happy I bought this gel. I will buy more and make this part of my makeup routine.

9468,HelloReese,0,18-Feb-16,2 people found this helpful,I was very excited to try this moisturizer because I had read reviews where people likened it to a more affordable version of Clinique Moisture Surge  which I have tried and liked. Unfortunately  this product isn t an alternative to the Clinique product  and it didn t work well for me.  After applying the moisturizer  my face felt a bit sticky  which somewhat faded away with time. About half an hour after applying the moisturizer  however  my face felt just as dry as when I applied it. I have normal/dry skin  so appreciate a skin quenching moisturizer  but can also use most light moisturizers or gel based moisturizers with good results. This one  however  left me feeling like I hadn t used any moisturizer. I tried it for several weeks  but its impact on my skin did not improve. When I applied it at night  I woke up in the morning with my skin feeling a bit tight  dry  and definitely did not feel like I had slept in a moisturizer.  One positive about this product is that it has a very pleasant  fresh scent. Every Garnier product I have tried has a great scent  which I really appreciate in beauty  hair  and body products. But the scent isn t enough to keep me using this moisturizer that doesn t moisturize adequately. Perhaps it works well for people with very oily skin.
9469,Celia Ormes,1,05-Jun-14,,I love the feeling of freshness this product gives to the skin everywhere.... I love it and will recommend it to anyone..
9470,Nick Marshall,1,17-Jan-14,,It feels wonderful right as you put it on  but doesn t last more than 10 minutes  so you may have to reapply once more depending on your skin type.

I don t like moisturizers that leave an oily residue behind because then I just feel gross (also leads to breakouts)  but this stuff is perfect. It keeps my skin smooth and soft but there is absolutely no oily-ness left behind. I ve gotten all of my friends hooked on this stuff as well. It s just amazing. Seriously  use this if you re looking for moisturizer. It is amazing.

Absolutely love it  and the scent isn t overbearing.

Thought id just use it as a hand lotion then to not waste it but it dried my hands out. They made this for people who don t really need a moisturizer but want one anyways. No benefits from it.

9503,Natalya N.,1,02-Dec-17,,First of all  for the price of the product it’s very good quality; the cream is more on the watery side  which is ideal for my combination skin because it’s not too heavy. The smell is light and fresh and by just applying about a quarter size of cream  it will provide all over coverage and not dry out your face. 10/10 would recommend !!

I wore none  but now my face is great and im not ashamed of my natural skin and my makeuo applies flawlessly . i recommend using this after you wash your face   before makeup  after showers  and before bed.

If you have sensitive skin DO NOT purchase this product! I would give zero stars if I could! A total waste of money!

9529,Rei,1,06-Sep-12,69 people found this helpful,I ve seen this product advertised in many magazines and decided to buy it from Amazon after reading all the amazing reviews  and I was not disappointed.  My skin is extremely sensitive - I ve broken out in irritating rashes and acne from using Neutrogena  Clinique  Clean & Clear  and Lancome products before -   and it was super dry before I looked around for a new moisturizer  so it s pretty difficult to find a good product for my skin. Not to mention  I also have a tendency for eye irritation to anything with a strong fragrance  so I was apprehensive about this cream.  This moisturizer completely restored my dry  flaky skin. My skin can now withstand cold  dry winters. I ve never had such smooth and clear skin before. It s very absorbent and lightweight at the same time  and it wasn t damaging in any way to my skin at all. The smell didn t bother me at all  and it made me feel very refreshed. The jar might seem small  but it lasts for awhile  considering the quality of it. Moreover  my makeup goes on more smoothly and lasts longer after using this moisturizer.  I dab it on every morning  and it keeps my skin moisturized for the entire day. You do not need a lot. A little goes a long way. I bought it in February and it lasted me until June  for a total of four months of use - an amazing deal for such a wonderful product.  Forget all those expensive moisturizers. This is all you need.  UPDATE (4/19/15): I started using this product in 2011  and 4 years later  it’s still my go-to moisturizer. For reference  I have combination skin (used to have dry skin). I started using this moisturizer when I was 18  and I’m 22 now.  Also  protip: Amazon usually has really good prices with the S&S option  and they have the $1/$1.50 off coupon from time to time  to save you even more money. That means that there are times when it’ll only cost you under $5 to buy this moisturizer.
9530,CalledInSick,0,12-Feb-17,2 people found this helpful,Contains dimethicone as the primary ingredient... while not technically harmful it s not good for your skin either... no thanks! Go ahead and google dimethicone  I ll wait...
9531,Magdalene Luka,1,02-Nov-13,61 people found this helpful,I want to start by saying that I don t think this product is entirely accurate in its own description. If you have skin that actually does run dry  this probably won t be enough for you. In fact  this product is best for people with combination or even oily skin  or people like me who just hate how heavy and gross creams or lotions feel on their faces. This product feels like spreading cool water on your face  except it sinks in and stays with you. Like I started to say before  I hate heavy lotion moisturizers in anything less than bitter cold weather. They make my combination skin feel oily and kind of sticky  and they often break me out. This product doesn t do any of that. That s about all I can give you if you re considering trying it. I ll make some comparisons to other products just in case that helps anyone. Cetaphil and CeraVe I think are the most common  light  facial lotions  and this is much lighter and feels much cleaner. Garnier has another moisturizing gel very similar to this one (the green one) and if that one wasn t quite enough moisture for you  but you liked that it felt nice and light  this is a great upgrade. If you ve used Clinique s moisturizing gel  this is quite similar in consistency except that it has a little bit of a fruity (apple?) scent. The only issue I can think of is that this isn t the most hygienic way to package a product like this since you have to put your fingers directly into it. If you wash your hands before using it  though  you should be fine. I really can t recommend this highly enough and I wish I could give it six or seven stars. It s by far my favorite drugstore moisturizer  and close to my all-time favorite just behind Clinique s gel.
9532,Amazon Customer,0,09-May-17,10 people found this helpful,I have combo skin and this is hands down the WORST product I have ever put on my face. It felt great when I put it on. It felt nice and light. I put it on in the evening before bed  and when I woke up  my ENTIRE forehead was covered in blemishes. I used about a half of a pea sized amount. For someone that RARELY gets a single blemish at all  I am absolutely mortified. So now  here I am trying to clear them up. I am a makeup artist  so having clients see my face this way is not good. Had to give it a star  because it wont let me give zero stars. Absolutely horrible.
9533,Author Sable Sylvan (Heather Davies),1,20-May-19,,I originally bought this back in maybe 2017 because I didn’t like the white streaks I got from cream moisturizers. This is a relatively lightweight gel moisturizer. I got this via Prime Now so if my review doesn’t show as Verified...I don’t know what that’s about.  This is a basic bare bones gel moisturizer. Not sure if you like gel moisturizer? This is a fine intro product.  Before I get into potential negatives  I want to make it clear I like this moisturizer for what it is. It’s a basic gel moisturizer I can slap on after washing my face or using a sheet mask. It doesn’t have many active ingredients like Retinol or something. All I want it to do is moisturizer and it does that.  It’s a gel moisturizer. It’s lighter than cream moisturizers. It’s pretty basic. It doesn’t leave steaks.  I’m taking a star off for stickiness. I don’t know if it’s sticky because I use too much or because I mix it with actives like Retinol but it stays tacky for a while on my skin. I also don’t think it’s a great value at its usual price point but I am not taking a star off for that because this review is about the product itself  not pricing.  I think the Moisture Bomb The Antioxidant edition  in the blue glass jar  is a five star product that makes this a four star product by comparison. The formula is less tacky and I like the addition of hyaluronic acid in the other product.  If you don’t like the stereotypical Garnier types of scents  this isn’t for you. I personally like it. It’s a bit floral and fruity and citric. There is a bit of an alcohol smell.  If you don’t like glass jars this isn’t for you. I personally prefer pumps and plastic and something portable but I am not taking a star off for that.  Although this gel is green I don’t see any color correction happening on my red skin. I’m yellow toned but red due to acne. I don’t care about color correction but don’t expect it from this product.  If you need SPF  this isn’t for you. If you don’t want or need SPF (I have low Vitamin D and my doc personally said I didn’t need the SPF but you need to talk to your own doc and make your own decisions) for any reason  this could be a good option.
9534,Danno and Avey,1,15-Aug-17,,I have slightly fussy skin; Gel-type moisturizers typically get absorbed and leave my skin feeling dry and tight about 30m after application  but the richer and creamier types just sit on the surface and leave my face an oil slick.  I use this moisturizer to supplement the CeraVe that I already use and love. (Here s a link  if you re curious:?CeraVe Moisturizers  Moisturizing Cream  16 Ounce?) It s thin and light enough to help add a little bit of extra moisture  but does not have any of the tightness or weird dryness that usually accompanies gels. This particular Gel Moisturizer does come in a smaller container (which seemed a little disconcerting at first)  but a little definitely goes a long way. For my whole face and neck  I typically use a pea-sized amount. The moisturizer itself has a strange creaminess (for a Gel)  and a very subtle  fresh fragrance. (When I purchased this  it had the added bonus of being eligible for AmazonFresh  so it arrived with my veggies and snacks for the week.)  If you re looking for a cost-effective way to supplement the moisturizer you currently use (because it s probably already great  but just needs a little extra help during dry seasons)  I recommend this one!
9535,Lynn,1,10-Nov-17,,I buy most everything through Amazon. This product  however  I saw at store and bought there. I m 50 with combination skin that still gets oily in the T zone  but is dry everywhere else. I used retinol cream  and that dries out my face even more. I didn t expect miracles from the gel  but the results I did get I was pretty impressed with. I wore this cream gel to bed for the first time  I woke up and my face looked plump and fresh  not tired. I decided to go the extra mile and try this product under my makeup. Nothing works under my makeup  as I wear a Bare Minerals type of dry  powder foundation. Surprise  surprise! The gel dried quickly and there was absolutely no streaking or discoloration after I applied foundation and blush. I also noticed that at the end of the day  my makeup maintained  my skin still fresh and dewy  and my normally greasy by then T zone was actually behaving! I d have given this mostureizer 5 stars  but I had to deduct one for the scent. I have allergies  so anything with a fragrance that I apply on my face heads right to my nose. It s a sharp scent  so it s not easily ignored. It does  however  seem to dissipate. I would recommend this product.
9536,WWWF Big,1,19-Mar-18,,For the past 2 & 1/2 yrs I’ve had issues with tiny skin colored bumps & constant large pimples. I’ve spent sooo much money trying to find an affordable solution (masks  serums  moisturizers?almost even went to a dermatologist) & I’ve finally found something that works!  After just 1-2 wks if using it  my skin colored bumps went down. Sometimes I see a few bumps flare up during the day  but overnight they’ll go down again after reapplying. Still dealing with my acne  but they’re not that bad anymore & they rarely get as big as they used to.  I use it in combo with Mario Badescu Drying Lotion. I use the Drying Lotion  after I shower  on any growing pimples then I’ll just do whatever until I go to bed. Wash it off  then out this moisterizer on. My large pimples used to last days  but now they go down 1-2 days.
9537,Bree K.,1,07-Sep-16,One person found this helpful,I pray they never discontinue this product. I have been using it for about 3 months now. I have extremely sensitive combination-oily skin and terrible acne scars all over my cheeks and forehead. I have tried to avoid using moisturizers because most just upset my skin and do more damage than good  even the ones that are supposedly made for acne prone skin. and trust me I have tried sooo many!! A friend of mine recommended this to me recently and I am hooked! This is the only moisturizer that I have ever tried that did not make me break out!! I know it has some alcohol in the ingredients  but I feel that it has not affected my skin whatsoever and compared to all other moisturizers this has improved my skin s over all tone  faded scarring  made those weird tiny acne bumps go away  and it just gives me a really nice natural glow. Wish it had some spf but i prefer the spritz kind anyways so its not a dealbreaker for me personally. When I put it on I softly massage it on my skin  it is very refreshing and the cucumber smell is really nice. (The scent has never irritated my skin either or burned..obviously do not put any products too close to your eyes) I loooove this moisturizer it has saved my skin and changed my life honestly lol..It is just so nice to be able to go out in public without feeling like I have to wear foundation to appear presentable. I seriously recommend this stuff especially if you are struggling with adult acne or if youre in that weird phase of having to choose between anti-acne/oil or anti-aging.  My one and only con: i wish it had a pump! just to be a bit more sanitary.. jars are cute  but so old school..its still worth a shot for the price though..just always make sure to apply this with squeaky clean hands to a squeaky clean face.
9538,Erin Beakley,0,01-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,Bought elsewhere but was so disappointed I had to share. The first time I used it it burned a little  like a tingle. I figured it was because I had just exfoliated and moved on. The next and the next and the next it still burned. It never occurred to me there would be alcohol in a moisturizer. There s no point in a moisturizer with an astringent in it. Totally love garnier  but this is a total miss.
9539,A.M. Ken,1,20-May-18,2 people found this helpful,Used this because I wanted to save money and not drop 40 dollars on a moisturizer that I love. It was pretty good  and you get a lot of product for the price. My issue with it is that it smelled awful  like old lady perfume and a rotten grapefruit. Every time I put it on my face I was welcomed to the  wonderful  scent. It did it s job other than that. Wouldn t use again unless it s an emergency because my skin feels a lot better and softer since I switched back to the other moisturizer. I think it s from silicone but I m not an expert.
9540,Brittany,1,28-Jun-19,One person found this helpful,This moisturizer is amazing for sensitive combination skin like mine!! I put just a little dab of this stuff on after cleansing my face and it leaves my skin soft and hydrated and doesn t break me out  unlike other moisturizers. Must-have product for me!
9541,Alise W,1,16-Apr-18,,So I bought this on a vacation a few months ago because I forgot my normal moisturizer  and at first I didn’t like it because it didn’t seem to do anything. Then one night I accidentally put on too much and had to rub it in for 30ish seconds. I woke up the next morning and my skin was soooooooo soft. Since that night  I have been applying it liberally and my skin still feels soft. The only downside is that it has a pretty strong scent... that’s not a problem for me  but it might be for other people. I would buy this again  it’s great for the price! Just remember to apply a lot of it
9542,Dan,1,10-Aug-18,,I fell in love with gel moisturizers after using Baebody eye gel as a regular moisturizer. They don t break me out like other moisturizers. I found this one and thought I would give it a try and I like it even more than Baebody! I have not tried the blue version of this product even though it has better reviews  because I love this one so much and am nervous to try anything else. I ran out of this a few days ago and I am already not loving my skin as much using my back up moisturizer  so I m glad this comes in a two pack now! If you have sensitive skin  give this a try =)
9543,Silvana Dascenzo,1,02-Apr-15,,It s a good  reliable moisturizer that does what it s supposed to: lock the moisture into your skin. I have a combo skin so the choice was easy  as it s light  absorbs quickly and doesn t leave any residue or stickiness. The price was also very attractive as I prefer a simple  refreshing moisturizer over a fancy expensive one. The reason is because I read in an article that we don t really need one of those expensive ones with lots of active ingredients as the moisturizer doesn t penetrate deep into the skin  it stays on the surface to keep the moisture in. And we re better off spending the money on a good serum instead  with lots of goodies in it. Then use a light moisturizer to lock it in. I also like the fact that it s a gel formula  can t get more lightweight than that. I personally am very pleased with it  so I put it on subscription. I can t see why anybody would dislike it  other than expecting miracles out of a light moisturizer....like making wrinkles disappear- that s never gonna happen. It s not what it s made for.
9544,newcoatsofpaint,1,28-Nov-16,,Didn t buy from Amazon but rather at a drug store in a pinch after forgetting my regular moisturiser at home before a trip. I LOVE this. The smell is fragrant but it s not bad  and more importantly it keeps my oily skin soft and matte all day long. Not sticky! I find it also helps my makeup sit well on my face throughout the day. I usually have to reapply powder half way through the day  but not anymore. That being said  it doesn t feel dry but you won t have the same super wet feeling you d get from using a CeraVe or Cetaphil daily moisturizer. It s a different kind of moisturizer  but I ll definitely be buying again! It s so nice to find something that works so well on my combination skin. <3!
9545,Jennifer,1,04-Jun-19,One person found this helpful,I ve have EXTREMELY dry  flaky and sensitive skin since I had my daughter. I ve purchased more brands of moisturizers than I can even count trying to find one that hydrates my skin and doesnt burn and it has been a MAJOR challenge untill I found this. IT IS AMAZING! And a very little of the product goes a VERY long way! If you re debating to purchase or not.. BUY IT! You will be SOOO happy you did!
9546,Jenni & Mike Jordan,1,21-Nov-16,,I have been trying out different moisturizers. A lot tend to either give me a little whitehead or two. I am moving towards the more gel-like consistencies now and this one was lovely! I like that it seems to absorb pretty quickly on top of my serum  and doesn t leave a sticky or tacky feel after a few minutes. But my skin really does feel moisturized. This was one of the first moisturizers that didn t leave me greasy looking in the morning. My demi-matte make up applies beautifully on top of it. The scentnis very light and refreshing  and dissipates quickly. Overall  a great value for a light moisturizer.
9547,Rosedina Petit Homme,0,25-May-19,,My issue with this product isn t that its not moisturizing because it is  its not magic but for a cheap price it s moisturizing. Although this broke me out sooooooooo badly. My skin is a bit sensitive but not that sensitive. It may be due to fragrance but it has never broken me out to this extent with other products. While my skin has never been super clear before using this product it was at one I m of its best and I m so disappointed I decided use this product. Please beware. The fragrance is nice but way too much for the skin.
9548,L.H.,1,05-Sep-16,,Gel moisturizers are supposed to be great for all kinds of skin so I figured I would check this one out. My skin is normally dry most of the year and oily in the summer so I figured this would be the right product in the line. First off  it s definitely a gel texture and took some getting used to versus the creams I normally use but after blotting a thin layer over my skin and letting it set  my face felt moisturized but not oily/greasy. I like that it s light weight and relaxing but I do wish that it were a bit more moisturizing for when I use pore serums that tend to dry me out. All in all  it s a great product that I m sure I will keep purchasing.
9549,Amy Gurley,1,05-Feb-14,,I really like this stuff. I have mostly normal skin except for my forehead where it gets really dry and flaky. Regular lotions don t last and I wanted something better. When I opened the canister I was a bit put off by the fact that it was way more  gel  than  cream  and I thought  well how is this going to moisturize my face?  but it really does. I would suggest  however  to exfoliate if at all possible prior to use. The first time I used it  I just rubbed it on without cleaning my skin and it barely worked  if at all. I was disappointed. And then I thought well  I obviously have a lot of dead skin on my forehead  lets clean that off first. And now it works wonderfully. I m writing this review in mid-winter  and on days where it s cold but wet  my skin is good with every 48 hours. But when it drops below 30 and it s dry  I have to go every 24 or so. It dries quickly  leaves no residue or  oily  feeling  and makes my skin feel supple and soft afterwards. I love it!
9550,SMG,0,21-May-14,,I wanted a moisturizer that I could apply before I put on my foundation which would hydrate my skin and help blend in makeup. Never having tried this before  I bought it at a local store due to the glowing reviews and was excited to try it out. Unlike most moisturizers  this one is a gel as opposed to cream. I washed my face and applied it to my face. I found that it spread easily on skin  however dried a minute or so after putting it on. My skin felt tight and not soft or hydrated. In my experience  not only was this an ineffective product to use before adding makeup for easier blending  but it also just overall fell short in replenishing and hydrating skin. I used the entire jar and saw no changes in it s effects. I found another product that I love that I will be using from now on.  The only thing I liked about this gel was that during the four weeks or so I used it  it did not break me out.
9551,A. Landers,1,07-Jan-12,,I was hesitant to buy such a cheap product  especially since I have not liked other Garnier products in the past. After reading so many positive reviews I gave it a try. This is a wonderful gel to use at night; it keeps my skin healthy and it doesn t clog a single pore. I can t use most creams because they give me those little white bumps around my eyes  called Milia  plus an overall general breakout. Zero irritation here  no burning or bumps  it s just effective. And one little jar has lasted me for awhile. The UV cream version of this is wonderful for the daytime  and together they have become beauty staples for me. Before these products I couldn t find an moisturizer that worked for me  but even oily skin needs moisture.  I m 35 and I still get acne (my parents used to steal my Clearasil when I was a teenager  so I figured it would happen to me  too). For those that know my pain  it is difficult to stay acne free while we begin to fight the signs of aging. Although it is not labeled as an anti aging product  use this regularly and you ll find an overall difference in your skin texture. The first night I put it on I wondered if it would be effective enough  but give it a few nights and your skin will feel healthier and more youthful overall.
9552,PrettyRed,1,27-Jul-13,,I bought this at my local grocery store after reading the reviews on amazon. This stuff is the best. It leaves my skin feeling so hydrated. Plus alittle goes a real long way. I started using it about two months ago and I see drastic change in my face. I use it every night and when I put it on it sooths my skin almost because it is so cool feeling. It smells wonderful too. I love how it makes my face look like a glow as if I m so happy. Probably because my skin is happy. I can honestly say when I wake up in the morning I have no pimples and my skin is not greasy or oily.... When you sleep you loose so much water but this balances everything out. I only use it sometimes during the day  but I don t prefer wearing it during the day just because I don t wear makeup and I don t want to over use it plus I m satisfied with how much it works at night time to where I think it makes a differnce during the day. Plus the stuff I use to wash my face keeps my face good through the day. I recommend people to buy this.
9553,Beautyproductfirefly,1,27-May-13,,I have tried so many costly serums  cremes and the list goes on to get rid of my dry  dull looking mature skin. Finally this is the product  My daughter uses the Garnier day lotion with SPF   love the smell on it and the texture and use it on occassions   then I saw this for this amazing price on Amazon and ordered it.  Anyway you apply this  is it an amazing product. I can use it under my make up  and it eliminates the PRIMER (I use cinema secrets foundation highly recommend it  for mature  dry skin   acne adult prone skin   anyone who needs buildable coverage or just a little make up  it is so versitile  but being a creme foundation it needs a good moisturizing base) and the garnier moisture resuce gel is amazing!  It feels nice fresh  and being a gel it is NOT sticky at all. A little goes such a long way !  After using it as base of my make up ( at times I use a bit of hyaluronic acid  awesome product !under it)   and when finished ( if you want to try the cinema secrets foundation  or actually any other foundation  even liquid  give it a try and us a 1 dollar elf brush(Target) and lightly buff the foundation in.  I am not sure how it works but the garnier gel cream brings out the best in my make up. I do have acne scars and yet with the combination of these products and able to apply the products for a natural look yet very nice flawless coverage !  To freshen up   put a little of the gel cream in a little tiny pot you can carry in your purse and refresh your look - I only use a couple dabs  use very little at first to see how it works with your foundation  especially if you are using a liquid one  and it will just give you a nice fresh look.  You know the kind you see on some ladies in their 60th or older that seem to still have a nice fresh look on their cheeks  I think I found out their secret:) Garnier Moisture rescue Gel Cream  Highly recommend this product especially for under $ 7!!!  I finally found my HG in a primer  moisturizer!
9554,J. Carroll,1,21-Feb-13,3 people found this helpful,I ve been using this for three years. I m 23 yrs old and I started noticing little lines around my eyes since I started wearing makeup. I knew I needed to do something. This is full of hydration! It looks like you see on the packaging  like a mint green colored gel thats goes on the face very smooth and even. You dont have to even use a lot  just use your finger tip to dab a bit on and it covers the whole face. I have sensitive/combination skin and this gel cream is cooling  fast absorbing without leaving residue or streaks and great at soothing skin around the eyes. The smell is very light like cucumber/dew melonish. This is my only moisturizer for morning/night and for $7(at walmart) it s as good as the $100 stuff. You won t be dissapointed.
9555,indranee,1,27-Jun-15,,I just bought this after having used the green one for the past two weeks. I have dry-combo skin with a slight T-zone-y feel. The green one was great but I bought this because I can t find that one in the nearest Rite Aid and I was in a hurry (ran out of the other one). I ll write another review later next month but so far I concur with all the good reviews. This feels light and airy and is so  so easy to apply. It goes on light and spreads fast without a sticky feel. My only concerns would be 1) the fragrance (what s in it)  2) the small container -- I wish Garnier would make a bigger container for these two creams... paying a bit more is fine  3) no SPF at all  and 4) the TYPE of container. I hate having to dip my fingers into the bottle. And at least ONE of the containers in the store seemed to have been opened and tested by other customers  making me have to hunt for what seemed like unopened containers. Luckily  I found one. Garnier  please put these in pump bottles if you can. Thanks!
9556,Live_Aloha,1,11-Feb-14,3 people found this helpful,I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer given why I have been using it for past 5 years. It s of a gel texture hence it s extremely lightweight and absorbs super duper fast. I like to use it in the mornings when I wash my face and before applying makeup. It sort of even acts out as a primer with mineral makeup. Love the scent  the texture and how it does not break out my skin. Mind you I have a oily skin which dries out very fast when I wash it. This jar also lasts me for two months or so when I use it daily in the mornings. Definitely something that has lasted a very very long time on my skin care shelf :)
9557,Celia,1,18-Mar-19,,I have an oily t-zone and patches of dry skin. This moisturizes my dry patches AND makes my t-zone less oily. my pores are still visible but less so than with many other moisturizers .. how how you do dat Garnier?! It’s not as good as Tatcha Water Cream but it’s the next best thing and comes d***m close and for the price ????????
9558,Stevie,1,22-Sep-18,,Have been using this for years .My skin drinks it up. Adds moisture and feels great. I do not notice the odor that others have talked about. It pairs well with Tretinoin  Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C... Don t put these all on your face at the same time....Just sayin it works very well when combined with these products.
9559,gfdfg,1,25-Dec-18,,I like this light gel that provides moisture for my oily skin without clogging the pores. It has a light scent that is not too overpowering  although I would prefer without the fragrance. I use it under my sun block every morning and have bought it repeatedly on Amazon due to it s reasonable price.
9560,Kittie,1,24-May-14,98 people found this helpful,This gel is great. I got it from CVS on sale at 5.99 (I thought for that price you really cant lose)  and it turned out to be a really good product. The only problem with it is that its is a little too heavily perfumed that is my ONLY drawback that I can see. I use this in the morning along with?NuNutrients Vitamin C Serum - Anti-Aging Serum?(specifically for around my eyes  which I highly  highly recommend)  and i can literally see 5-10 years vanish from my face. I would also recommend getting a cleanser that you can use to exfoliate as well. If you do that you will see lines around your lips  and eyes just disappear.
9561,Veronica,0,14-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,DO NOT RECCOMEND TO PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN.  I was really looking forward to using this product as part of my regular skin routine.
9562,Liz,1,10-Mar-15,6 people found this helpful,I don t usually write reviews for products  but holy softness  Batman!!!!!! I m a 20 year old female  and I have acne on my cheeks/jaw and oily skin everywhere else. I have never used a moisturizer for my face before because I was only ever focused on getting rid of my acne. So  I decided to buy this (along with Garnier s Blackhead Eliminating Scrub). I cannot attest to the scrub yet because I just started it today.  But holy cannolis on rye!!!!!!!! This moisturizer makes my skin feel extremely soft. Like BAM BAM! In yo  face! Literally! It does so without making your face feel like you took a bath in 50 cheeseburgers.  Being a girl with acne  to have face products that don t contribute to the red devil on my face are a must. And having the product make my skin feel like a hundred bucks (c mon a million would be overselling it just a bit  for that you d need like a giant diamond to rub your face with. Because when you re rich  that s all you do)  is a giant plus like the Swiss flag!  But don t take my word for it. Try it yourself! Thankfully  it isn t that expensive. So even ramen-eating college kids  or really anyone that eats ramen for almost every meal (which clearly isn t me *nervous laugh*)  can afford it! Barely. I m just kidding. Seriously  this stuff is fantastic!  I mean  it s totally up to you. You don t HAVE to have soft skin. But if you want it  this is your product.
9563,jessica,1,27-May-19,,I love this gel face cream i use the pink one as i have extra dry skin that flakes up at the corners of my nose  disgusting! I always get the dry skin version and i lovvvveeee it  i will throw a fit if they ever stop making this!!
9564,The Escape Artist,1,20-Nov-13,3 people found this helpful,I used this during the summer months and I felt it provided decent moisture. The grape scent is fairly strong at first  but wears off quickly. This isn t a miracle cream or anything like that  and if your skin is extremely dry then you re better off using something else (like me now that it s winter). But it works for a quick boost of moisture  AND it s rated well on goodguide-dot-com (a major plus in my book).  By no means is this a replacement for Clinique Moisture Surge  but it s a good fake-out for a fraction of the price!
9565,Molly,1,20-Aug-12,3 people found this helpful,My skin is very  combination - sometimes regular lotion still leaves me skin feeling dry  but throughout the day I can get greasy and need to use pressed powder. This is by far the best moisturizer I ve ever used. I picked it up randomly when I ran out of my last moisturizer  and I was skeptical when I got home and opened up the package to find that it actually is a gel- it doesn t look anything like lotion. It works SO. DARN. WELL. After the first time I used it I was really impressed with how it absorbed into my skin and made my skin feel really really soft but not greasy or like I d used moisturizer. After using it for several days  I ve noticed that my skin is more even during the day- I feel like my skin is actually producing less oil while still feeling soft and moisturized. Also  I like that it doesn t take much. I can already tell the jar will last a long time.
9566,E. Constable,1,11-Oct-17,,My favorite moisture gel. I have used this for several years and love the feel of it. It s refreshing & cooling but no SPF ( I think they now have a formula that has it added) . I m 68 and always have people compliment on my great skin. Honestly   I ve used all the name brands over the years and I like this one probably the most for regular daily use.
9567,shelby cupp,1,21-Mar-19,,I have dry/normal skin and god I wish I started using this when I was a teenager!!! It s lightweight and dries instantly! While most moisturizers make me breakout this one never does! I hope they never discontinue this product! It s the major consistent to my beauty routine and it should be yours as well!!!
9568,A. Fink,1,04-Oct-17,,I bought the Neutrogena moisturizer with hyalauranic acid  it is usually $15-$17. This is JUST as good and so much cheaper! I have a very oily acne prone face. Due to my acne products I can have burning and irritation. This gives my skin moisture  is soothing  and soaks right into my skin.
9569,BeautyTipsForBrokeGirls,1,06-Apr-17,,I prefer Clean and Clear morning burst to this product. This is a very light gel. It s almost weightless but it s not enough moisture for my skin. I have to layer with other products to get good moisture. I will try out the pink version next. However  I m planning on using this during the daytime on hot summer days. Will be perfect then (just not good for fall/winter when skin is driest).
9570,Rayne,1,21-Jul-13,,i actually bought this from target. i was never the type to use moisturizers  didnt really think i needed them back then  but as of the past few years my skins become really dry  and even after washing my face  even with a scrub  my skin was STILL looking flaky and dry  so my makeup always looked like crap and i couldnt figure out why. i switched the the neutrogena face wash  just the standard orange in a pump bottle  and though it works awesome  afterwards  my face is suuuper tight and dry. and thats where this little product comes in.  it smells great  very fresh  clean and crisp scent but also very light. and speaking of light  a little bit of this stuff goes a looong way. i was surprised by its texture really. i was expecting an actual cream  like your typical lotion stuff and i saw this green stuff and touched it and it felt really good lol. its cold  slick and not oily at all. that was one thing that concerned me but nope  i put a little on my wrist  rubbed it in a little and once it dried it was just smooth and soft  no oily residue.  i came on here because i was like  oh this stuffs awesome  and i wondered how others who bought it felt about it so i thought a good place would be to check amazon for other peoples comments  and was not surprised to see how highly everyone else spoke of it  so i had to put my word in too because im totally in love with this stuff..  i wondered if anyone knows of any of those good little face scrubber things? like the Wave or just something good that scrubs the face  a little battery powered one. or a microdermabrasion thing. i really want to try one of those. i am in my mid 20 s and still get some bad breakouts  and i just don t know what to do anymore.there s rarely ever a time my face is ever 100% clear  and by the time it does  i break out again a week before that time of the month and it takes weeks to heal. any advice is totally welcome and appreciated.
9571,Amazon Customer,0,31-Dec-16,,Have a sensitive but combo skin that gets dry through the night. This cream has a great texture and smell. It is rapidly absorbed by the skin. No greasy feeling. However  it did not do what it promised for me. Saw no noticeable difference after two weeks. Also got some breakouts overnight after few days using it. Probably better for normal skin that are not prone to breakouts.
9572,Jean Bean,1,04-Jun-15,,This gel moisturizer is perfect for oily/combination skin. It goes on nice and cool and absorbs in completely and pretty quickly. It sinks in deep into the skin and your face stays hydrated most of the day. In my opinion  this version has more staying power than the normal (green version) of the same. Don t be fooled by the  for dry skin  label- this oil free moisturizer is great for oily skin too. I have oily skin and some of the products I use to fight break-outs can dry out my skin  so I tried this and have re-purchased this several times. It has a light  fresh scent and is a great alternative to a much more expensive Olay Fresh Dew Over. I highly recomend trying this out. If you happen to find my review helpful please feel free to click that little button. Thank you! PS. This is also great all year round and in the summer time once this sinks in it will not  sweat out .
9573,Amazon Customer,0,18-Aug-17,,The gel seems to be too liquidy than i would like. I would prefer a thicker texture. It took a while for the gel to dry. I don t feel any different afterward. The instruction said to apply twice a day. So  I guess it was designed not to last too long. I decided to purchase this product because the color and the description lead me to think that it would be closer to the Moisture Surge from Clique. I was very disappointed that it wasn t any where close to what I thought. I wouldn t recommend it to anyone.
9574,C. Pack,1,26-Nov-11,One person found this helpful,Years ago I used a Loreal moisturizer that was very similar to this one. To my dismay it was discontinued. I never found a perfect alternative until I stumbled upon this Garnier product. It is perfect. I can t use many things because my face is oily and many moisturizers tend to add to the problem. Even with oil-free lotions  they tend to add to my trouble and leave my make-up looking shiny and oily before lunchtime even comes. This is a great product for those with the same trouble. It s gel based formula is absorbed into the skin nicely  make-up applies smoothly and evenly and looks great all day. I don t even use an additional eye gel  this is sensitive enough for the entire face!
9575,LZX,1,29-May-19,,It works great except it leaves my skin oily until the next time I wash my face. I love how it leaves the skin feeling really fresh and smooth though.
9576,SLB,1,22-May-17,,I bought this on sale (via amazon  of course) & it was a great value. It s the perfect moisturizer for summer - lightweight  will not cause breakouts  & is effective. I am 45 & it does a great job each night keeping my skin refreshed  moisturized  & feeling good!
9577,Ashley Kovaleski,1,06-Apr-19,,I am in love! This moisturizer is amazing. So soothing to the skin. Leaves skin supple and refreshed. Smells great. Light fruity scent.
9578,Bellisima,1,13-Jul-15,,I bought this at Target for $5.99. I normally use the dry skin formula but they were sold out. I tried normal/combo skin formula and i love this one better. It has a tingly feeling once you apply it. I like the scent.it s so clean and fresh smelling. The gel formula is light weight and oil free. I can t ask for anything more. I have extremely sensitive skin and this does not irritate my eczema. Great purchase and product.

9580,Jess,1,15-Feb-14,3 people found this helpful,Okay  I just bought this yesterday at walmart. And already I am in LOVE with it. I had just started using a new foundation that completely dried my face out and I was flaky everywhere. I panicked because yesterday was valentines day and my boyfriend was taking me somewhere nice and my moisturizers weren t working. I ran to walmart and saw this and tried it out. Within 10 minutes of putting it on  my skin was completely back to normal. No flakes  no dryness. My skin looked radiant. Now  I have acne prone skin and currently have a few blemishes. When I woke up this morning  my blemishes were faded and almost gone?! I know this product isn t supposed to clear acne  but so far  it has for me. I love this so much and I d recommend to this anyone with dry skin like mine.
9581,Amazon Customer,1,19-May-19,,Absolutely love this product. I have been religiously using Neutrogena’s hydro boost moisturizer  but for twenty bucks a pop  it wasn’t hitting my wallet well. This product is comparable  if not better than  Neutrogena’s hydro boost moisturizer. Thank you Garnier for making incredible products!!! I also use Garnier’s rose water spray religiously. Definitely worth it!
9582,katrinalynn215,1,27-Feb-18,,This is a great moisturizer for combination/ oily skin! It provides a light hydration without being greasy and from my experience  it doesn’t clog the pores. It works fantastic under makeup and keeps my skin smooth all day!
9583,Yoselin,1,12-Apr-17,,It doesn t do anything else but that: refreshing. It s definitely for oily skin (my type) because once you put it on it absorbs really quick and your face feels very matte. As for moisture ... I m not quite sure if it s enough  but again  it s specifically for oily skin so I guess is ok.
9584,Debbie NYC,1,10-Jan-14,One person found this helpful,I have Dry skin and my face had alot of acne cause other than being in the sun alot and with work and sweat nothing wasn t working on my face. The smell is very delish and it has a very light texture to it. Just a little dab with my finger and massage it into my face. within days i can see my face clearing up the touch of it to my skin feels like moisture bursting without that oily feel which i love. If you have facial skin problem this is one of the best i ever used.
9585,Indianrecipe4u,1,04-Jun-14,5 people found this helpful,I am an Asian with a slightly oily skin. I have so far used different moisturizers and creams respective to the seasons.. summers and in winters. But was never satisfied with any of them until today. A very little time after the application of these creams  my skin turns out greasy and oily.. specially in summers. I used to hate them. But can not avoid applying moisturizer since that would leave my skin dull and pale..! I found this Garnier moisture rescue gel-cream at Walgreens recently. Looking at  Oil-free  on the package  I thought I should give it a try. After all  I needed something like this.. a cream which is non oily(since I have a oily skin) and yet  moisturizes my skin. For the first time in my life  I really got that relief of having a smooth and soft skin. Best best best one for the oily skin types. Please go for it without a second thought! I strongly recommend this to all those who have oily skin. For dry skin types  this may not work as they need more oils and moisture.. this is just my opinion. I am just loving this product!
9586,Kenzi Yeager,1,24-Jun-19,,I have dry/combination skin. The pink one is great  not at all sticky and it dries FAST. I use it every morning under my makeup. I can’t use the lotion style moisturizers because they’re greasy and make me break out so this product is a godsend. HOWEVER  the green one gives my skin chemical burns. Everyone’s skin is different  so you just have to experiment.
9587,V,0,26-Oct-16,2 people found this helpful,Too harsh  burns my skin and doesn t moisturize at all. But the consistency is a nice gel like what i was looking for. Also has alcohol in it.
9588,W. Zoucha,0,16-Sep-17,,I don t like the smell of this product. To me it is like a combination of bug spray and flowery perfume. So gross. I also find this product to be too thin to comfortably get out of the jar. It would be much more user friendly in a pump or squeeze bottle. On top of those things I find the moisturizing quality to be okay and it did not cause any reactions for my sensitive skin.
9589,Elizabeth,1,03-May-17,,This is my go to moisturizer especially when my skin is acting crazy. I have combo skin and this moisturizer absorbs well and does not leave me oily or clog my pores. I use many different high end products and this is better then many I have tried.
9590,Laura,1,24-Jul-14,,I decided to try this moisturizer after getting sick of my old one. I had been using an Origins moisturizer but it wasn t enough for my very dry skin and I felt it was pretty pricey at almost $30. I have been using Garnier Skincare Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream for about a week and I really like it. I have very sensitive skin and most products make me break out but this one hasn t which is impressive. I like that it is a little on the thicker side so I only need to put it on once and my dry skin stays moisturized for the whole day. The downsides  I dislike that this is an  Add on  item  I don t want to have to pay X amount of money to be able to purchase this. I ended up buying it at a local CVS for the same price as advertised on Amazon. Second downside  it tends to make my skin shiny. Not oily  but shiny. I m sure this will be minimized with makeup on.  Overall  I really like this moisturizer and will continue to use it.
9591,Kassandra Dosal,0,17-Apr-14,,I have oily skin with adult acne at age 30. I liked this product when I first applied it  but once it dried it seemed not to moisturize at all. In fact it made my skin look drier. I will stick to my pricier but favorite moisturizer for oily/clogged skin; sonya dakar natureluxe clear lotion. Its 70 bucks but lasts 3 months  moisturizes and beautifies my skin without breaking me out  and gives me added deweyness without being oily.
9592,Sarah C.,1,25-Apr-15,,Probably the best moisturizer I ve ever used. Goes on smooth and light  dries quickly  and is not at all sticky or greasy or oily. Heals pretty severe dryness that I get with changing seasons or over-washing  in just a day or two of use. Doesn t block my pores at all either. A little goes a long way but if you get too much you can just spread it onto another dry part and it disappears.
9593,Honey,1,20-Feb-14,,I have ordered this product seeing good ratings and reviews :) and yeah I am happy with it. Mine is damn sensitive and combo skin..due to severe winter I had to use this and this one seriously rescued my skin..i nvr completed any cream i buy one cream...use it till i buy a new one or other one..but nvr finished it..due to some dissatisfaction... recently we went to NY  roamed badly in freezing snow..i got red rashes..i was feeling terrible..then i jus gave a chance and applied this cream (large amount on those areas) and slept...wen i got up...my face was clear and free...I gave only 4 bcoz..i m brown skinned..after using this..i look lil tanned..but if u apply any other cream on top of it..that wud be fine... I highly recommend it :) I love it :)
9594,Emily,1,21-Oct-10,2 people found this helpful,First let me say that I have normal skin that is very fair and nearly flawless to begin with  however  I d like to keep it that way for as long as possible! I bought this product because I had received a sample in the mail and instantly loved it!! It absorbs so quickly and is so light and literally  refreshing ! Your skin feels amazing  it looks amazing and the light fragrance just seems to complete it. I got mine at Wal-Mart for under $7 I believe. I use this before going to bed and when I wake up I use it under the Moisture rescue lotion with SPF in it (which is also a great product). I hope this stuff stays with us for a very long time  but I m stocking up just in case! Would ABSOLUTLEY recommend this to everyone!
9595,Bijou9,0,19-Feb-15,,I normally have adult acne/combination skin and had been using the Clinique moisture surge gel and it was amazing!!!!! However  when I started to run low I purchased this product and let me tell you it FAILS to moisturizer after about 10min! I m so disappointed! Time to go back to the department store to stock up on Clinique moisture surge (it s in a pink container)
9596,LKE,1,23-Mar-18,,I bought this product because I have oily skin  even though it says it’s for dry skin. (Its oil free.) I don’t think this would be a good product for someone with actually dry skin. It feels nice in my skin  not heavy or oily at all. Goes well under makeup. I think I like it for daytime use only  but probably want to get something different for nighttime use.
9597,mcg1976,1,17-Oct-13,3 people found this helpful,I have tried so many differents and expensives brands for my facial care. And I have to tell you this Garnier Skincare Moisture Gel is as good as many of them at a really fair Price. I have in my 30 s acne prone skin but dry in some areas  so i was looking for something that could balance my problem. My skin feels moisturized all day long without breaking me out. And you perceive a refreshing sensation after the application. It doesn t leave your skin feeling greasy and as it absorbs quickly you can use make-up inmediatly. I will try other products from this line.
9598,Amye Powell,1,24-Apr-17,,I have really dry skin and this works so well that my face and neck feel refreshed  smooth  and soft. Not oily at all. I m a walking advertisement for this product. lol I tell everyone I come in contact about it. I should get mine free. Just kidding. Seriously  you gotta try it.
9599,Heather,1,19-Oct-17,,I like this a lot  but I question how good this is compared to lotion. Lotion started making me oily and this does not  but I hope I m taking just as good of care of my skin.
9600,GracieS,1,20-May-12,5 people found this helpful,This product has been a lifesaver for my VERY sensitive skin! I have combination oily/dry/sensitive skin. I was having trouble with very dry skin and went through numerous moisturizers  all of which caused redness and irritation if not full breakouts. Using this moisturizer after the Olay regenerating serum (fragrance free) twice a day  after just two months my skin is clear and soft  with a noticeable decrease in redness and blotchiness. As a bonus  it has a very nice smell -- very cucumber-y and refreshing  not flowery or overpowering. It is NOT a lotion  so you don t get any of that lotion residue. Even my husband has borrowed it a few times for dry skin  because you can t see it at all. My only note would be this does not contain an SPF (which is fine with me because I ve found the SPF ingredients usually cause breakouts for me). This gel-cream is a winner!
9601,Stacey M,1,28-Jan-19,,Love how it feels. First time gel user. I think it did it’s job  but due to dehydration  it didn’t provide enough moisture. Yes  I know  I need to drink more water.
9602,JMD,1,06-May-19,,I ve used both. They re all but identical. The Garnier is much cheaper  so I go with it. One of the not-so-secret secrets of cosmetics is that quality and effectiveness often have very little to do with cost. It s marketing and price points  folks. Not news and not rocket science  right?
9603,Marina,1,31-May-18,,My favorite moisturizer! Was looking to switch from a cream based moisturizer because I heard gel-based are better for oily skin. Even though its says for combo to normal skin  it works great for me. Lightweight and leaves your skin feeling refreshed!
9604,NorthEasternBelle,0,20-Aug-17,,Green - I do not care for this; artificial dyes- not good. It seemed to work okay on the skin  but I accidentally got some on my lip and it stung for a few minutes. What the heck?
9605,Tyasia,1,23-Jan-19,,Love this stuff Cheap and does the trick without being too greasy
9606,Peblz,1,28-Dec-17,,Favorite mousturizer for my over 50 skin. I do use it most frequently during the summer months but also rotate with my thicker moisterizers in the winter.
9607,Amy Marona,1,06-May-18,,I have super combination skin with major oily patches and some flaky dry spots. This moisturizer works better than anything I’ve ever tried  and I doubt I’ll switch to something else any time soon. It actually feels like it absorbs into my skin to make it softer over time as opposed to how many moisturizers just feel like they stay on top of your skin. It’s light but powerful and good for all seasons.
9608,Shortcake,1,11-Dec-17,,I can t say that it reduces wrinkles or lines. It is easily absorbed into my skin and my face doesn t feel nasty with it on. It definitely hydrates.
9609,Amanda,1,30-Nov-17,,Can t believe how moisturizing it is and it s a gel. Not greasy like other deep moisturizing lotions. Also comes at a great price!
9610,bibliocath,1,29-Nov-11,,I was a huge fan of Clinique s Moisture Surge  but took it out of my budget 2 years ago when I switched careers. I ve been looking for a gel moisturizer ever since then. This stuff is amazing! My skin is extremely sensitive (I have rosacea on my cheeks which results in red blotchiness and bumps)  dryness from prescription Retin-A  and sometimes oily chin or other problem spots. Other moisturizers (even some formulated for sensitive skin) caused my face to burn and turn hot pink or left me feeling greasy and broke my face out. I ve had neither of these problems six months (and 2 jars) later. Just to clear up any confusion  this is not a cream; it s a gel. Applying it is kind of like applying aloe vera  minus the stickiness. It feels smooth and refreshing on. My (acne-prone) baby sister was immediately sold when I gave her a sample and is now an avid fan. At this price (comparable or less than any major drugstore brand moisturizer)  I think I m going to stock up. If they discontinue this product  I ll be heartbroken.
9611,Valarie,1,25-Jan-18,,This moisturizer smells great. It s a great everyday moisturizer  but I have some dry patches and it did not help with those. The package was smaller than I thought it would be  but this stuff goes a long way.
9612,Sarya,1,30-Aug-17,,Finally found a moisturizer that doesn t make my skin greasy! It s so refreshing  it almost feels like it s part toner. I use this before i apply makeup and at night before bed (if I m not too tired)

9614,Cee,1,11-May-18,,Ive been using this for almost 2 weeks now and a little goes a long way. Its not sticky. Its also not for any blemish remover but it does hydrated my skin. I like the cool feeling for the first couple min. I actually like how its a gel. I bought the 2 for 13$ nd use ut everyday. This may last until august idk.
9615,Mikeysing,1,18-Jun-12,,I have tried many moisturizers to soothe my dry acne prone skin. If you guys have acne prone skin  you ll understand how dry your skin can get after cleansing your face. It got to the point where if I don t apply moisturizer after cleansing I end up looking like a fish sun tanning for hours  My face all flaky and dry and terrible. This Gel-based moiturizer is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used. I highly recommened this production. Bottom-Line  if you suffer dry skin and need something that works? Run to your nearest walmart target or CVS and try it for yourself. You won t regret it.
9616,brooke,1,26-Feb-11,One person found this helpful,i used Mary Kay gel moisturizer in the past  but couldn t afford the $30 price tag. I love this product! I use it daily and even on my dry winter skin. It is so lightweight that I can use it in the morning under my spf moisturizer. It does lock in moisture and makes my skin feel fresh and soft. I love the smell and the price. It is a GEL don t expect anything creamy. I really hope they never discontinue this moisturizer.
9617,Barbie,1,17-Jan-14,,I ve been dealing with some combination skin lately and it looks flaky when I wear makeup but yet it s always oily. I was looking for a moisturizer that wasn t exactly a lotion and I think I ve found it. I was surprised that this was very inexpensive  seeing as though it s garnier. I bought some today and even in just 2 uses  I notice smoother skin already. I ve bought numerous creams  lotions  and cleansers over the past few years and it s always the same. The acne washes dried my face out  and then the lotions made it too oily. You d think it would have balanced out. But this cream-gel isn t greasy  and can be used after you wash with acne cleanser and still leave your skin smooth and silky.
9618,AppleFan,0,04-Sep-16,,This product left my face very greasy looking  felt as I had a film over my face. I won t be purchasing this again. I also didn t notice that one of the main ingredients is Alcohol. Awful.

9620,T.R.H.,1,30-Aug-12,3 people found this helpful,This stuff feels so good when you put it on. It s really cooling and I can t wait to try it after a good workout. I only use this at night because it doesn t keep my skin as matte under makeup as my CereVe AM moisturizer. If it was just a tiny bit more matte on me  i would def. give it 5 stars.
9621,Bellisima,1,28-Jan-15,,I just used this today and i like the gel better than white cream as usual. Something transparent and clear works for me. I love the smell and it feels great on my skin. It cost $8.99 at Wallgreens. Inexpensive and a good moisturizer for my dry sensitive skin.
9622,Amazon Customer,1,02-Nov-17,,I bought this originally for my sunburned face. It helped heal it quickly. I have continued to use it on a daily basis now. I used to have constant break outs and now I hardly have any. LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!

I finally used this stuff on my face today  after cleansing my face---and oh my god WTF is in this stuff!?!?!?!?! My face was burning for some time after I applied it---I couldn t take it  I had to wipe my face with a towel  as of writing this review it s now been about 10 hours-- I just looked in the mirror earlier and noticed my face is significantly RED And my face feels hot without the need to touch it :x--and when I DO touch it  it s freaking hot -.-    This stuff is crap :/ I had high hopes for it--but I will have to look elsewhere. Also if it s worth mentioning I bought this at a local drugstore  Walgreens I believe.

9625,Ashley,0,01-Jan-14,5 people found this helpful,I bought this product hoping it would help with my very dry  flaky skin. For starters  it smells like a heavy perfume. It was extremely overpowering. I used this for a few days  and my skin was actually feeling flakier. I read the ingredients and #3 on the list is denatured alcohol  which explains why it was drying out my skin. This is a waste of money  and I do not recommend it.
9626,Meghan W,1,11-Feb-16,,I have combo skin. Sometimes is oily and sometimes just so dry and flakey. I picked this up  as it was really cheap  and if it didn t work wouldn t  not a huge loss.

It made my face sticky and I woke up with two huge under the surface pimples the next morning :( I have normal/dry skin and I just didn t feel like this entered my skin at all  more like sat on top. Even the next morning the texture of my skin was something I m not used to. I ll try giving to a friend who hopefully has a better experience.

I have several areas on my face that get dry and flaky during the winter months and was using a cream which was greasy and made my face shiny. I decided to give this a try this past winter and it improved the look of my skin. I put it on just once in the morning. I no longer have flaky skin. My only concern is I like to use products with SPF  but this doesn t have. They do have one with SPF in it that is a lotion  so I will try that next. I had doubts about what the gel cream would feel like. But  it is refreshing.
9640,Howard,1,22-Feb-17,,Feels good and smells good but it s a very small portion inside the jar and pretty expensive.
9641,Imani Bynum,1,30-Sep-17,,I really like this product. I love how moisturizing it is and it does a really good job at keeping me from looking shiny  especially on my forehead. I love the gel feeling  very moisturizing and not  mattifying . My face feels soft after using it.

9662,Hannah,0,03-Aug-14,,Tried applying it at night after washing my face. It felt very greasy and had a VERY strong fragrance. A couple minutes after applying it my skin started to burn a bit and the scent was too overpowering for me.

9675,sabrina,1,07-Jan-17,,Good so far
9676,Amazon Customer,1,03-Jan-16,,Love this product and the Garnier line.
9677,charady2,1,20-Jan-11,,I get itchy  red rashes from oil of olay sensitive  so I was worried about whether this would do its job. I love it! Glides on easily  dries fast  and leaves my skin soft-without the itchiness of other moisturizers! No more search for a moisturizer that works AND feels great! Thank you Garnier  for a great product that really does its job!
9678,DR MOUSE,1,24-Jan-13,,cool and comfy...this product is light and makes your skin feel wonderful.have been using this product for a while.really love it
9679,tereonia,1,26-Aug-11,3 people found this helpful,I love this product and I have super oily African American skin. I hate heavy moisturizers and this one is so light weight it is refreshing to my face after I wash my face. I still use a spf 40 that is light weight over it  and it doesn t feel like I m wearing anything. I love the scent and how natural it is. I highly recommend this product. Also I just purchased the eye roller today and I m sure it will be amazing.
9680,Sarah,1,30-Mar-15,,Love this product. Use it almost every night.
9681,Connie,1,09-Apr-15,,I layer this between my skin serum and my cc cream.
9682,MochiCat,1,19-Jan-12,,I love this moisturizer! I had been using a high-end moisturizer ($98 for 2oz) and this works just as good. Picked it up at WalMart for less then Amazon too. I m hooked!
9683,Audrey,0,01-Jan-18,,I have oily acne prone skin and this made my face really dry. I do not believe this cream is moisturizing enough.
9684,Amazon Customer,1,29-Sep-16,,I have oily-dry skin and this product is great for me  it leaves my face super smooth. Since I live in a very hot country the gel consistency moisturices it but it dryes really fast wich is great because is not pasty or oily.
9685,Amazon Customer,1,12-Mar-17,,This product is amazing. I have dry skin and within 2 days of using this it completely hydrated my skin. I find that little goes a long way which is a plus.
9686,Nancy,1,06-Aug-14,,This product sinks into my skin and feels great!
9687,College Gal,0,25-Sep-12,2 people found this helpful,I would definitely not recommend this product  unless maybe you have very oily skin. This gel moisturizer made my skin feel so dry  and I have combination normal-oily skin. At first when I started using it I thought it was great and I didn t need to apply much product  and then over time I had to apply more and more because my skin was getting flaky and dry in the middle of the summer when skin is supposed to be the most oily. I finally realized it was because of this product when I noticed that one of the main ingredients is alcohol (third ingredient)  which is so terrible and drying for your skin among other harmful effects! Skin products should not contain alcohols  PERIOD!
9688,Danielle,1,17-Aug-18,,Goes on smooth  non-sticky
9689,Mrs B.,1,14-Feb-15,,Dries nicely and doesn t dry out the skin.

9692,m. wright,0,17-Feb-16,,I loved this at first!! But I noticed that this caused my forehead to break out in cystic pimples so I unfortunately can t continue use!! If this works for you  that s awesome!! Just did not work for me:(
9693,Liz A.,1,18-Aug-11,,I have never written a review before  but I had to for this product. You only need a little bit to go a long way and the way it feels is incredible. It s very moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft and supple. I have used so many other moisturizers and this is the only one I ve ever loved. I hope they keep it for a long time.
9694,Kristie nguyen,1,11-Sep-17,,Super good moisturizer but doesn t smell that great. Kinda plastic-y?
9695,Natalie,1,18-Jan-11,62 people found this helpful,I picked this up at a local dollar store as a last resort. My skin was very dry from tanning and acne meds  and I was hesitant to use this because normally moisturizers cause me to break out horribly. It s fabulous. It s light-weight and oil free. So glad I found this.
9696,B. Cunningham,1,30-Jan-17,,This is great if you live in a warmer  humid climate and want something light.
9697,qualityBooksForLess,1,20-Aug-17,,good for its price!
9698,Amazon Customer,0,15-Feb-17,,Not really a fan. They used to have a better product  but unfortunately it was discontinued.
9699,ariger,0,23-Sep-13,2 people found this helpful,The product feels very cool to the skin and goes on light  which feels really nice especially if you happen to have sunburn on your face. It also doesn t cause any flare-ups or any sort of acne problems. But it makes your skin feel very greasy and takes a long time to seep in. It makes you look sweaty and oily. I also didn t see much of a difference moisturizing-wise  and for that reason I am giving this 2 stars. Don t get it  it s a waste of money. Also  in my opinion  moisturizers work much better when they are in a cream format as opposed to a gel.
9700,C. Gibbons,1,12-Aug-11,,I m allergic to lots of products so never try new stuff but I got a sample of this either in the mail or in a magazine (somewhere!) and absolutely love it. I use a heavy cream at night and use this during the day (I live in Miami so heavy cream is a nightmare during the day) and it s just perfect.
9701,Jess29,1,06-Jun-13,20 people found this helpful,Ever since my skin changed from dry to combination a few years ago I have been struggling to find the perfect amount of moisture during the spring and summer months. My old faithful cetaphil moisturizer is still perfect during the winter months  but leaves my skin shiny and oily during the warmer climate. For a while I thought that my skin was just out of control until I realized I was not using the right product. This gel cream has done wonders. It is exactly the way that rich hydration should feel- it noticeably enhances my skin s moisture barrier without leaving a film  and it doesn t clog or irritate my ridiculously sensitive skin. I have noticed fewer breakouts as well. I finally feel like I am able to glow instead of shine. My skin has been transformed. Now I am not having to search for over-drying and irritating acne facial wash products. As always  it will not produce those same results for everyone  but it did the trick for me! I hope they do not discontinue this.
9702,Amazon Customer,1,11-Oct-16,,A little goes a long ways and it s really moisturizing. Feels nice on my skin  and it smells good!
9703,Alex,1,09-Jul-12,,Makes my skin feel soft and comfortable. Erases first signs of aging. Hydrates very well. Oil free  won t clog pores. I wish it had SPF  other than that this moisturizer is great!
9704,Scubaduba,1,30-Dec-12,,This product is amazing! i have dry skin and my dermatologist told me i need to keep it hydrated. i tried something from clinque but thought it felt to greasy. this is exactly what they say it is  super refreshing! it makes my skin smoother and i feel refreshed.i use 2x a day
9705,Wendy,1,20-Sep-11,9 people found this helpful,I have never written a review before  but this product is so amazing that I felt compelled to write my first one. I have extremely oily  sensitive  and blemish-prone skin  so it goes without saying that I am weary when it comes to using moisturizers. They have the tendency to make me break out and make my face feel greasy. I purchased the moisture rescue gel cream on a whim and ended up falling in love! It goes on like silk  absorbs quickly  and leaves my skin soft  smooth  and hydrated. Plus  it doesn t make me oily or cause any breakouts! Perfect for sensitive skin. I will never use another moisturizer again! Thank you Garnier for making such an amazing product!
9706,Molly Jane,1,17-Jun-14,,grape seed and vit e are known for anti oxidant properties. I feel like my skin is cleaner and lighter. I love that the dark spots have lightened and my fine lines have decreased. Really good product.

9709,keketang,1,09-Mar-15,,Very good product  very comfortable refreshing  highly recommended!
9710,SeaRizzle,1,05-Dec-11,,I used this today and it s great. Honestly. It feels like I m putting aloe gel on my face  but leaves my skin soft and fresh feeling. It s not oily  which is great  because I have combination skin. I highly recommend this product! :)
9711,Jennifer,1,26-Jul-16,,I love this stuff  been using it for years. It smells good and it s very refreshing to use if your skin gets dried out from a face wash. A tiny bit goes a long way!
9712,Mod,1,09-Apr-12,,I really love this product  nice smell. Leave smooth feeling and never feel dryness  last for all day long. I bought 4 bottles in 5 months. Use it everyday  twice daily. Highly recommended!

9719,schnoodle_dog,0,08-May-11,2 people found this helpful,I used this as a night moisturizer. When I wake up in the morning  my skin feels tight. When I wash my face in the morning  it is like the product is still sitting on my skin.
9720,E. M. Griffith,1,28-Dec-11,57 people found this helpful,I ve just turned 50 and have had sensitive skin for decades. In the last 10 years  I ve tried all sorts of anti-aging creams  lotions and serums  including the most popular and highly rated brands (Olay Regenerist  Roc and more). I ve bought products specifically for sensitive skin as well. One unexpected  side effect  has happened in the past few years--rosacea. It s mild  but noticeable  and when I stopped using any lotions or potions  it began to clear up. HOWEVER... I ve still needed a good moisturizer for everyday use  and have had a terrible time finding one that s mild. I saw this at the drug store and decided for $7.99 it was worth a try. Wow! It s fabulous! The gel absorbs quickly  feels refreshing  moisturizes without stinging  feeling oily or heavy  and is actually calming my easily-irritated skin! After only a few days  the redness is gone. No more wasting money on expensive products that don t work for me; from here on out I ll stick to Garnier Moisture Rescue.
9721,Rose,1,07-Sep-15,23 people found this helpful,I have used this product for almost 5 years  so it is about time I let everyone else know about this magic! Just to give you a background  I am 21 years old with combination skin. When I first started buying this product it was twice as much  so I was relieved when the price came down!  This comes in a jar packaging  which I know turns a lot of people off  but I am sure to always be clean and sanitary with my jar products. I don t think this would work as well in a pump dispensary. I have managed to make the jar work over the last few years  so for me it is truly no big deal. This is my first step in the morning  and my last step at night! And yes  for me this really works well as a night moisturizer! Keep in mind I do use the normal/combo version  so my skin may not need as much moisture as someone with dry skin. This product doesn t have a significant smell and it goes on really easily. It is cold when it first touches your skin  which is such a refreshing feeling (especially if it is the hot/warm months)! This doesn t take a long time to soak into my skin. I definitely think this is a wonderful moisturizer  especially for the price. I can t see myself switching up my moisturizers anytime soon since this works so well for my skin. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with the target skin type (normal to combo). It is just a wonderful moisturizer that truly does it s job. It isn t greasy  but it is very lightweight and feels great on your skin.
9722,Katherine,1,09-Jun-16,22 people found this helpful,I recently moved from a very humid climate to a extremely dry and hot climate. My skin was patchy and scaly. I ve been using this product for 3 days now (morning&evening) and my skin has improved significantly. Only one small patch-and I m sure it will be gone soon!  Also..a small amount goes a long way!
9723,J. McDaniel,1,18-Dec-17,13 people found this helpful,I love this moisturizer. It just melts right in to your skin and drenches it with moisture. There s no noticeable smell and it s a very pleasant feeling  cool gel that melts on skin contact. It s difficult for me to find moisturizers that don t cause breakouts or irritate my sensitive skin... this one is a surefire winner  though! I will totally be using it from now on. :)
9724,Myra,1,15-Oct-18,3 people found this helpful,Jelly moisturizers are pretty common in Asia  so when I used up my moisturizer from Japan  I was worried I wouldn t be able to find anything like it in the US. I was relieved to find this jelly moisturizer on Amazon  and at a relatively affordable price. I bought the Garnier Moisture Rescue Moisturizer for Normal/Combo (green color). I m very happy with my purchase for the following reasons:  JELLY MOISTURIZERS ARE BETTER THAN CREAM-BASED! - Easier even application on face. Because of the watery texture  the jelly glides easily over skin. - Despite the green color in the jar  the product applies clear. I much prefer this than having a white cream on my face. - Faster moisture absorption. I feel like I have to wait longer with cream moisturizers before I can put my makeup on. With jelly  I can apply makeup almost right away.  NICE SUBTLE SMELL. -  Fruit water  is listed as an ingredient on the box. The jelly has a kind of cucumber  spa water smell. It is quite subtle and not overbearing at all. I much prefer this over heavily perfumed moisturizers.  JAR PACKAGING. - I prefer buying makeup products in jars rather than in tubes or pump dispensers because you can maximize the use of a product. With a jar  you can use up every drop of a product. It s much harder to do that with a tube or pump dispenser.
9725,Debi,1,19-Feb-17,19 people found this helpful,I love this stuff! I went to a dermatologist and he told me to wash my face with a face brush and Dove soap then put this product on afterwards. My face has never felt smoother. This is not expensive either.
9726,Cricketoes,1,21-Oct-18,3 people found this helpful,This review is for the Garnier Skinactive Moisturizer Normal/Combo. This is literally my favorite facial moisturizing cream. My face is very sensitive  anything that is too heavy makes me break out and also makes my face sweat excessively. So most everything else I try just is way too heavy for my face. But this is really light and is practically the only moisturizer I can use that doesn t make me break out or make me sweat after applying it. It also does a great job of moisturizing and makes my face feel really soft and fresh. This is not greasy at all. The texture is like a cool gel and a little goes a long way. I rarely use anything else but this. I m a forever user.
9727,carebear in kc,1,09-Oct-16,9 people found this helpful,I love this moisture gel infact I love it so much I use it twice a day once in the morning after a quick facial wipe cleanse then again after my evening shower before my night moisture mask. My skin is radiant and soft. Highly recommended for most any skin type. Nice scent and lightweight. No breakouts since using this either.
9728,Boris,1,18-Dec-16,8 people found this helpful,Bought this hoping it would be like Clinique s moisture surge and I was not disappointed! It does have more of a scent compared to moisture surge  but it is not overwhelming. It goes on smoothly and isn t too heavy. I would buy this lotion again.
9729,Chances Mama,1,01-Mar-16,13 people found this helpful,One of my most favorite moisturizers. As far as it being a general moisturizer it is my favorite. It doesn t contain a lot of targeted anti aging ingredients like I have begun to switch over to because of my age  but for someone who s not ready for anti wrinkle or dark spots etc etc it is the best out there I believe. The consistency can t be beat  it always creates a nice glowing smoothe palette under foundation almost like a primer which was always my favorite thing about it. It dries quickly and the cool gel feels amazing and refreshing. Has a nice light clean smell. I still use this and interchange with my other anti aging products. It is also unbeatable when it comes to really dry skin as with its sister product in the pink jar specially for dryer skin. A little goes a long way and if you ever find yourself flaky from too much sun or chemicals or acne this is amazing for that.
9730,Joan Heguy,1,23-Feb-19,,I have combination skin that’s a bit sensitive. I have tried and loved Clinique’s Moisture Surge. I did not like the price tag tho. I did some research and someone suggested this product  Garnier’s Moisture Rescue for dry skin  and I am impressed. It is almost exactly like the Moisture Surge. I couldn’t say what’s different  exactly. Smell and texture are the same  feels the same going on. Wears the same under makeup. I did not do a side by side comparison as I ran out of the Moisture Surge prior to receiving this. But I highly recommend this product.  For those who haven’t tried Moisture Surge  this product smells great  is cool and soothing going on as it is a gel  and it keeps my face feeling moist all day. It also is great under makeup  and is not greasy. I highly recommend this product!
9731,Lemon,1,27-May-18,One person found this helpful,Finished the jar that I purchased. It has a fresh  light cucumber (?) scent that’s pleasant and not too strong. This pink one is for dry skin  but I didn’t notice any difference from the green one for normal/combo skin that I’ve purchased in the past? it’s the same consistency and I’m pretty sure they’re the same scent  too.  This product is nice if you want something light and non-sticky especially during the warmer months  but won’t be moisturizing enough by itself during the winter time. I would repurchase again in the future  but I want to try different products first!
9732,NatesSweetpea,1,02-May-19,One person found this helpful,I use this moisturizer every morning and I love it! I have sensitive skin with an oily T-zone  so finding a product that works well on my face hasn’t been easy. This however is heavenly! Texture wise it is almost like a clear moose  very soft and cooling  non-greasy  dries instantly and my skin feels and looks nice. I’ve been using this product every morning now for about 9 months and I can’t see that changing. Happy camper here.
9733,Brett G.,1,02-Oct-18,2 people found this helpful,Im a male with sensitive skin that gets irritated skin from most products! My GF had me try some of hers and it worked well with my sensitivity and dry skin so I logged on to my Amazon account and ordered my own! I use it daily and will be definitely ordering more as needed! I highly recommend. Plus its a good price & free shipping for prime members!
9734,mixedcongee,1,02-Jun-19,One person found this helpful,After using tons of moisturizers that wasn t a good fit for my skin  I finally found one that is amazing! I have normal skin... halfway between dry and oily. This moisturizer is great for my skin! It feels cool and lasts a long time. The only thing I wish this product had was an SPF 15 or something on top of its already cool moisturizing properties. Still a 5 star product regardless.
9735,Christy Hodgkins,1,11-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,I love this moisturizer and a little goes a long way. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it is a little tacky when it absorbs  so I was not crazy about that  but it does work well and is very similar to Clinique Moisture Surge. It has a pleasant smell and has a nice cooling effect when you put it on. I have noticed a difference in my skin as I am 53 and I am noticing good results. I love the Garnier products as I also use their shampoo  conditioner so this was a pleasant surprise :)
9736,Lydia in Ohio,1,11-Apr-15,7 people found this helpful,This moisturizing gel is well-named. I have very dry skin  especially in the cold of the Northern Ohio winter. Garnier Skincare Moisture Rescue has become my go-to moisturizer. I find that it is a light moisturizer that doesn t go on feeling thick or heavy as so many moisturizers do. It has a pleasant delicate floral (lily-of-the-valley  I think) scent. Of the different moisturizers I ve tried  this is the one I like best. And it doesn t cost an arm and a leg! I do wish it came in a larger size.
9737,benpatpow,1,21-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,I have been using this for about a week now and I like it a lot! I use it after my shower and it isn’t sticky or anything when it dries  in fact  when it dries it leaves the skin feeling soft. I have noticed that some of my acne scars have lightened up a bit too  so that is a plus! The smell isn’t too bad  I’d say it’s fruity like most garnier hair products would smell but kind of has that mediciny skin product smell to it too? I gave it four stars because it is such a small package and I don’t know how long it’s going to last me  good thing it’s pretty cheap.
9738,Tracey,1,05-Feb-18,2 people found this helpful,This product does what it says it will do. It s been great for my dry skin  and works fine to wear under makeup. The gel formula is nice and light  and feels quite good on the skin  especially first thing in the morning. That said  the  light herbal scent  is strong. It doesn t smell bad  but if you re someone sensitive to any kind of perfumes in your products  this isn t the moisturizer for you.
9739,WMarine,1,15-Jan-19,,I love the way it s not oily at all...it has a very refreshing  light feel that evaporates quickly and doesn t leave my skin with a sticky or oily residue. I noticed that my face was  brighter  and smoother within about 2 days of using the product twice a day. I also like the refreshing scent when I m applying it to my face  also it doesn t sting or burn my eyes like other products. I didn t notice any difference in the color/size of a dark age spot on my cheekbone but I m very satisfied with this product and will continue to purchase it.
9740,Jade,1,29-Dec-17,2 people found this helpful,Good product for the price. Gentle cucumber smell. A thin gel  not a creme or lotion. Soaks right in  I have no issues with my makeup after. My skin is very sensitive and very dry and so far I have not had any adverse side effects. A little goes a long way I usually only need a few dabs to cover my whole face
9741,C. McCay,0,20-Nov-17,2 people found this helpful,Does not soak into skin very well - I found that if I applied before putting on my makeup  once I d spread foundation on my face there were little pills of the moisturizer all over my face where it was just sitting on top of my skin. Also has a not bad  but unusual smell that isn t entirely pleasant. Would not recommend.
9742,LAmom,1,29-May-15,2 people found this helpful,I have oily/combination skin with adult acne that flares with the slightest change to my cleansing routine  so when I needed to find a moisturizer for the summer months  this gel-based Moisture Rescue seemed like a good option. It s so light  it absorbs almost immediately with no shine or greasy residue. It has a slightly sweet pear/cucumber smell that disappears soon after applying. Best of all  it hasn t made my acne worse and is just the right amount of moisturizing for the hot summers. I use a little spatula thing to scoop out a pea-sized amount. That s enough to cover my entire face and neck and the whole thing lasts me about 3-4 months. I say  little  because it s smaller than I expected  about the size of a plum. I am now on my second little tub.
9743,Leia,1,03-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,This is such a soothing gel for wind or sun-damaged skin. I feel pampered when I use it and always wake up with soft  moist skin. . Never burns as many creams do on my sensitive skin. I can even dot it around my eyes. However  I use it only at night as it pills up when I put foundation over it.
9744,Purple Feather,1,03-Dec-15,2 people found this helpful,This is really great moisturizer. I hate using products that I can still feel on my face after applying  and this just absorbs immediately and then is gone. It does have a light fragrance  but it doesn t bother me as much as some of the other reviewers.  My one gripe is that I personally feel that it s a bit too light for the 24hr moisture claim. I put it on in the morning  and by the time I get home from work I m needing another application pretty badly. I might try out the version for dry skin next time. My skin is usually combo  but I have been using a face wash that s a bit drying and that could be the issue.
9745,Holli,1,14-Dec-15,3 people found this helpful,This is my FAVORITE facial moisturizer  and I have tried plenty. This one is better than average because of the consistency of the product. It is a gel and that makes it very light when applied  but it hydrates like a much thicker face cream would! I hate putting greasy moisturizers on right before bed  and this has all the benefits of those without the added oily factor. You won t regret trying this one! I have also put it in the refrigerator for a few hours before using when I used a harsh exfoliant and it felt amazing!
9746,Erin,1,16-Feb-18,One person found this helpful,Great product! Upon first use & applying on just cleansed skin it instantly made my face feel super soft & had a nice glow to it. Takes very little product to cover face & neck  so this will last a bit. The scent is nice  not overwhelming at all & it is a very lightweight gel/cream. Would probably feel even more fabulous if it were put in fridge & then applied! I might just try that.
9747,JESSICA WALTERS,1,20-Dec-17,2 people found this helpful,My favorite moisturizer for oily  dry  and acne prone skin. This keeps my face clear and soft even during cold dry winter months. It s not great for wrinkles or fine lines though  so be sure to use something at night for that.
9748,S.Fox,0,30-Jun-19,,Immediately after opening this jar  I noticed a bad smell  kind of like burnt plastic. I figured that maybe it was just my nose at the time or that it just needed some time to aerate. So I used it for a few days... but the smell never went away. And on top of that  it seemed like it was drying out my skin more than moisturizing it. I ended up throwing it away.
9749,BBE,1,11-May-18,One person found this helpful,This soaks into my skin quickly without feeling heavy or leaving a residue. A little goes a long way and keepse feeling comfortable and confident  without burning or irritating my skin at all. I was worried about wasting money on this if I ended up not liking it  but now I m glad I took the risk.
9750,SJ,1,17-Apr-17,One person found this helpful,I love this. I love that it s a gel and not a sticky cream. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated (with a refreshing cool feeling. Trust me  it s a great feeling). My foundation goes over it seamlessly. I have had many other moisturizers that leave my skin feeling gross and makes my foundation get almost clumpy when I put it on. But this one is perfect. I love this more than any other makeup I own. I really cannot recommend it more.
9751,RVAja,1,09-Jul-14,4 people found this helpful,Have been a big fan of Garnier s products for years  and this is the third jar of the gel cream I ve purchased. Really love the lightweight feel and fresh scent. The product doesn t feel heavy or greasy on your skin  which I find especially important in the summertime. Garnier also makes a green gel cream like this that is for normal skin - the pink is formulated for dry skin  but to be honest I can t tell the difference - I don t think the pink one moisturizes any better - both are great. I have generally dry skin and I find this to be enough to keep wintertime dryness and flakiness at bay.
9752,The PinUp Girl2B,1,18-Mar-18,,This is a knock-off for Clinique s Moisture Surge but it s not bad. I ve used it and especially in the summertime because I have greasy skin in the summer and dry in the winter. It gives you the feeling of your skin drinking this in  it s rich but not greasy  it really moisturizes your skin in those hot summer months and I swear by it as an older woman. It s a good knock-off at an even better price compared to the Clinique product.
9753,Marianne R. Davis,1,14-Aug-18,,I’ve been searching for a moisturizer to protect the delicate skin under my eyes for...well  forever. This gel is perfect because I can put it under my eyes right up to the bottom lash line and it doesn’t irritate my eyes like every other product I’ve ever tried. No stinging  no watery eyes  no more misery! Soon I’m going to risk the SPF version and see if I have the same success.

I had to go back to oil-free makeup and moisturizers and had some really frustrating experiences with oil-free products just not doing the job and drying out my skin. I was so relieved when I stumbled upon this product! It is so light but it really does the job. I use it during the day under my makeup and at night before I go to bed. It really does feel refreshing  to steal from the label. There can be a sticky feeling if you use too much so you have to learn how much you really need for your skin. I don t have to use much at all and the jar has lasted me a long time. It can also give a slight wet feeling (for lack of a better term) when you first apply it but it sets in very quickly and that feeling goes away. I have had much less issues with dry skin since I started using this and it has not irritated my skin at all.
9755,Amazon Customer,0,15-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,Unfortunately this product did not provide much moisture to my skin. I will probably try a type that is extra moisturising to see if it is different. I do like this brand  it was my first gel moisturiser.
9756,LeiaMom76,1,18-Jun-19,,This gel is serving its purpose just perfectly. It’s light enough to wear under foundation and primer  or even as a primer itself. Dries fast. No oily residue. Even on days when I skip makeup altogether  I apply this after running errands in the heat and it cools my sensitive face without stinging. Definitely a good quality for the price and works as well as much more expensive light moisturizers. I recommend.
9757,Francesca,1,07-Dec-18,,This is a gel--I use RetinA and I mix the gel form of RetinA with this moisturizer and it just glides over my skin. I live on the coast if CA and last summer the heat just about killed me--but I put my little jar of moisturizer in the fridge (without the RetinA) and it was incredibly refreshing. Now it s winter and i love it just as much. And it isn t over-priced! I recommend it without reservation.
9758,Tara,1,29-May-16,One person found this helpful,This is my favorite moisturizer!  My skin is generally pretty good  but does tend to be a little shiny. Or occasionally a little flaky. Or both. This moisturizer is so great because it is one of the few that I have tried that addresses both problems without making me break out (did I say my skin is generally pretty good? Hmmm...)  Best of all is how light and refreshing my face feels after putting this on. It s a gel  and it leaves a nice  cool sensation. After it dries  it still feels nice on your skin  not oily or greasy or pore-clogging. So glad I decided to try this stuff out!
9759,Amazon Customer,1,25-Jun-18,,I would give this 5 stars if the moisture was enough for my dry areas. I have combination skin and after applying this I had to reach for my serums to double back on the dry skin around my eyes and forehead. I’m 28  so a younger person might not have to do this. For the rest of my skin this goes on like a dream. It’s cooking and melts into the skin almost instantly. It’s amazing as an under makeup moisturizer.
9760,Mrs.RedBeard,1,11-Jan-18,2 people found this helpful,This lotion lasts forever and really helps keep my skin hydrated throughout the day  especially in the dry winter.
9761,Amazon Customer,1,31-May-19,,Leaves my face sticky. Tried it with the garnier rose spray. A few fruit flies in my home were suddenly very attracted to my face. Don t recommend buying if you live in Florida where it s humid  sticky and buggy. Edit: They gave me a full refund without going through the hassle of returning the product. Great customer service. Added an extra star rating because of it.
9762,Mertyl,1,28-Jan-16,3 people found this helpful,Moisture Rescue Gel-Cream is the only moisturizer I will use. Well  until they discontinue it and then I will mourn the loss. My face is a bit sensitive and finding moisturizers without SLS or sunscreen is a nightmare. This absorbs well  smells ok  makes my skin feel great after abusing it with SLS free soaps. I can t ask for much more
9763,Kathryn Magendie,1,28-May-14,One person found this helpful,age: 57 skin: slightly sensitive  combination  This gel-cream is  refreshing  just as they claim. It s a completely different feel from my usual more emollient creams  and I find I particularly like it for hot days  just out of the shower  for day-time use (though I have to put sunscreen over it  but there s no problem to do that at all).  I wouldn t use this at night  when I want a more deeper moisturizing experience  and most probably I would not use it during winter months - though I don t want to rule that out until I ve tried it.  The scent is fresh and disappears after a few moments. All in all a nice little gel-cream that leave my face feeling fresh/refreshed.
9764,brooke barnard,1,17-Dec-18,,I have combo skin but this time of year my skin is very dry and almost gets flaky which makes putting up make up awful. After using this for two-ish weeks now my skin is no longer dry or flaky. I haven t used this during the summer months when my skin gets oily but I m hoping it still works just as well.
9765,Bloody Cupcake,1,14-Apr-19,,This is a terrific product! I love how hydrated and soft my skin is. It is non-irritating on my sensitive skin. Light pleasant fragrance and  to me  a little goes a long way. Feels light and fresh. I use it at night after washing and in the morning before applying my make up. Better than I expected  I just love it. Fast shipping and packaged well.
9766,kitty mei,1,17-Oct-17,2 people found this helpful,NICE ONE!good for.summer^O^very refresh and not oily at all also very.moisturizing^O^cute design and very.adorable^O^
9767,PMHanlon1369,1,20-Jul-17,2 people found this helpful,feather light  is absorbed into the skin at light speed  not sticky and very very spreadable. It is great for hydration without all the weight of a cream. No anti aging properties but all the moisture you ll ever need.
9768,keep it simple,1,11-May-17,One person found this helpful,Smooths on easily and sinks right in. My face is soft and moist  not greasy. I apply under sunscreen for daytime and on freshly washed face before bed. Almost every facial product causes breakouts for my sensitive skin. Not this one. I only wish they would tone down the fragrance. It is not objectionable and nearly unnoticeable once dry.
9769,Dena M. Jacobsen,1,16-Apr-18,,This stuff is amazing. It feels great on the skin  absorbs fast  leaves no residue  and a little goes a long way. I ve used it day and night for my combination skin and I m just finishing the container after about 2 months. I think it has helped my acne quite a bit by helping my face stay moisturized. Buying two more containers now because its cheapest here.
9770,Mixknickknacks,1,15-Oct-18,,Great moisturizer! I have a dry to oily skin and very sensitive to many make up/face cream (even hypoallergenic make up). This product is great  does not sting and/or did not irritate my skin. The  gel-like  creme is easily absorbed and does not leave any residue to the skin surface.
9771,Audra Leonard,1,26-Mar-15,2 people found this helpful,I bought this because I had read on pinterest this was a great dupe  to Clinique s moisture surge. Well..its not. It is a really nice product though  just not the same. I love that its a gel  its lightweight  light moisturizer (excellent for summer). But it doesn t have the power Clinique s does at all. I sometimes have to apply this twice. It does take it a while to dry on my face or soak up like. Im still pretty happy with this. I like it for my hands too! Its not greasy  feels very clean.
9772,Kindle Customer,1,27-Sep-17,2 people found this helpful,I use this at night. My skin is very sensitive to any moisturizers. Relied on Mary Kay but cannot afford the prices anymore. Will order this again.
9773,Maria IN N.Y.,1,01-Oct-17,2 people found this helpful,I JUST GOT THIS TODAY! I FIRST WASH MY FAVE WITH AVENO FACE CLEANER  THEY I APPLIED THE GARNIER SKIN RECUSE  IT MADE MY FACE VELVET SOFT AND SMOOTH  I LOVE IT  WII BUY AGAIN!
9774,Rose Davila,1,08-Mar-19,,This is a repeat buy for me. Although it isn t going to make peeling skin instantly moisturized. It s a light gel that does not make my sensitive skin break out. I ve had sensitive formula mositerizers upset my skin  this one does not and is a great price.
9775,Cat,0,09-Sep-18,One person found this helpful,It not only burns when you apply it to the face and I do not have sensitive skin at all  but it also totally dried up my face. I don t get all the positive reviews.
9776,Texas mom,1,14-Jun-17,4 people found this helpful,I really like this product; I chose the pink (dry skin) over the regular formula because it s summer and my skin tends to become more dry in the heat. The description on this product says  Let Moisture Rescue with Vitamin C and Antioxidant Fruit Water and moisture-loving ingredients come to your skin s rescue! This oil-free lightweight formula will help defend skin against external aggressors - none of this information is included in the regular formula  so for a buck or so more  I bought the pink one. At first it seemed a bit wet and sticky  but my skin totally sucked up the moisture and became very soft and light in a minute or two- I love the way it feels. I rarely wear makeup in the summer  but this product will be great with or without it anything on top of it. My face was not slick or oily all day- just soft and smooth and clean feeling. I knocked off one star because the seal was broken on the jar when I received it- kind of rumpled up. The lid was not open (it was securely closed)  but I did have to wonder if this was a product return that possibly someone else had stuck their finger in to try (yuck). I got over it when I considered the hassle of returning...hopefully the next jar I order will be sealed unlike this one.
9777,Michelle,1,28-May-15,3 people found this helpful,I like it! The packaging is adorable and it s the perfect size for on the go - not too big  not too small. I like that it is lightweight and absorbs easily into my skin. However  at times  it stings my face (I have very sensitive  combination skin - Lucky me!). I also find the smell pleasant - it is not too perfumy.
9778,Raven Dana,1,24-Jun-19,,My skin is VERY sensitive and this is one of the few products (including very expensive creams) that my skin likes. It does a very good job of keeping my face soft and is not oily at all. LOVE this product.
9779,Protein & Squats&#60;3,1,15-Jan-14,One person found this helpful,I ve been using this for quite a while now & it leaves my skin soooo smooth. It really does make your skin feel refreshed & you will see results right away. I used to have flaky  dry skin but this moisturizer has helped me so much. I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts & haven t had a breakout or anything. My skin loves this stuff. :)  A friend recommended this moisturizer to me. I used to use one of the Estee Lauder moisturizers & this one gives me just as great (if not better) results than the expensive ones & you save a ton of money. I definitely recommend this to everyone wanting smooth  healthy skin. :)
9780,A Wallace,1,17-Feb-19,,This Garnier Moisture Rescue is excellent for dry skin. It has a wonderful gel consistency that absorbs easily. It is also mild and does not irritate my somewhat sensitive skin. This is definitely a product I intend to use daily.
9781,Benni,0,13-Jun-17,2 people found this helpful,I didn t like this product. I bought this product based on reviews from Neutrogena hydroboost where people claimed this was a cheaper alternative. It definitely costs less. This gel cream has caused me to break out sporadically on my face. Maybe this applies to me only since I m prone to acne.
9782,lisa,1,20-Dec-13,3 people found this helpful,I am quite pleased with this. The gel dries quickly and into a softness (not a stickiness). My skin feels smooth. It is cooling and just the right and slight scent  which does not linger. I do not wear makeup mostly  so am glad I put it on also in the mornings. I cannot speak to how it would do umder makeup  but it does disappear into the skin  and leave it soft and dry. And the biggest reason I like gels as this  is that they have the tad tightening feeling as they dry. A little goes a long way  and don t forget the neck! Feels great!
9783,AmazonAddict,1,28-Nov-17,,I have to say  I am really impressed with this moisturizer. I have oily  sensitive skin. This provides just the right amount of moisturize without being oily  and works really well under makeup. It also has not caused any irritation or acne  even after using it for about a month. I m glad I took a chance on it  and I highly recommend for oily skin.
9784,Sandy S,1,31-Jan-19,,I love using both the regular (green gel) and the extra moisturizing gel because they go on so smoothly and never ever feel sticky or heavy. Both have lovely soft fragrance that is not overpowering. Please don t take this product off the market!!!
9785,Nel,1,16-Oct-17,,This has to be some of the best face moisturizer I ve ever used! My skin is usually dry and oil (weird  right) through out the day  but this stuff is amazing! I put it on after I wash my face in the morning and my skin stays so hydrated and soft all day! I hardly feel the need for makeup lately because my skin looks and feels so much healthier!
9786,IZZY,1,16-Aug-14,7 people found this helpful,Ladies are you looking for that one exhilarating moisturizer you ve been dying to get? Look no further and reach for this  food from the nutrient gods  non greasy facial treatment by Garnier. I can tell you in so many words how this tiny jar has saved and spared my face from skin deterioration and other infractions related to unkind outdoor impurities. But to suceed in making this feedback short and simple  I can only confess that this is a first rate oil free antidote and a must have for anyone who needs to treat and cure skin depletions and maintain even levels of moisturizing to conquer dryness and early signs of wrinkles. One single application of this soothing almost liquidfying gel you can feel immediately your unenergised face(skin)is getting an uplift pampering and healing like a therapeutic clay mask. Your inner pores will get the healthy benefits of receiving natural nutrients and your overall facial lines will be barely noticable. In addition your moisturized complexion will show a healthy glow after several days of repeated applications. The cucumber extracts are one of the main ingredients that make this moisturizer special because they cause gentle and cooling effects unlike any other. It s as if your entire face is bathed in lucious cucumbers. It s also noted that it s so safe you can even apply small amounts of gel under your eyes to eliminate puffiness and deep linings. I d recommend this exclusive product to anyone who needs extra extra moisturizing and protection plus as a remedy for all skin types suffer from blemished weather beatened and unbalanced skin :-)
9787,Rodger K Johnston,1,12-Sep-15,4 people found this helpful,My product arrived and was packaged well. The overall presentation of the product was excellent. The description on the box comes in English and French.This Gel ?Cream can be used by men or woman. It is has a nice fragrance and is easy to apply. It is non ?greasy and 100% oil free  I like the fact that it has been dermatologist tested for safety. Men can use it for elbows and other dry areas and the ladies can use it as a makeup base. This is a high quality product and I would recommend this to anyone.
9788,Gina,0,13-Feb-17,One person found this helpful,I gave this a 4 out of 5 but i have been using this a week and i have big to small white heads on my cheeks and lower jaw line. It smells really good but i find it is very drying. I have researched and alot of articles state dimeticone is a smoothing protein that traps moisture dirt and oil.
9789,Kimmy A.,1,29-Feb-16,One person found this helpful,For the price point  this product works very well. It goes on thick as a gel  but dries within minutes with no sticky residue. With most other moisturizers  my skin gets oily or looks greasy as the day goes on. However  this product keeps you matte and maybe a little dewy at most. The scent is light and refreshing  and it feels like a second skin locking in the moisture. I use it under my primer and foundation  and my makeup goes on very smooth and looks fresh. I would recommend this product to my friends if they re looking for an easy to use  economical daily moisturizer.
9790,cynthia gibbs,1,13-Jan-14,3 people found this helpful,I decided to purchase this gel based on another customers recommendation on another product and it was sooo worth trying out!!! So I have super sensitive skin that easily breaks out and flares up because I have systemic lupus  and this gel is so easy for my skin to tolerate. I use this gel on top of my Est?e Lauder Advanced Night Serum II at night  and then again by itself in the morning under all of my make up and it keeps my skin hydrated without feeling greasy. It really soaks into ur skin the moment u put it on ur face and I haven t seen any break outs when I use this gel by itself. Now if I can only find the perfect make up  I would have perfect skin lol
9791,Katie Cunningham,0,26-Sep-16,2 people found this helpful,I have very sensitive (fair) skin and this immediately gave me a bout of perioral dermatitis. Besides this  it doesn t really moisturize. It just evaporates off the skin. I had to toss it out after a week because of the dermatitis which immediately started to clear up.
9792,Susan W,1,19-May-19,,Excellent moisturizer! I like the gel consistency and goes on skin easily and light weight. Only thing missing is no SPF sun protection. Hope Garnier can add that to this product line.
9793,Amazon Customer,1,19-Apr-19,,I m only using this at night since it has no sunscreen. it is light and cool  not greasy or sticky. I like to go to bed with a clean face  but still need a little moisture. This is perfect for me.
9794,Celine,1,03-Jun-19,,Love this stuff. My dry skin disappeared immediately after one use. It s not greasy feeling at all!! I use it morning and night. It absorbs very quickly and I can put my makeup on right away. Love it!!!!
9795,Lisa,1,23-May-15,One person found this helpful,I m happy to have finally found something I can use for daytime. I love to use this every morning before I put my make up on. My face looks radient  feels incredibly soft and smooth. I like the fresh fruit scent. I have very sensitive skin and have no issues with this. My skin is also on the driest end of combination - this seems to help keep thing in balance. I like how almost weightless this is and just a tiny dab where needed goes a long way.
9796,Tammy Pham,1,05-May-19,,This product is actually beyond cheap for the performance. It keeps my face from drying up and helps my skin heal too. It helped getting rid of my acne scars and it softens my skin too. I’ve recommended this to many people and they share the same thoughts.
9797,Kindle Customer,1,04-Oct-14,One person found this helpful,I have very oily skin that is also dry (you know the type  shiny but sometimes flaky!) and the last thing I need during the day is a moisturizer that is going to leave a shiny film. After my morning Korean skin care steps  I apply this  and then cc cream and makeup. The gel goes on and feels cool and refreshing  then immediately sinks in. No stickiness  but none of that fresh-washed dryness  either. My skin  during the day  doesn t seem as shiny  and I have noticed increased elasticity. This is a keeper for me.
9798,mfreeman,1,21-Aug-18,,The best moisturizer I have tried EVER! My skin litterally drinks this up. I have extremely dry skin and this is the only thing that has ever helped me. My skin feels so much better and more hydrated. I will always repurchase this!
9799,Amazon Customer,1,09-Aug-14,One person found this helpful,This is excellent - very much as-advertised. I m mildly dry and sensitive and this moisturizes well for hours  without sitting on my skin and looking oily. I live in hot  dry Dallas and this is excellent for our climate; it absorbs quickly. This is pretty strongly fragranced; if that bothers you this may be an issue.  If you ve tried Clinique s Moisture On-Line  this is extremely similar. I find it to be more moisturizing than that product. Would highly recommend if you need a moisturizing  gentle product that won t sting sensitive (or redness prone) skin and won t look oily.
9800,kitty mei,1,28-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,Good product i recommend this for my.friend hope she will like it! This is a good gel moisturizer for summer*^O^*when you don t want to spend too much money on moisturizer.
9801,JKnup,1,12-Jun-19,,I purchased this on a whim just to see if it was similar to Clinque and it in fact is  so close that I don t believe I will ever purchase Clinque surge again.
9802,Lindsey,1,13-Apr-19,,I like this a lot. I usually use the Clinique rescue whatever the hell serum and I wouldn’t say this is a dupe but it works the same. Moisturizes without making me an oil slick
9803,Amazon Customer,1,22-Jan-19,,I ve never had a gel moisturizer before so I can t compare but I do love this product. It goes on smooth  makes my face feel cool and definetly does the trick. I ve only had it a day so far (will update if opinion changes)  but so far  I love it.
9804,Miss Saemyi,1,05-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,keeps my skin moisturized without feeling like it s caked on. i like the gel texture of the cream. it allows my skin to breathe better.

I use this in green jar as a day cream  the other  pink jar as night cream. You haven t lived till you spread that cold  refreshing gel on your skin! It is especially heavenly if you have any degree of rosacea with the accompanying face-on-fire feel.
9806,cattgirl813,1,28-Apr-19,,Lightweight  not greasy  perfect moisture for combination skin. A little goes a long way. I ve tried several moisturizers  and this is the best of them all.
9807,J.O,1,13-Aug-18,,It’s moisturizing but my face burned for a few minutes after I put it on. I’m not sure if it’s because my skin is very sensitive or if it’s the moisturizer it’s self.  ***please mark as  useful  if this review helped you.
9808,DeejWeej,1,01-Apr-14,One person found this helpful,I try other moisturizers and keep coming back to this one. It only takes a small amount at a time and I use it for both day and night moisturizing. It is not greasy  has a fresh fragrance and absorbs well. I still use and eye cream first. It add the needed hydration to my face and my foundation goes on smoothly. Please note this is not a wrinkle reducing moisturizer but mostly for hydration which is what I need. For the price  it is worth a try. If you don t care for it  you can always use it on your hands.
9809,Stephany L.,1,22-Feb-19,,I love this moisturizer! It feels cooling  is not sticky and it soaks into your Skin name fairly quickly. I will update in time since I have been using this for 2 days lol
9810,Tilly Ramsey,1,09-May-19,,This face gel it’s a must have. My skin looks clean  hydrated  moisturized. Does not clog the pores  it’s very light and super easy to aply.
9811,C. L.,1,01-Jun-16,,I bought this because I tried an expensive Korean gel-cream moisturizer and loved it! This isn t quite as good as that sample I tried  but definitely worth the price point. I tend to have oily-combo skin which makes it difficult to find suitable moisturizers that don t make me look greasy or clog my pores while still hydrating my drier spots. This definitely does the trick! Will probably repurchase.
9812,Hope E. Lockhart,1,27-May-19,,This is definitely a great moisturizer! My face has been so dry here in Florida and this has made a huge diff! Smells so fresh as well

9816,Amazon Customer,0,29-Mar-18,,This product clearly works for some skin types as evident by all the great reviews  but not mine. It goes on nice  feels good  and isn t super sticky  but my skin felt dry again 20 minutes later. I have dry patches with regular areas  so combo to dry. Also  the container is TINY. Like you can wrap your hand around most of it. Not to mention  the container was only about 3/4 full. So as far as value goes  I don t feel like I m getting my money s worth in amount either.
9817,Monika C,1,16-Nov-15,,I really like this moisturizer. It has a light scent. I d describe it as clean or cucumber. The scent doesn t linger after you put on the product  though. Garnier claims that skin will feel instantly smooth and this was absolutely true for me. My skin felt soft and smooth immediately. It s a lightweight gel-cream so it is cool on the skin and doesn t leave any sticky residue or leave the skin feeling heavy. Refreshing  indeed!  Disclaimer-This product was given to me for free. As always  I used it several times before posting my review.

The smell and texture is awesome. Most importantly feels great on my skin. Very light weight and aborbs quickly. From experience  most products that say it keeps its moisture usually NEVER keeps it moisture in but this product actually does. I m shocked. It s unique because it a gel like moisturizer and it is very light weight and it actually hold moisture in longer than 5 minutes. I m glad I gave this product a try. I recommend it highly.
9826,Linda,1,14-Jun-18,,I have a dry T-zone  but oily  creamy products seemed to just block my pores and not moisturize. I needed this  water-based product to moisturize my skin. Must be the type of skin you have.

An ex-girlfriend of mine was in love with this stuff and I always wondered why. One day I tired it after I got some minor sunburn. WOW! It was great. Made my face feel cool and fresh.  Instead of my face being oily or dried out it now feels just like skin. Every day. And I couldn t be happier.  My only regret is not buying the bigger sized bottle.

9829,Wendi,1,21-May-17,One person found this helpful,This is my go-to moisturizer. I have oily skin  and other products make me break out. This is gentle  soothing  and moisturizes my skin. It also has a clean  cucumber scent that is a plus!
9830,Brian,1,30-May-15,One person found this helpful,My favorite moisturizer. It feels very light and like water but dries great without any oily feeling. Does not seem to exacerbate acne. Each gel lasts me between 2-3 months. I have subscribed to this item for every 5 months and I get 5% off. I have been using this for over 2 years and highly recommend people to try this! It is more of a clear gel than a cream.
9831,TB,1,12-Jan-19,,Having dry and acne-prone skin at the same time is annoying. This moisturizes and doesn’t break me out or cost a lot. Love it!
9832,Jessica Honeycutt,1,06-Dec-18,,My husband and I love this product!!! It’s moisturizer without any of the oil! Great also for sunburns
9833,M. J. Anderson,1,17-Jun-19,,Love this moisturizer. It feels invisible and gives that fresh face feeling. I have an oily t-zone and I love this stuff.
9834,KMG,0,13-Jun-18,,The denatured alcohol in this gel moisturizer ended up making my face drier rather than more moisturized. It seemed ok at first  but by the end of the day my face would be flaky in patches.
9835,Deborah Salgado,1,31-Dec-18,,I have been trying to find a facial moisturizer that isn t greasy an helps my dry skin. This has helped my skin feel soft and refreshed.
9836,Alexistho,1,07-Apr-19,,This is a superior product! Clears dry winter skin in a heartbeat and the price is unbeatable.
9837,Daisey,1,13-Aug-16,2 people found this helpful,Used this for almost a year and I love it. It s light  not greasy and makes my skin soft. I so hope they don t stop making it! That happened with another one of their products years ago. I m almost 60 and told I have amazing skin....try it.
9838,CZGator,1,25-Jul-16,3 people found this helpful,I don t usually use Garnier products but I was looking for a lightweight  affordable moisturizer that was not greasy. I saw the  gel cream  description and gave it a try. It is actually quite nice  has a smell that reminded me of cucumbers (it is not quite like that  and there is no cucumber in it  but it is not a flowery odor.) The consistency is light but not watery and it works well under makeup  kind of like a primer. It has alcohol in it  which ironically enough  a lot of moisturizers do  so it may not be good for those with very dry skin. Professional beauty experts critique the formula but users seem to like it. I did  but bear in mind this does not have anything in it that will actually modify your skin. See for yourself; here are the ingredients: Water  Glycerin  Alcohol Denatured  Dimethicone  Isononyl Isononanoate  Carbomer  Dimethiconol  Chlorphenesin  Caprylyl Glycol  Sodium Hydroxide  Grape Fruit Extract  Xanthan Gum  Tetrasodium EDTA  Tocopheryl Acetate  Ascorbyl Glucoside  Menthoxypropanediol  Magnesium Gluconate  Sodium Citrate  Benzyl Salicylate  Linalool  Calcium Gluconate  Biosaccharide Gum-1  Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde  Butylphenyl Methylpropional  Yellow 5  Blue 1  Fragrance  Phenoxyethanol.
9839,Ashley,1,20-Oct-16,3 people found this helpful,This is now my 4th jar of this. My first time buying from Amazon as I have bought my other 3 from Walmart and each time I m in love with this product! I seriously can t go without it now!! I have combination skin to the extreme. Very oil prone in some spots and dry in others. The dry spots have always needed moisturizer but I was so afraid to use any for fear of angering the other. I found this out of pure desperation. My skin was just so dry and angry and spots I needed help. I found this and it has literally been heaven in a jar! It leaves behind no oil residue yet it provides a wonderful hint of moisture that s not too much and not too little. A little goes a long way too! I just put a little dab on my finger and that s enough. It has almost like a cool effect when you put it on. There is no menthol or anything like that in it but because it s a gel and gel is just cold  it does have a cool feeling when applying I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone! Not just people with combination skin but anyone who wants to moisturize without that heavy feeling on your face :)
9840,Samantha,1,06-Apr-19,,I don’t have a whole lotta experience with moisturizing my face but this made my face feel like silk after I used it. It’s so nice!!
9841,RockyTopRebels,1,11-Nov-18,,Love this product. Excellent for dry skin. Product arrived in dual original packaging wrapped in plastic.
9842,Ellie Kelly,1,30-Jun-19,,This is my favorite summer moisturizer. Not too heavy and has a cooling effect.
9843,Linny,1,20-Feb-15,,Okay  so. I have bought this product three times now (once in the drugstore  twice on Amazon). I have to say  I love this product. I have oily skin  and this is the only moisturizer that I have used that makes my skin feel hydrated but not oily. The only real disclaimer I have to say is that I noticed when I buy the product on Amazon  it has a different weird smell to it compared to when I buy it at the drugstore...
9844,Cyndy,1,05-Apr-18,,I buy this over and over. It makes your skin feel very silky. It feels like it’s a very expensive gel type moisturizer. Love love love
9845,Ryan M.,0,21-Feb-18,,I was looking for long lasting moisture throughout the year  especially the winter months ... and this did nothing for me. Smells good though
9846,SA,1,13-Feb-19,,I started doing the 10. Korean steps to healthy skin and this made a great addition to my regimen
9847,R. Tcherkez,1,28-Oct-17,,Doesn t make me look like I could fuel a car with my facial oil 2 seconds after application. This is a huge plus. Yuuuge. Very light texture and scent and the container looks cute and dainty.
9848,KC Elkun,1,11-Jun-18,,It feels nice  smells nice  but definitely too watery for me. I mix it with other oily cream (sun protection) and this way it works for me.
9849,Puppy,1,18-Dec-18,,I liked. I wearer different products to keep my skin healthy. I found other products better.
9850,Pattycat Meyer,1,31-May-16,,I really love this product....it is like putting thick water onto your face...so refreshing. Sometimes I don t even follow with my cream moisturizer  skin feels so nice. Not oily or greasy...soft. It took a few uses before I realized that just a little goes a long way.
9851,a. rexius,1,08-Feb-16,,Love this product and have been unable to find it locally for quite some time. For those who don t like gels  this isn t for you. It does give you a sticky feeling until it soaks in  but that is very quick. I love it! I don t have a greasy after feel  and I don t have to worry about my sensitive skin! Plus it smells great!
9852,cindy,1,07-Mar-19,,Great moisturizer... feels like a cooling gel. Works wonders I love it.
9853,henmah886,1,29-Jan-18,,I have combination sensitive skin and this is my first ever jar of moisturizer in 31 years which is about to get empty. It s in gel form very light but does moisturize your skin well. My skin thanks me!
9854,Kindle Customer,1,20-Apr-18,,The third time I have purchased. Probably the nicest moisturizer that I havefound for dry skin that is not greasy and make your face look  slick .
9855,ShellyB.,1,25-Aug-15,One person found this helpful,i REALLY like this rescue remedy. In the hot climate  I feel like my skin dehydrates  and this refreshes  replenishes  and goes on light  COOL  and feels like it absorbs in a minute. I use under makeup  and after makeup  and in between. Great stuff.
9856,WJMT,1,06-May-18,,Although it makes my skin feel more plump and supple  my skin is possibly too dry  as it seemed to disappear much too quickly.
9857,J. Blair,1,14-Feb-12,One person found this helpful,My sensitive skin breaks out into pimples from most face creams  even the ones for sensitive skin. This one works decently enough to use under mineral makeup (not too greasy  not too thin)  and doesn t clog my small pores or give me a rash.  My only complaint is the amount of fragrance. It s not a bad smell (green apple-ish)  but it is rather strong.  It s not a cream at all  it s 100% gel  almost identical to aloe vera in texture and transparency.
9858,urooj k.,1,14-Jun-19,,Oommmmggg!!!! This stuff is amazing! And the texture is insane  wow my face from sand paper to butter instantly. By far the best I ve ever bought!!!
9859,MommaFox,1,09-Feb-19,,I love using this. Makes my skin glow and look good.
9860,Ashley Whittaker,1,27-Apr-16,,I usually buy the same product but the green one. I decided to give this one a try. It doesnt go on as easily  its pretty thick. Still smooth but pastey. It has a light pleasant smell. It does help with my dry skin on my face but i wouldnt buy it again. Ill go back to the green one.
9861,Riss,1,13-May-15,,I love this stuff. It is so refreshing. I use it 1-2 a day. It leaves my skin moisturized but also refreshed. It s got a clean smell but not too over powering. I will never go back to using the  typical  facial moisturizer. The gel leaves my skin feeling much more moisturized and the gel feels nice and refreshing.
9862,Kim,1,27-Jan-19,,I use this every night on top of any serums or moisturizers. My skin feels like a baby’s in the morning.
9863,Kaitlynn,0,06-May-19,,This break me out. I have sensitive  oily  acne prone skin...all the things.
9864,Magnolia Mom,1,01-Feb-17,4 people found this helpful,I absolutely LOVE this gel moisturizer! I have combination skin  and I m an old broad  and I ve tried many moisturizers that are supposed to be non-oily  but aren t. This wonderfully-scented heavenly gel moisturizes my face and feels so clean doing it. It feels so silky going on and even firms my skin a bit. The glowing reviews I read convinced me to take a chance on the mint-colored Moisture Rescue Gel for Normal/Combo skin and I m thrilled that I did. Just to satisfy my curiosity I m ordering Garnier s SkinActive  sister  pink gel for Dry Skin when I reorder the blue. I can t promise this awesome moisturizing gel cream is for everyone  but I have a feeling it ll be great for most! Garnier skin products are something I love - THANKS  Garnier! P.S. Their SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water is amazing  too. And as an  old broad   I m hard to please. You might consider trying that as well. And no  I didn t get anything for this or any other review. (You re welcome  Garnier! LOL)
9865,W.G.S.,1,19-Jun-18,,We have bought this several times and my daughter loves it. She has acne prone skin and it does not cause breakouts.
9866,Maja Holman,1,01-Jun-19,,It feels great. I can tell it lasts as I no longer feel dry patches of skin on my face
9867,Allie B.,1,20-Feb-16,3 people found this helpful,Love this stuff! Almost as good as the Clinique gel moisturizer at 1/4 of the price.
9868,VioletJune,1,31-Jan-15,2 people found this helpful,I love this lotion. I have very dry skin in the winter but other heavy lotions were making my face break out. This keeps it hydrated without being greasy or too heavy. I like the scent  it is refreshing. Plus  the scent doesn t hang around that long.
9869,Moskwaka,1,13-Dec-17,,I really like this product. It moisturizes well without feeling sticky or greasy. Seems to melt into your skin. Will definitely be purchasing again.
9870,TheMrs,1,13-May-16,9 people found this helpful,I really love this stuff. It s the only stuff I can use that doesn t make me break out! It s creamy  but gel and not sticky at all! It s cooling and smells great! But really I love that there is no sticky residue on hands or face! It s great!!!
9871,Nicole S,1,09-Sep-15,,I used a very expensive clinique moisturizer for years for my very oily skin. I got tired of spending the money and decided to try this gel. I m hooked. It s very cooling and refreshing. It provides just enough moisture without being too much  and isn t sticky or thick at all. The price is right  and as long as they don t discontinue it  I ll be a customer for life.
9872,Nicole C.,1,12-Jan-19,,Don t notice much difference in my skin I have normal skin type
9873,picky consumer,1,26-Jan-15,One person found this helpful,love this face cream. Have sensitive skin and have tried all different kinds over the years; and this is the best I ve found. Maybe because it a  gel/combo.. Just wish it came in a bigger size; the packaging is twice the size of the jar  so it is deceptive if you see it on a store shelf.
9874,Katyana labs,1,17-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,very liquid.. not thick... but good... feel fresh
9875,Amanda,1,22-Mar-19,,One of my favorire moisturizers ever.
9876,MARK,1,26-Apr-19,,Use this prouct on overseas flights and at night on the ocean. Great product for the price
9877,Simona,1,17-Oct-13,,This is my favorite moisturizer. I use this as a day cream under my make up as well as night cream. I love that it is gel because it absorbs so much faster. I ve been buying it for the past two years and I can t switch back to creams. This spoiled me. I have oily t-zone and this doesn t make my face oily at all but it does take care of my dry areas. I love this moisturizer and I will continue using it!
9878,Heather Crago,1,13-Jun-19,,Absolutely amazing consistency. A little goes a long way. Does not leave an oily feeling. Keeps my skin soft and hydrated.
9879,Jackie,1,08-Nov-16,,I really like this moisturizer! It goes on as a gel  but then soaks into the skin. After applying  my skin feels hydrated  but also matte. It doesn t leave an oily or slick feeling on the skin. I use it as a supplement to my normal moisturizer (Argan oil) for extra spot-area moisture just before putting on makeup. My skin can get really flaky in certain areas  and this certainly helps when applying makeup  as that will always enhance the flakiness. Good buy!
9880,AverageJane,1,05-Dec-17,,I love gel face products and usually use a more expensive dept store brand. This seems to be working justs as well and feels great on the skin.
9881,Rina I,1,23-May-16,,I use this moisturizer on my face every morning. It s very light and dries without shine  which is perfect for me. I have combination skin  so oily t-zone and dry skin everywhere else. This refreshes my face in the morning and evens out my skin s complexion.
9882,Bee B,1,23-Jan-16,,Not sticky like the pink one. I think it makes my forehead shiny  but not in an oily way at all  more like a clean layer. I like that it dries on my face without feeling dry. I agree with other reviewers who ve said it s like smearing water on your face. It s light and cool in a really pleasant way that doesn t make me dread moisturizing (I hate putting anything on my face).
9883,Ali C,1,19-Apr-19,,It makes my skin a bit oily but it does keep my face moist.
9884,Anna Glezina,1,11-Jun-19,,Absolutely love it!!!
9885,Cat H.,1,11-Mar-15,One person found this helpful,I purchased this mainly because of some severely dry skin I have been having. I am glad that I did. I ve been using this every day for about 2-3 days now  and it has helped my dry skin issues  I would buy this again. This also has a real nice fruity fragrance.
9886,Hannah,0,24-Oct-18,,unfortunately  it makes me break out in tiny spots. it also smells like alcohol. I think it would work quite well for most people but beware if you have sensitive skin
9887,Proud mommy,1,07-Nov-17,,I buy this for my husband who has sensitive oily skin. He loves it and it works well for him. The price on Amazon is great compared to in store
9888,Agatha Christie,1,15-Dec-12,2 people found this helpful,I was buying this face cream locally but found a much better price on Amazon. I only wish it contained a couple more ounces. It is a green gel that feels cool when I put it on. It moisturizes very well. I had thought its coolness would be unwelcome in winter but I was wrong. When my face gets dry in the winter the cool gel is soothing and moisturizing.
9889,Mindsurfer,1,25-Oct-15,,This is the only facial moisturizer that doesn t either irritate me from scents or completely break me out from oils. As long as you aren t lazy and wash your face at the end of the day (it can allow grease to build up during the day) it ll work great.
9890,bluemoon100,1,30-Aug-18,,This product is moisturizing without being heavy and greasy on my oily skin.
9891,Colorist,1,07-Sep-15,,This my second jar  and I had not even finished the first. Very nice useful product. Price is good  a bit under retail unless on sale/coupon etc. I did learn that it is not good to put it OVER certain other products. Seems best to put on right after cleansing.
9892,Kimberly Younger,1,01-Oct-18,,I love this product.
9893,Tommy H,1,02-Jun-15,,I love this stuff.. I am a man and my facial skin sometimes gets very dry. I use this stuff now whenever I need it; I like it because it has almost no scent  and the little there is is very pleasant  not flowery or perfumey. I dislike fragrance very much  so this is perfect for me and works well.
9894,Dhiman,1,07-May-15,,It’s light on the skin with a fresh scent. I wouldn t recommend this for anyone with Very dry skin as it isn t as moisturizing as a cream. I used this during the summer months and I felt it provided decent moisture. It is very light and smells good. So I ll recommend this for summer use.
9895,Miss Lately,1,19-Feb-19,,Will buy again! Feels great.
9896,Elle,1,28-Jun-14,,Like a refreshing drink for my skin! I have oily  acne-prone skin  and this is one of the few products that doesn t cause me to breakout. Super happy that I found this! It smells nice and is light and refreshing. If you have super dry skin  I m guessing this would not be enough moisture. If you have normal to oily  you will probably like it!
9897,Jane Doe,0,19-May-14,,I read a blog saying this was a dupe for Clinique gel moisturizer; not even close. This has no moisturizing effect at all; once it dries  it is just gone. I did find some use for it though. I mixed it with a way-too-heavy moisturizer I had so two unusable products yielded a decent result. Still going to be forking over the $$$ for Clinique gel.
9898,Megan,1,15-Jun-13,,I got this product a month ago and to be honest it s really not bad. The product doesn t make me break out and it leaves my face feeling super refreshed after applying the product. The only down side is that a few hours later  it makes my face really oily and shiny. My face is a combination of everything  so it s really hard to find good moisturizers for my face. I actually stop using this because of how my face would become so oily/shiny after a few hours later. Would I recommend this? Yes I would. I understand we all are different. Even though this product isn t for me  it could be for you!
9899,Amelia4855,1,31-Mar-19,,Always loved this product was glad to find it on amazon
9900,Dee,1,06-Apr-16,4 people found this helpful,Oh I love thee!!! I have a very serious combination skin  african-american. Highly acne prone and hyper-pigmented. With all I ve tried  Its either the lotion is too drying or when it actually moisturizes well  I break out! I have actually tried garnier s dark spot remover with vit-C but it didn t work. This is just right. A cool lovely burst of moisture. My face feels hydrated from the very first night I used it and now I ve started going lower to my neck and chest. This is priceless for me. Thank you Garnier!!! I have only used this for 4 days  but had to review  this shows how excited i am. I ll be sure to update with any changes/improvement.
9901,CapeCodAtHeart,1,11-Jun-18,,I love the gel for the summer. Doesn’t seem as greasy to me Soaks in quickly.
9902,Annie Ware,1,05-Aug-17,,The only facial moisturizer I can tolerate. Not greasy at all. I love it.  Don t leave the cap open  as I think it does evaporate a little bit.
9903,Lindsey,0,21-Jul-14,,I wanted to love this product but my skin could not. I have sensitive combo skin and although this product didn t make me break out (thank god)  my skin did instantly turn red and felt like it was slightly sunburned. Unfortunately something (probably the fragrance or citrus acid) made me have an allergic reaction and I gave it to a friend who loves it! for anyone with sensitive skin looking for a night cream  I highly recommend the Burts Bee s Sensitive Night Cream
9904,NelsonFam,1,15-Apr-19,,It is as described  enjoying the product.

9906,Ben,1,27-Feb-16,One person found this helpful,This gel was great! I have dry skin and this product solved the issue.  The gel smells fruity and goes on smoothly...it has the texture of hand sanitizing gel. After a few days of the pounding that my face gets (shaving and martial arts training) my skin truly looks and feels healthier.  I will continue using this product and hopefully the results continue to improve.
9907,Amazon Customer,1,02-May-18,,Super lightweight and moisturizes so well. I am in love with this stuff. Doesn t feel like I put anything on at all but still leaves my face soft and silky!
9908,ShellyB.,1,02-May-14,3 people found this helpful,This very reasonably priced gel moisture cream is my new go to moisturizer  ESPECIALLY  for UNDER MAKEUP. I live in tropical South Florida  and it s already in the high 80s  with 90 percent humidity. The last thing I want as an under-makeup moisture cream is come super creamy thick or greasy start.  This gel is so cooling  and firming. IT is awesome. It feels good from the minute it s on your face  and seems to have a drawing effect when it dries  and it dries relatively quickly. When it does  you still have the clean face  with a cool palate.  Makeup seems to go on and stay on better. I have been using it at night  and even through the day. I just love it. Because I am trying to limit my time in the sun  but  still want that sun-kissed tropical glow  I use artificial tanners  and this is great underneath them  as well  because  it does the same thing that it does under makeup  which is to moisturize and create a good conditioned skin. That way  no streaking takes place.
9909,Sister Avalon,1,04-Jul-17,4 people found this helpful,I took a shot with this moisturizer. I have oddball skin. It s horribly dry sometimes  then it s like I dunked my face in a vat of oil. ?? My friend suggested that I try gel moisturizer to help balance out my skin. It isn t too shabby honestly. Light scent and it does help my face be slightly less oily. Worth $5 & change. I couldn t afford the high end brands from cosmetic chains and they cost $36+ for one little jar/container. *4.7 stars*
9910,Linda,1,16-Apr-19,,Love the feeling on my skin but I don t see any difference in my skin but I like the feel.
9911,KAF,1,01-Mar-15,,I love this moisturizer. The consistency is a light gel that smooths onto the skin. It soaks in quickly and smells very nice. It has kept my skin from peeling all winter  but I am sure it is light enough that it wouldn t feel heavy in the summer. My skin is prone to breaking out  and this has not caused any problems at all.
9912,Justyna,1,10-Jan-18,,love the cooling feeling the gel gives you in the morning but it does not moisturize as much as it says it should
9913,Katie Sanchez,1,11-Dec-18,,This is alright my mom loves it but I couldn’t tell much difference
9914,Yani,1,20-Sep-18,,it made my skin very soft  light smell just perfect.
9915,jkbeets,1,17-Jun-15,,Absolutely LOVE this cream  it s probably my third one. Very light  smells awesome  and absorbs super fast. I have very gentle combination skin that tends to be more on the dry side  this cream literary make my skin super soft and so normal. No shine forehead or dry cheeks  my whole face feels just amazing!
9916,Jennifer,1,08-Jan-18,,LOVE this stuff. It doesn’t make my skin too greasy/too dry and I have oily/combination skin. My only complaint would be the smell of the product. It has a very strong chemical smell to it and it’s a little off putting but it still does it’s job and does it well!
9917,WCC,0,16-Sep-14,3 people found this helpful,I was really looking forward to receiving this product because it is amazing and works well on my sensitive and dry skin  leaving it moist. However  when I got the package  the seal to the product was tampered with. It was obvious that the product had been opened before. I recommend spending the extra dollar or two and buying it from the store.
9918,Amazon Customer,1,28-Feb-18,,This is my favorite face moisturizer  doesn t leave my face feeling greasy or sticky and smells great.
9919,Patty S,1,24-Jun-17,,I have been using this product for years. Non-greasy  and yet my skin is still so soft. Soaks in quickly  and one needn t use a ton of the product! Good stuff!
9920,vic,1,29-Sep-17,,great if you want to avoid pimple everywhere  just don t put it that much. A dab or two would be enough for the whole face

9927,ratcliff,1,13-Feb-16,,I love this moisturizer. My local Target stopped carrying it. so as long as I can purchase it here  I am happy. It s light and refreshing. It has a pleasant smell and doesn t cause breakouts like heavy creams often do. I ve been buying it for years.
9928,ELHH,1,17-Sep-16,,It s not greasy at all and it absorbs very quickly. My skin feels very soft after applied it. But it will not be strong enough for fall and winter for sure because I can feel a bit of dryness now.

9933,Gift Card,1,29-May-14,,My skin changes with the seasons - warmer months I m more greasy  colder months I m more dry. This cream has a light scent and its great to wear under a dry-touch sunscreen for 6 months out of the year - which is exactly what I wanted. Makeup looks great on top of it  and it s inexpensive. Great product!
9934,Anupma Sahay,1,16-Feb-14,4 people found this helpful,I was in need for a face moisturizer because this terrible winter weather in Philadelphia was drying out my skin and hitting my face hard. I scoured Amazon and looked at more than 10 different moisturizers within my budget before settling on this one based on the reviews. I have been using this product for about a month now and ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! I have sensitive skin and am of Indian heritage so my skin needs a lot of moisture. I am not one to spend hours on makeup and hair  but this is something that I look forward to using everyday. It is incredibly refreshing and makes me feel energized - the gel texture is so much better than creams. I can really see that my skin has improved -- it is more even  soft  and bright. I ve gotten many compliments on my skin since using this too! This product is awesome and affordable! I truly recommend this to everyone!!!!!
9935,melissa martin,1,12-Mar-18,,I really enjoyed this. It moisturizes your face without causing acne. It takes very little of this to moisturize your face daily.
9936,Nicole Wilcox,1,27-Jun-16,8 people found this helpful,First off I have to say I have extremely acne prone  sensitive skin. I have a graveyard of products I have tried and just didn t work for me. But this is a moisturizer I just keep coming back to. It s lightweight but still goes in deep into the skin. I even wear it under my makeup. I like that it s not a thick cream  more like a gel  and no breakouts! Would recommend to everyone!
9937,Jaquaya,1,10-Oct-16,One person found this helpful,This is a MUST have ladies! I can really see the difference in my skin. I will purchase again.
9938,Erin Beever,0,20-Nov-18,,Didn t like this at all. After using  my skin felt more dried out and tight than it did before I put it on.
9939,Amazon Customer,1,08-Nov-17,,Fantastic. I have oily skin. This is perfect for me. Very clean. Not greasy at all.
9940,CC,1,13-Jan-18,,Great for summer months  feels cool on application  dries fast  smooth feeling.
9941,Austin,1,11-Feb-19,,gives that perfect balance for my combination skin
9942,Chanel,1,24-Jul-16,,I tried this out on a whim since I have been using Garnier s charcoal facewash. This is my third time re purchasing it. So many other moisturizing products actually make me break out. This is the perfect balance for my skin.
9943,James Michael,1,23-Jan-18,,This is the only cream that heals my dry skin on my face.
9944,Kindle Customer,1,27-Sep-17,,Light but thoroughly moisturizing. Scent is light but pleasant. Will buy again.
9945,ExplosiveCake,0,21-Jan-16,3 people found this helpful,This was said in another review  but it makes my skin shiny and gross. My skin doesn t seem to actually absorb it  and it just sits on top. The gel feels cool and pleasant when you first put it on though.  It also gave me horrible breakouts. I have no history of acne  and I nearly had a heart attack when I saw my face. Pimples everywhere  and red  angry rashes. I have no idea what is in this  but my skin hated it.  A few weeks later when I was tired  I started putting it on my face.. Until I remembered what the hell it did. Sure enough  a breakout popped up only on that part of my face.  I dunno what garnier is doing. They should rename this product  Satan s Magic Zit Potion. 
9946,T. Stone,1,01-Jan-12,One person found this helpful,Love this moisturizer. I have oily skin so I needed something that would give me the moisture I needed without the greasy feeling. This product is light but provides the nutrients my skin needs. It good for the summer underneath foundation. I have also used it underneath my tinted moisturize and it didn t leave me feeling greasy. They were quite compatible. I would highly recommend this product.
9947,Danibobani,1,11-Aug-14,,When I moved to Colorado my skin was super dry. I used a clinique face lotion that dries out after a few hours. Since this is gel it goes on smooth and really moisturizes. It s not oily and drys fast. I recommend using this to my friends that go up in the mountains where it s even dryer. LOVE this stuff.
9948,YimYorm,1,26-May-16,,Love this cream! Its light and great and refreshing after a shower. It does get oily or clog pores and never had a break out with this  I highly recommend this 3 years strong with this
9949,Amazon Customer,1,28-Apr-18,,Love that I can moisturize and not feel oily afterwards!
9950,Amazon Customer,0,22-Jul-18,,Smell is very strong and awful
9951,Debra Poore,1,01-May-14,,I bought this for my husband  who has a problem with itchy and flaky skin on his face. I can only say that he loves it and has told me to buy more when he runs out. And this is from a guy who never pays much attention to what he uses on his face  just uses what I buy at the store!
9952,Amazon Customer,1,30-Apr-18,,Skin feels refreshed already
9953,jyf1023,1,15-Nov-15,,I really enjoyed using this lightweight gel cream this summer  perfect for my dry skin. However  I will need to switch to something more moisturizing for fall/winter  as I have been waking up with dry face in the morning.
9954,E McD,0,15-Jul-15,One person found this helpful,The chemical/ alcohol smell was hard for me to get past  as well as the sticky texture. It really did not do much for my dry skin either  even when I tried applying multiple times per day.
9955,Amazon Customer,1,20-Feb-18,,love the feel
9956,Sam,1,15-Jul-15,,My skin is more on the combo side (somewhat oily) and I love how light this gel cream is! I do not have to apply too much of it and it definitely keeps my skin moisturized  but not to the point where it is very oily. Would recommend!
9957,April,1,27-Aug-18,,good
9958,Momof2,1,17-Nov-16,,Really refreshing and easily absorbed by the skin just the right amount of moisture i think this is great for all skin types! My go to daily moisturizer
9959,FCodd,1,25-Aug-15,,Like this product! I am a 32 yr old female. Normal skin  typical skin issues (blemishes/ sun exposure/life) Easy to use  nice smell  absorbs quick and no remaining residue. Wish the bottle was bigger! Price is very nice too.
9960,Brandon,1,23-Mar-17,,This is a rebuy  cheaper here than riteaid. But i love this product  sinks in so nice! Prefect for combo skin.
9961,J. Park,0,01-Nov-17,,Not hydrating enough  even on the oilier parts of my combination skin. Started getting dry patches on my face. I did like the texture and scent.
9962,jogee,1,15-Jun-18,,this cream works great
9963,Young,1,02-Feb-16,,I m allergic to so many cosmetic stuff  but this one is mild  light  not sticky  but keep my skin moistured  I am happy with it. I love the gel texture  and cool feeling of it. I ll get more after the first one :)
9964,Melissa Nievera-Lozano,1,09-Dec-15,,Been using this non-irritating  cool to the touch  gel-cream for a couple years now. Got my spouse using it  too  and he can t do without it now! We share a bottle and subscribe to regular shipments every month. A little goes a long way. Worth every penny!
9965,phil,1,18-Mar-11,2 people found this helpful,Bought by my boyfriend because my skin has been a little tight and dry lately  product of a very cold winter. This does the trick moisturizing wise. Leaves you with a great cooling feeling right after applying and you only need to use a small amount for your whole face and neck( i shake it before using and just use a little from what sticks to the top of the container). I use a powder foundation and i found a couple hours after applying my skin is a little oily in the T-zone  which normally wouldnt happen without the Garnier Refreshing Gel Cream  but i just blot and bye bye oily shine. Im also prone to breakouts and this has not affected my skin acne wise  but i would say is making my skin alot smoother. Over all it s a good product  just use sparingly especially if you have oily skin.
9966,Lori,1,03-Apr-18,,glides on nice and is not greasy at all
9967,Elizabeth,0,26-Jul-17,,It doesn t feel like it does any moisturizing. I wouldn t recommend this to anyone with any type of skin. It does however  have no scent.
9968,sharlee,1,26-Oct-14,,I have tried may facial cream to help with dry skin. I found that I don t like the feel of most of them on my skin. This is light. I don t notice it  but it helps with the dryness. Along with this moisturizer  I also use Garnier Ultra-Lift at night.
9969,Alyssa Grace Edwards,0,02-May-14,One person found this helpful,This did not last very long  and it didn t really help my skin...didn t hurt it either but ultimately not great  and overpriced. I d recommend the Alba Botanica moisturizer instead. Plus they don t test on animals!
9970,CVD,1,01-Aug-16,,Great moisturizer that hydrates your skin but doesn t leave it feeling greasy or oily. I love how you can put it on and it immediately absorbs into your skin  and it is mild & gentle. Great for normal and/or combo skin (normal/oily) but it may not be enough moisturizing if you have dry skin.
9971,Terry,1,11-Jan-18,,This product keeps my skin so hydrated.
9972,Foxie Lazenby,1,23-Dec-16,,I use this his daily and it s great to keep any razor bumps away in the bikini area. It smells great and keeps my skin smooth
9973,BrittBratt,1,26-Mar-17,One person found this helpful,One of the best face moisturizers ive ever used.. Does not leave a sticky residue in the face Nice An smooth will definitely re purchase
9974,tictac,1,06-Sep-17,,Love the fresh and tingly feel. The face feels fresh and smooth. Love it!
9975,Rica H,1,21-Apr-14,,It feels light and refreshing! It s a little too light for me so I use it with  Garnier Moisture Rescue Lightweight UV Lotion SPF 15   applying the gel before the lotion and its perfect. In the summer however I expect that using the gel by itself wold work too!
9976,Lanitra,1,03-Apr-17,One person found this helpful,I like how you don t have to use a lot but it covers your face but it doesn t feel heavy or greasy.
9977,Courtney Price,1,28-Jul-17,,A little goes a long way  lightweight and dries quickly with out feeling sticky!
9978,Heyjude,1,25-Nov-15,,Didn t really expect too much from yet another beauty product. But this one delivers.........ultra light  non sticky  refreshing  and I actually feel like my skin feels more nourished  in the morning.
9979,Amazon Customer,1,13-Aug-18,,Love the gel texture! This made my face look & feel so smooth. Will purchase again for sure
9980,MrMurphy87,1,25-Aug-15,One person found this helpful,One of my favorites. I have combination skin. Cheeks tend to dry out  but my nose stays oily. I actually keep it in the refrigerator to give my skin a cooling treatment each time I use it.
9981,DAJ1129,1,05-Oct-16,,Purchased for the wife. It was what she wanted and what I ordered at good price (according to the wife).
9982,Kimberly Roldan,1,14-Sep-15,,I bought this because of the reviews  I actually loved this product A LOT. It is very cooling and is not too oily or sticky. It smooth s on to my face and makes it feel like it is actually hydrating it.
9983,Liz,1,19-Aug-18,,Works as well as the more expensive products I ve used. Nice fragrance  feels cool on your skin and is absorbed quickly. I ll order it again.
9984,Jane,1,25-May-18,,Wonderful light gel.
9985,Jane,1,25-May-18,,Wonderful light gel
9986,godfreygirl143,1,09-Feb-13,,I ve never tried this before I bought it here at walgreens.com because of the high reviews. I m glad I did because it s very soothing and makes my face feel very soft. I put it on  rub it in and then use my other cream after a bit on top of it. I ll be using the all the time now. I recommend it.
9987,Cindy,1,29-May-15,,This is a very nice product that I would have probably not bought had I not received a sample in the store. It is a gel which I like because I am not fond of heavy creams that do not absorb quickly. It is light and quickly absorbed with no sticky feel.
9988,Vika,1,08-Oct-17,,I like it  make my skin soft. Good for every day use.
9989,Cathy M. Champney,1,04-Dec-17,,use this daily ..love the feel of it
9990,Raheem Levanti,1,22-Jul-12,,This is not a cream  more of a gel  that when applied to your face does get absorbed surprisingly well and cleanly. Feels good. That said  its less of a stand-alone daily moisturizer (I think) and more of something to use in conjunction with a cream-based daily moisturizer. Still  great product -- feels nice.
9991,robin miller,1,23-Feb-19,,Non-irritating and no dry skin throughout the day
9992,Brandy Mondor,1,26-Apr-19,,Most moisturizers make my face worst because I have very oily skin  but this stuff is awesome
9993,Mimi,1,25-Apr-15,,I really like this face moisturizer. It is like a gel  so nice and light. I order it through Subscribe and Save  so the price is very good. If I feel I need something heavier  I use Cetaphil on top of it.
9994,DigitalAsh,1,15-Oct-15,,I have super sensitive skin  acne/Rosacea and this didn t irritate me at all. It Didn t make me break out and left my skin super soft. I Definitely prefer it over other  more expensive department store brands. This stuff is gonna be a staple in my cabinet
9995,simplyforyou,1,09-Mar-18,,Amazing
9996,Christina,0,19-Oct-17,,Kind of has an alcohol smell I’m not a huge
9997,K. Samenow,1,25-Jul-14,,I liked that there are natural ingredients in this Moisture gel. It s a little different to use a gel instead of a cream  & I m having to get use to it  however it certainly is cooling in our hot  humid summers  & so far I m happy with it.
9998,S. Chow,1,17-Jun-13,,I have a super very dry sensitive skin  I always need to put a thick layer of cream to prevent my face getting dry day and night. BUT  Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream is different. All I need is just a very thin layer will be enough  it keeps my face moist and smooth whole day long. I LOVE IT.
9999,Dora Chaney,1,21-Nov-17,,Works great
10000,Xiaolon s mommy,1,21-Jul-15,,My facial skin is dry and oily. I use this product in summer. It s perfect for my face. The gel is light  and it moistures my face well. Don t expect this can reduce the wrinkle  but it can stop it getting worse. Overall  this product with such a nice price has done a good job for me!
10001,BBG,1,20-May-16,One person found this helpful,Best moisturizer ever. I m a guy and this makes my skin feel nice.
10002,missy richardson,0,29-Sep-17,,people compared it to moisture surge by clinique......did not even come close  did not moisturize my face at all....will not buy again....
10003,Dee,1,20-Dec-15,,Great moisturizer! I love this stuff! Makes my skin so soft and clean! I also love the smell. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with dry skin like mine.

10005,Amazon Customer,0,15-Nov-17,,Used product and did not notice a difference
10006,Sandra Britt,1,30-Apr-17,,Love this moisturizer. You can almost feel your cells soaking up the moisture.
10007,Bulletwings,1,23-Mar-14,One person found this helpful,I LOVE this moisturizer. I have rosacea and my skin jumps back & forth between flaky/dry and oily. The only downside for me is that I go through these jars quick! For about the same amount I think I buy the St. Ives collagen moisturizer and that stuff lasts forever. The thing I love about this moisturizer is that it doesn t feel greasy & doesn t anger my skin. I think I ve used 3-4 jars so far.  It doesn t really feel like it is greatly hydrating me  which is good for the oily parts  but maybe I need a little more moisture for the dryer parts of my face - this is just a theory & coming at the end of winter. I just recently went to the mall & tried a toner for the first time in a bajillion years. I loved it - it felt refreshing & not drying and I think that the moisturizing toner + this moisturizer is the fix that my face needs! Either way  I will continue to use this product.
10008,Lila L. Zucker,1,12-Jun-15,,This is so calming and comfortable on my dry  irritated skin. It s not the most hydrating but I like to use it more like a calming lotion before my standard moisturizer. If you have  normal -oily skin this might be too much for you but I think it d be perfect for people who just have slightly dry skin. It doesn t feel greasy at all (more like gelly water) and soaks in relatively quickly.
10009,AmazonCustomer,1,31-Jul-15,One person found this helpful,I have sensitive skin that gets dry easy. This is the first product I have found that will not irritate my skin and keeps it moist.

10012,Bethany,1,16-Mar-14,,My face used to be so dry that it would peel. I tried everything and nothing worked  until this product!!!!! I m so glad that I finally found something (and cheap) that stopped my face from peeling. It almost worked immediately. VERY HAPPY.
10013,H. Pederson,1,12-Nov-13,36 people found this helpful,Great product that compares to Clinique s moisture surge. i bought this product to try out after using clinique s moisture surge for many years. mostly  i was tired of paying 50 dollars a jar for clinique s product. this product is definitely comparable and way cheaper! definitely recommend
10014,JennJenn,1,06-Dec-13,,This is the lightest feeling and best-smelling moisturizer I have ever used. The texture is absolutely perfect  it did not agitate my hyper-sensitive skin  and it felt refreshing and weightless. It is fantastic for both night and day  and wears beautifully under makeup!
10015,Mountain Girl,1,11-Dec-17,,Awesome
10016,purplepenguins,1,25-Jun-15,,I really like this moisturizer. Its lightweight and different than most. Its a gel that dries clear and non-sticky. Its hard to find  so I applaud Amazon for carrying it!

10020,Jo,1,18-Jul-14,,A little bit goes a long way on this. Nice summer moisturizer  light  doesn t clog up my pores  feels very refreshing and you do not need a lot of it. Will definitely get another jar for the rest of the summer.
10021,Kristine Bolt,1,08-Apr-14,One person found this helpful,I started using this product about 1 1/2 years ago and haven t looked back. It s light so I don t feel like my skin is coated in gunk and my skin feels great. I keep coming back for more.

10024,Amazon Customer,1,07-Jan-15,,My 24 year old daughter loves this product as much as I do. Feels good on the skin; not greasy...but nice and smooth and soaks in very pleasantly. Light fragrance. Perfect skin product
10025,Amazon Customer,1,12-Mar-16,,This is a perfect moisturizer for people who like their face feeling light. Regular creamy lotions make me feel oily and heavy and clogged up  but this hydrates while making my face feel fresh and light  I think I m going to stick to this and never go back to regular lotion
10026,Johnnie P.,1,22-Mar-15,,this stuff is amazing!!! It s so coola nd refreshing and its a gel so theres no sticky or residue left on your skin; i use it daily! It s amazing; gives you such smooth skin!

10033,Jill N,1,04-Apr-15,,Love the light feel of this effective facial gel cream. I mix it with my BB cream during the day if I have somewhere to go  and plain if I m just bopping around  doing errands. It is the best lightweight moisturizer that I ve ever tried  and is especially nice for summer.
10034,Courtney Moore,1,17-Jan-17,,Super moisturizing and has a wonderful cooling effect.

10044,Cassie M.,1,30-Apr-16,,I keep this in my fridge and feels SO good on freshly cleansed skin- esp. in the summer!
10045,E,1,26-Feb-14,,I ve never tried a gel moisturizer before  but thought I would give this a shot. After using it alone a few times  I decided to apply a lotion to my face first because it just wasn t giving me enough moisture. However  my skin is pretty dry these days since it is winter and I will probably use this product without lotion in summer. I feel like the gel definitely  locks in  moisture and leaves my skin feeling smooth.
10046,Alissa,1,10-Dec-15,,Very lightweight moisturizer that feels fresh on your skin. Great for daily use  would not recommend for very dry skin.
10047,Jacqueline S Ellis,1,17-Jan-15,,My acne has gotten better since using this product. I use it as a night cream and as a daily moisturizer. It smells really good and is refreshing. I m hooked.

10049,Dan Curtis,1,11-Mar-15,,This product is fantastic! Living in Denver  dry skin is a huge problem. This product keeps my skin hydrated all day and helps prevent cracks and breaks. I ve used other high end products that cost as much as three times the price and am still more satisfied with Garnier Moisture Rescue. Save your money and buy this instead!
10050,TmJ,1,20-Mar-14,,This is great if you want to moisturize your skin but not make it to look oily. I use this every day after my shower and it s easier to put on than other face things and it smells good...and I m a straight guy.
10051,Edel,1,27-May-14,,I like this moisturizer. It has a very light texture  has a pleasant smell and leaves no residue on my skin  which is a huge plus. If in doubt - give it a go  I think this is an all-around winner
10052,Kelley,1,20-Dec-12,,After reading great reviews  I decided to give this one a shot- I think it s fabulous! It definitely makes the sensitive  dry skin around my eyes feel much more hydrated  supple  and refreshed! it provides a great cooling feeling too.
10053,sandy1,1,15-Jun-19,,Good
10054,The Hadley s,1,26-Jul-14,,Leaves my face feeling moisturized without feeling greasy or sticky (blends well.) It gives it a nice cool aloe feeling. Great when my face gets really dry during winter months.
10055,Tasha,1,22-Jan-17,,This is my first gel textured moisturizer. I was using neutrogena sensitive moisturizer before this  but I didn t like that it left my face feeling sticky afterwards. It did moisturize  but I felt like it wasn t soaking into my skin completely.  I ve been using this for about a week so I don t have a full review on how well it works with time and consistency. It says on the back of the jar to apply twice daily  but I only use this at night before bed.  So far I really like this. It has a slightly cool feeling on the skin and doesn t leave my face feeling greasy/sticky. From what I can tell  it soaks into my skin nicely. My skin feels soft and refreshed. I plan to use it under makeup as well  but I feel like twice daily is a lot for such a little jar. A little goes a long way  but this jar really is small for the price. I m still trying to get used to the gel moisturizer  because the cream is what I was used to.
10056,Arnab,1,03-Sep-14,,I have gifted this item to my dad. He loved it. Especially in humid weather  it keep the skin light and smooth. It does not make the skin sticky or dry. I will buy it again.
10057,Gary Wang,1,03-Feb-18,,as good as expect
10058,S. Levi,0,27-Apr-16,,About 30 seconds after applying this  my skin feels dry and tight again. Not only does this not hold a candle to the product it s trying to imitate but it doesn t even do what it s supposed to do.  I d tried the Clinique version first  ran out  then searched for something similar that didn t cost $50/container. So I tried this. The smell is delightful - a fresh  light cucumber scent that doesn t linger. Lovely. It feels wonderful going on - cool  refreshing. Absorbs nicely  but then... all traces of it disappear. My skin is left as dry as it was before applying. Possibly even worse because then it feels tight. Utterly useless.  If you can afford it  just stick with the Clinique. It works extraordinarily well and a little goes a looooooong way so it lasts forever. This Garnier gel is a terrible product even when NOT being compared to something else. Complete waste of money. At least for me.
10059,Ampersand Man,1,16-May-16,,Smells like aloe vera. Very lightweight  doesn t irritate sensitive skin.
10060,Jerika,1,06-May-14,,It s so extremely light  and just glides on your skin. It s not the best moisturizer for dry spots  but it feels so nice when it s on your skin. Really refreshing  and it feels like there s nothing on.
10061,lori,1,15-Jun-17,,love this
10062,Jillian Nelson,1,25-May-15,,Refreshing and light feel in the skin. Not super moisturizing  but I d recommend for women who do not wear a lot of makeup and don t have dry skin.

10066,Misaki,1,16-Jan-17,,it s good
10067,R. Jones,1,10-Jun-16,,A perfect facial moisture gel. I positively love it. My skin feels great.
10068,Stacy T.,1,29-Jul-15,,I live by this product! So hydrating! I despise any lotion type mpisturizers  as they make me feel oily. About $4 cheaper than average drugstore prices
10069,Dylan Minet,1,04-Feb-15,,This worked very well for me  I m an 18 year old male with oily skin  and this helped me hydrate my skin after successive chemical peels  without making my skin look oily.
10070,Elizabeth,1,22-Oct-15,,This goes on very easily and absorbs into the skin quickly. It leaves you feeling moisturized  but not oily.
10071,Shannon Subers,1,04-Mar-14,,It goes on great  has to go on a clean just washed face or it doesn t feel right. I put it under my face primer and it makes it go on smoother I really like this and it is comparable to more expensive moisturizers I ve used in the past. A little bit goes a long way so it should last.
10072,H. N. MCMAHON,1,29-Apr-16,,The scent is great in the morning; it wakes you up well and refreshes you for the day. Good moisturizer.
10073,ken garcia,1,16-Jun-14,,in this summertime heat my skin gets so oily  this cream helps relieve that oiliness a little bit. it smells very nice too.  unfortunately the cream is not that thick and seems like it doesn t really stick to your skin that well...  it is a cheap product so i guess it is ok for what i paid  the next time around i will be ordering something a little more expensive.
10074,Suzy,1,19-Aug-15,,I have extremely oily skin thats sensitive. Nice and refreshing this doesnt cause my skin to break out and my skin seems to be less oily when use it. Will be repurchasing!!!
10075,Julia,1,13-Jun-14,,Contains many good ingredients for skin. Does not cause irritation or break outs. Their Grape Water version did not work on me but this one is great.
10076,Amazon Customer,1,06-May-16,,Very nice cool feeling gel  absorbs quickly and moisturizes well.

10079,Christina,1,20-Mar-17,,Product was on time and its exactly like its described buying another one BC this is small but worth the money..
10080,EW,1,17-Aug-13,,If you are looking for a good moisturizer this one can t be beat. I use it in the evening and it is cooling  not a bad benefit especially with someone going through hot flashes :)

10086,Camille Maffia,1,28-Jul-15,,bought both dry skin and normal/combo skin and dont see much difference. but what i do know is it makes my face and hands incredibly soft. love garnier.
10087,crystal florian,1,02-Aug-17,,Really liked it
10088,molly,1,05-Nov-13,,cheap and useful for my skin during the summer time. But for fall and winter time  it is not moisture enough. But for the summer time  it is really a good chice for me.
10089,islandgirl,1,29-Nov-16,,Love this! Use very lightly as it doesn t take much to cover.
10090,Carolin Pacheco,1,04-May-14,,This is very good for the money. Keeps my skin moisturized. You do have to use very small amounts and rub it in quite a bit because it is a gel. I recommend it!
10091,ARG,0,23-Jun-14,,This gel-cream is sticky and cold. It was not appealing to wipe on my face. I did not think it provided long-lasting moisture. I would not buy it again.
10092,StormyMorning,1,28-Mar-17,2 people found this helpful,I live in a dry state and it s winter... so even dryer. My T Zone was getting dry and flaky but lotions make my skin feel like its got build up. Got this after a friend suggested it. I love it. Very light. Mildly tingly (trust me do not touch your eye right after applying). My dry skin is gone. And while the tub is tiny it last several months using it day and night. So seems worth it. UPDATE: used continually and just barely ran out. So 5 months of use. Also... don t get in your eyes...
10093,lynn W.,1,11-Nov-15,,This cream just glides on beautifully! Very cooling to the skin also. Love it!

I ve tried Sephora s gel moisturizer and it was NOT worth $20. It did not keep me from getting oily. But this is awesome. It dries very quickly  and you only need a little. I can tell this product is going to last me a long time. Totally worth the money.
10099,Tanner Myers,1,21-Feb-17,,GOOD
10100,pat B,1,07-Oct-16,,This totally works!
10101,J. levy,1,27-Dec-13,,It really works! I very quickly purchased another one. My skin feels smooth and this gel does everything creams are supposed to do  but never do! Buy it!
10102,John Singh,1,26-Jan-14,,Has a momentary cooling effect and hence refreshing. However it is a bit sticky. But does moisturize well. Lasts long as well. I use it occasionally and so I have had it for over a year but the gel looks and feels the same as new  has not changed in color or consistency.
10103,Lyuba,1,08-Sep-15,,it makes your face fresh. smells pleasant  not expensive. good product!

10107,BDaisy,1,27-Jul-15,,I love this lotion! Very light gel with a light smell. Moisturizes perfectly and evenly.
10108,MisMelissaJ,1,04-Mar-14,,I was pleasantly surprised at how well this cream moisturizes  you won t find anything close for the money.... I will be buying again!
10109,beth,1,05-Jun-15,,I have combination skin. My skin is very dry  especially in the winter after washing it. I loved the light gel consistency but I often had to apply it twice.
10110,E. Hottenstein,1,14-Mar-17,,Not greasy at all  very refreshing and absorbs semi-quickly. Reduced redness on my face  love it for the price!
10111,Nicholas,1,12-Nov-16,,Perfect light feel. This saved my face.
10112,snusnumrik,1,01-May-11,One person found this helpful,I live in a very hot and dusty place  and can t stand any da creams on my face if they leave oily feeling on my skin. This product is perfect - it moisturises the sking and leaves absoultely no oily after-effect  this is exactly what I needed. It s almost fragrance-free which is also great. Totally satisfied with the quality  and great value for money. Love it!
10113,jewelre,1,03-Aug-14,,I have oily skin and somehow it doesn t make it oilier. It s not oily nor sticky  it smells nice and left my face feeling smooth.

10116,Audrieloo,1,02-Aug-16,,This stuff is amazing.
10117,Salome,1,30-Jun-13,,Tired the product as living at altitude dries your skin out fast. It moisturizes well without being too greasy to incur breakout. Would purchase again  for sure.
10118,The Wicked Sass,1,19-May-14,,This smells wonderful. It goes on smoothly and dries quickly. It is very moisturizing without being greasy or sticky. Highly recommend.
10119,One busy Nana over here!,1,25-May-16,,This feels lovely on your face
10120,Aubie,1,31-Mar-13,,I use this product all year round because it is a gentle moisture gel that can be used over makeup to freshen up your look..plus I use it on days when I do not want to wear any make and it does just the trick plus it seems to make my skin glow.
10121,Amazon Customer,1,04-Feb-17,,i like it but the quantity is too small. but it s mild and doesn t make my skin irritating
10122,BeccaE,1,06-Jun-14,,Moisterizes without greasy feel completely absorbed into skin. But you will need a sunscreen for day time use. I use Etta MD 46spf.
10123,Catherine G.,1,04-May-14,,This product leaves my face so smooth and soft! I have to restrain myself from putting it on all the time... I may have to repurchase soon.
10124,Katheryn Lee,1,01-May-14,,BEST MOISTURE CREAM IN THE MARKET! I HAVE USED MORE THAN 10 BOTTLES OF THIS WITH MY SISTERS AT HOME. THIS IS THE BEST!
10125,LN,1,26-May-15,,I absolutely DESPISE using lotion because of the sticky feeling it leaves after. However  I have very dry skin  so this poses a problem. I bought this stuff to see if it was any better  and I love it! It feels nice on the skin and dries without leaving any nasty residue behind. I just got it so I m not sure how well of a moisturizer it will be (I have eczema)  but it seems to be helping just from the few times I ve used it. It s a small tub  but a little goes a long way. I use it on patches of dry skin on my arms. I don t know how well it would work as a body lotion because I feel like you d have to use more of it and it d get expensive after a while since the jar is so small. Anyway  I recommend it! It smells nice too.
10126,TP,1,16-Sep-15,,Love Garnier day moisturizer  so figured I d try the night version. Love it
10127,Amazon Customer,1,22-Jan-13,,really great product for my combo skin  but really more for the summer for me. this winter has been a nightmare on my skin. noticeable dry patches on my forehead that this product does nothing for. still my go-to for every other season though.

Now I can find it in the US and online  and I wouldn t go back to my previous cream!

10159,seaparrott,1,06-Mar-17,2 people found this helpful,I ve been using this product for over a year now. I apply it on my face and neck after I shower - my skin has a tendency to get that dry  tight feeling after I wash it. This product is the best moisturizer I ve ever used. What I don t like about normal cream moisturizers is that they leave my face feeling oily or they seem to just sit on top of my skin instead of absorbing. Not this stuff! It smells AWESOME and as soon as I apply it  I feel it absorb and my skin feels soft and glorious. I bought it from Ulta my first time  but I ve been ordering it off Amazon ever since. It always comes well packaged and I ve never received a broken jar.
10160,bomchickawahwah,0,03-Aug-15,,Smells like Garnier hairspray. Could not have it on my face :(

10169,Mia,1,29-Nov-14,,my favorite face lotion ever! feels so good and refreshing :)
10170,Rachel J.,1,18-Feb-15,,I m not giving this five stars because there s a few products that I ADORE and I don t think I adore this one. That said  I m already on my second jar and I m satisfied with it. It s very light (it s gel) and I think I had some issues at first when I was using it with breaking out a bit (I have very sensitive skin but no history of acne -- however  my face just doesn t like a lot of change) but that went away and now I never break out from it. I think I prefer it over cream moisturizers. That said  I still feel like I m on the hunt for the PERFECT moisturizer  but this is a pretty good one for daily use.
10171,AndreaK,1,10-Feb-13,,This is a great and very affordable moisturizer. It soaks in easily and smells good  it is perfect for sensitive skin. I saw results within days.
10172,stevey,1,19-Sep-15,3 people found this helpful,Love this stuff. I have extremely dry skin and this stuff is amazing! It smells ok  a little goes a long way  It makes my skin feel so soft. I tend to get extremely dry skin around my nose  It sucks and looks really bad (embarrassing too) but since I have been using this with my daily/nightly routine I have not had that problem. Although if you have oily skin or combination skin I would stay far away from this it will make you SUPER oily!!!!
10173,Marzena,1,25-Mar-17,,I liked it but to bad they had it only as add on item
10174,Yvonne L. Laconi,1,30-May-13,,I like the lightness of the gel. Doesn t feel heavy or sticky. I will probably be buying this again when I need it

10176,r w,1,12-Jan-15,One person found this helpful,The gel is unique because it easily goes on wet but quickly dries and is absorbed. Not greasy or slippery  and makes those dry cracks go away.

10178,Katie K,1,14-Jul-15,,Really nice stuff!
10179,D.M.,1,27-Jul-12,,This moisturizer has been wonderful! I use it day and night as suggested and leaves my face feeling fresh and soft. It doesnt leave greasy spots and it dries fast (depends how much you put on). Just about a dime size amount works fine with my face (lasts longer too!). I ve been using it for almost two weeks and im still very happy with this product!! :)
10180,Lauren317,1,23-Mar-15,,Light on the skin with a fresh scent. I wouldn t recommend this for anyone with dry skin as it isn t as moisturizing as a cream style moisturizer. I have combination skin and it works great for me in the summer and fall. In the winter I have to use two coats on my T zone to get enough moisture. My only complaint is that I hate the tub. I miss having moisturizers in tubes that were easy to dispense! With tubs I always end up with too much or too little  and if I dip my fingers in I feel like it s getting contaminants in the rest of the product due to having moderately long nails.
10181,Bar,1,03-Jan-16,,Love this product !!
10182,Amazon Customer,1,03-Jan-14,,Fast shipping  I added this on because it had great reviews and I loved it  goes on very smooth and smells so nice  like a mini spa in a jar

10186,JUSTJOY,1,03-Feb-11,5 people found this helpful,So i was looking for a cheaper alternative to my department store brand. I cant say this made my skin super soft  but it did soothe the flakiness i was experiencing. Its very cooling great for the summer. It is very light and smells good. I will probably go back to my department store brand  but if im ever in a finacial bind id probably purchase this again.
10187,Amazon Customer,1,03-Nov-15,,This product is awesome! I struggle with a dry face and this makes it feel so nice and smooth and leaves very little dryness. Better moisturizer than any I have tried to date.
10188,gettingcloserto30woman,1,31-Dec-11,,I m really liking this product. My acne-prone skin did not break out. I have combo skin and since winter is dry  I sometimes add a bit of jojoba oil  and it s perfect  but I usually just leave it as is. Reminds me a lot of Clinique moisture surge gel I used a while back  but much better price.
10189,Rashmi Tuladhar,1,30-Jul-15,,Good product

10196,miles smith,1,17-Mar-14,,very light  cooling  and refreshing. Excellent for summer under makeup. Only negatives would be no spf and has kind of a strong smell - not bad  but if you are sensitive that sort of thing - I wouldn t recommend this one for you.

10200,DW Griffith,1,19-May-17,,I have combo skin with a little bit of breakouts occasionally and some eczema if things get nasty. I use this on the nights I rest my face from glycolic or retin A. Don t let the gel fool you  it s very moisturizing. It s a great all around non offensive skin treat and you can use it morning or night and/or layer under neath a heavier cream  which I do as well. I ve bought so many bottles of it. Also my hub has eczema on his face that gets pretty crazy sometimes but his skin likes this one alot. If you have some skin issues but want a light weight moisturizer  this is it.
10201,R. E. Saunders,1,29-May-14,,A great moisturiser for normal but sensitive skin. I don t need a lot of moisture  just a little barrier to hold in my natural moisture  and this is one of the very few that doesn t give me pimples.

10215,jordan rector,1,19-Dec-13,2 people found this helpful,And I loved it!  I have normal skin  but the winter completely destroys it  leaving it super  super  super dry. My skin is so dry that I feel guilty washing it because it just gets worse. I found this product on amazon and decided to try it out based on the reviews. I don t regret it! I love how it s a gel... It makes me feel like I m not just plastering cream on my skin. It soaks up nicely and makes your skin feel so fresh and clean! Within one use my skin was noticeably smoother and not as dry. It won t be a miracle worker on your first time  but with every day use  your dryness will disappear! I definitely recommend this in addition to any other skin regime you have... I use other acne treatments and I had no problem adding this to my routine!

10220,Marc A. Spence,1,08-Oct-13,2 people found this helpful,Good price. I have issues with psoriasis and this seems to help break outs. I put it on after washing my face and it is very refreshing and has a good smell. I am a guy and this doesn t have a feminine smell. The bottle is small but you only need a little on your fingers. It spreads well and drys quick. I have been using it for over a month and still have a little left

10240,Sharon Gu,1,21-Jan-15,,This cream does what it says. I use it after toners. It moistures your face  makes your face soft  but it is not sticky at all. Good for every season.
10241,Candace,1,19-Jul-15,,Sad that I can t find this in store anymore. I love this as a moisturizer for summer.
10242,JL,1,09-Mar-14,,non grease cream gives skin fresh and cool especially on hot season. but I don t feel the different between dry skin and oil skin product.
10243,diana,1,12-Jul-17,,I have a very dry t-zone and the rest of my face is normal so finding a moisturizer is a hassle but this one works great for me. I previously purchased the one for oily skin and that just dried my face even more and caused me to break out. This one is very gentle on my skin and has improved my dry face and does not clog my pores. Its very light and has a fresh scent  my face has not broken out with this and i have been using it for weeks now.

I ve used the Neutrogena gel moisturizer which I was hoping this compared to that and it s not even close. The Neutrogena one left my skin feeling smooth and soft  this didn t really.
10250,Maria Rodriguez,0,29-Jul-14,One person found this helpful,This product is not for oily skin maybe for dry.The first time I used it looks like I put oil on my face so shiny and the last thing I want for my oily skin is that. Also It doesn t leaves your skin smooth it leaves it sticky. About the refreshing only until it dries. Only thing is good is the smell.

I only used it a few times then threw it out. I have very dry skin and thought this would be great as an add on to my usual creams but it was a dud for me.

10254,OAT,0,11-Jan-15,4 people found this helpful,I have very dry sensitive skin in the winter. I ve used other versions of Garnier moisturizers before  and liked them  so I thought I d try this one for my winter moisturizer. I have never used a moisturizer that is so sticky. The first time I applied it I thought that I must have used too much  and that was why it was sticky. So the second time I used it I did so very sparingly  I don t think I even got enough on to adequately cover my face I put it on so thinly and lightly. However  my face was just as sticky. I tried to wash it off with Cetaphil face wash  and after washing my face two times it was still sticky! I will never use this product again. I m not sure how it got so many good reviews.  EDIT: I wanted to mention something I didn t know before I bought this product: Garnier tests on animals.
10255,JL,1,09-Mar-14,,Non sticky and greasy gel cream gives skin feels fresh and cool. This cream sure let my face feel fresh whole day.

10258,Tara,1,24-Mar-17,,I love love LOVE this moisturizer!!! I have an oily face  so pretty much every moisturizer I use is too heavy  or makes me break out  or makes my face even more shiny. But not this one! My face stays matte all day and when I out it on  it just feels amazing! My whole face feels hydrated and soft. I will never use another moisturizer!
10259,Paula Shin,1,05-May-13,8 people found this helpful,This is THE most hydrating moisturizer that has ever touched my skin. I have sensitive skin  and this does not irritate my skin. Scent is refreshing and mild. I purchase this product over and over. Just wish it came in a pump!

10262,Tiffany,1,24-May-17,,I ve been using this product for about a weke now and have noticed a difference with my face. My face feels softer and smoother to the touch. Its seems that some of my problem acne spots are better as well. It is a great moisturizer for before my makeup and seems to help give me a better finish.
10263,M Crow,0,01-Mar-17,,I heard so many people recommending this product for dry skin but overall I don t love it. I have very dry skin in this desert weather and it just didn t do anything for my dry patches. I also don t love the gel texture - doesn t absorb as well to my skin. I will stick to the face oils  I like acure organics line so far  works better for my skin.
10264,Isaac,1,19-Nov-15,,I absolutely loved this gel! This is for refreshing  while there is another for actual dry skin this one is already so moisturizing without feeling greasy. I have dry skin and don t even need the other kind. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nightly or daily moisture cream.
10265,Jodie,1,25-Oct-14,,Love the way it feels  light and refreshing!
10266,trinyce,1,13-Dec-14,,i like it. its not sticky
10267,Amazon Customer,0,25-Jun-17,,I don t get it. I heard people rave about it so I bought it. It s very liquidy even for a gel. IT does absorb pretty quickly but you can kind of feel it dried on you if that makes sense. I don t think this moisturizes more than any other moisturizer I own.
10268,Nicole,1,03-Jan-16,One person found this helpful,This isn t a hair product as it says . It is a gel cream for your face to lock in moisture. I find it helpful if I use it under my other skin care products .
10269,Amazon Shopper,0,19-Jun-14,One person found this helpful,This moisturizer is sticky  kinda stings  and doesn t moisturize well. After applying a generous amount  my skin is still flaky and dry. Do not recommend.
10270,A*,0,26-Jun-14,,I wanted this to work so badly. I have very dry skin and summer is here. My skin can look just awful in dry heat. This gel has a very cooling feel on the face  love that. In the morning it gives a bit of a wake me up  like all my gels I keep this in the fridge. So the extra bit of coldness is lovely. At first  maybe wishful thinking  I thought this gel was great. It applies really smoothly and sat under my makeup easily. But not even an HOUR would go by and my skin would just look so dull. I changed up the routine  applying this gel directly out of the shower  prepare for work  then applying another layer before I applied my makeup ?- an hour later ?? DULL.  If you have very dry skin  like myself  I can t recommend this product. I am still on the hunt.
10271,Kristina,0,18-Apr-14,,Bought this because it had good reviews. I love the smell  I love the light texture  but not the fact that this stuff made my skin break out. No thank you!
10272,E. Yu,1,13-Nov-13,7 people found this helpful,I have dry skin  and this cream moisturizes ridiculously well for this price point. It also doesn t irritate my sensitive skin. It s a good buy  especially since it doesn t contain parabens.  The gel feels a bit different than creams  but it sinks in quickly. A happy customer!
10273,Glenn Dalton,0,06-Jul-14,One person found this helpful,Really has no active ingredient. It will give you a short burst of hydration  but other than that it s a waste of money. Buy this instead: https://www.scottsmarketplace.com/buy/939/vitamin-c-serum-2oz-advanced-vitamin-c-serum-for-f/

10290,Erin,1,24-Apr-13,17 people found this helpful,I love this moisturizer and like I said  it s been the only kind I ve used consistently for years. I m a cosmetic junky and I m always trying new products  so it s a big deal for me to stick with the same product for a while. I love how it doesn t give me an oily sheen like regular lotion moisturizers do. It really takes down redness and irritation if I exfoliate too much or I had a stubborn pimple. It never makes me breakout and it gives me a really smooth feel. Putting powder foundation on after I apply this is a dream  due to the smoothness it gives me. It s so lightweight and improves my completion. I ll be lost if it ever gets discontinued!

This product is gel-like  smooths on easily & makes your face feel wonderful. It dries quickly & leaves no oily residue or build-up. Smells wonderful too  an herbal fragrance  but not overwhelming. My face feels soft all day. This is wonderful stuff that I would recommend to anyone  especially anyone with problem skin.
10294,Elliott B.,0,15-Jan-11,6 people found this helpful,The description says 6.4 ounces and the price says a little over just one dollar per ounce  which reinforces the impression that we are to receive 6.4 ounces. However  the item I received (from Sam s Online via Amazon) only had 1.7 ounces of moisturizer. I feel ripped off.
10295,Bear,1,12-Sep-17,6 people found this helpful,I ve only been using it a couple of days  but so far it hasn t made me break out  and my dry skin looks soft  smooth and moisturized :) The consistency is like a thin watery clear gel. A little bit goes a long way  I just scoop a little bit on my finger and dab it around my face and then rub it in. It absorbs really fast  and doesn t leave any residue or anything. Also it made my skin burn really weirdly the first time I applied it but only the first time  and it hasn t happened again. I ll update my review if something changes but so far so good  my skin looks great.
10296,Smashley,1,30-Oct-16,One person found this helpful,This is honestly the best facial moisturizer I have ever used!! I started breaking out pretty badly after college  to the point where my entire face was covered in pimples large and small. I had been using CleanNClear moisturizer which always claimed to be non-greasy but was SO thick and heavy that it never properly absorbed - rather  it was sitting on the top layer of my skin  clogging my pores and actually making my acne 100x worse. On humid summer days I would sweat it right out! My sister suggested that I switch to a gel-creme  and when she mentioned Garnier I was dubious about their skin care line. Now I am completely blown away! The gel-cream absorbs very quickly (within 1-2 minutes)  has a fantastic scent (something like cucumber-melon) and the jar lasts a while  you don t need to use a whole lot. My skin transforms overnight everytime I use it!! I had tried so many products that claimed to be gentle  non-comedogenic  lightweight  etc. that only made me dryer or more oily. I will say that it did make my face a bit red during application for the first 4-5 days I used it  as my skin was adapting to it  but that was 5 years ago and I ve been using this ever since. I swear by it  and hope it helps you like it helped me! Garnier please keep this around forever!!
10297,charlotte,0,11-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,This does nothing for my dry skin. I still have dry skin flakes after putting this on my skin. The smell and feeling of the product are amazing and I wish I worked. It is great under makeup because it’s not heavy at all. It may work for people without dry skin or maybe a summer time moisturizer but it does not do the best job to help battling dry skin flakes.
10298,Wylie,0,07-Dec-18,,UPDATED REVIEW: After using this product everyday for about one month  I noticed my skin was starting to show signs of an allergic reaction. I had red blotchy skin that went away as soon as I discontinued using this lotion. Unfortunately it isn t the product for me.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: My skin is like the Sahara desert  and I have tried so many different lotions. My skin is so dry that it ll look flaky even after applying most lotions. Garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue Face Moisturizer (For Dry Skin) really works for me. The gel seems to soak into my skin instantly and doesn t float above the surface like other lotions seem to. Before using this product  I was using Burt s Bees Skin Nourishment Night Cream  but at $18 a pop  I have switched over to Garnier s SkinActive! It works just as well and is much more affordable. Love it.
10299,Sara,1,12-Sep-17,,I have dry sensitive skin and live in Florida. I feel like when I use normal lotion on my face and I walk out into humidity it makes a weird layer on my skin. My roommate got me a travel sized belif gel moisturizer for Christmas. I thought it was amazing but wasn t willing to spend $30 on the full size. My roommate told me there are other gel moisturizers out there (I m not the biggest beauty product person obviously) so I looked one up on Amazon and this came up. It feels just as good as the $30 one and it does have a scent like cucumber which I m usually opposed to but I think it s quite refreshing. Also it doesn t make my face feel clogged or gross when I go outside in Florida humidity.
10300,JJCEO,1,21-Mar-12,8 people found this helpful,My wife uses this to moisturize her face when it is dry. She likes it as it moisturizes her skin without having any oil in the product. It locks in the moisture to help quickly repair dry and damaged skin.  Now comes the confession  I went to a football game last year without a cap and I got my face burned to a crisp. It hurt so bad I couldn t touch my face and it got so dry and started to peel that it really bothered me. I asked my wife if she had anything that could help my cooked face and she handed me the jar of this product. It not only relieved the pain but slowed down the peeling and helped my face to heal faster. The cooling effect of the jell was very good for a badly sunburned face.  Unlike using some sunburn treatments that make your skin feel tight and sticky  this jell just moisturized my skin and made it heal faster and feel better.  I just gave my personal experience as an example of how it helped me in a pretty painful state and if it can help me with my burned face and can imagine what it could do if used on a continuous basis.
10301,Lillaroni,1,05-Apr-18,,I am a 22 year old female with combination skin (oil prone T-zone  normal cheeks). This is the first moisturizer I had ever used that hasn t left my face feeling greasy or weighed down. It was a serious game changer  especially since it is so affordable. After having gone through an entire jar  I feel that I can finally give a solid recommendation for this product. The smell for this product is light and pleasant  and it has a cool  refreshing feeling when you apply it. It doesn t have a creamy or greasy feeling at all. It absorbs fairly quickly  and doesn t leave any tackiness or a film. I also have very fine hair and this doesn t make my hair near my forehead get greasy faster  which is an issue I ve had in the past. As someone that is prone to acne  this product has never caused me to break out. This is a great summer moisturizer  as it is so lightweight  but as a winter moisturizer I find that I need a little more umph. I will definitely be repurchasing this product and I have already recommended it to several friends. **As a note  some of garnier s other moisturizers (I m looking at you  moisture bomb!) have given me burns on my skin. This moisturizer has NOT  so if you have had similar issues with their other products  give this one a try!
10302,Christiane,1,14-Jul-15,,I tend to have oily skin  but I use a really great deep cleansing face wash bar that requires me to use a really good moisturizer to stay clear (african black soap...no really). I have used Clinique s gell moisturizer for several years and I still needed to add a drop of organic jojoba oil to it. Yet I cannot use lotion moisturizers without having acne problems no matter what brand I bought. This stuff is amazing. It has a light scent and it really makes my face so smooth and refreshed day and night. It doesn t cause my acne prone skin to break out and I really do love it. The price is just amazing when you are use to paying department store beauty counter prices. I hope it continues to work wonders on my skin but as of now I have found my perfect  no more acne  system. I went from paying $100 every three months to about $10 and my skin has never looked better.
10303,P. Ferdinand,1,10-Aug-11,2 people found this helpful,I m the type of person who gets bored with products and/or is very particular about what I put on my face. I have acne prone skin  so I m very careful about anything that s heavy or thick or is likely to clog my pores and cause more breakouts. I use acne medication that really dries out my skin. Add to that the dry air this past winter and I looked like a prune. In the space of a few months I suddenly had fine lines around my eyes!  Well  that wouldn t do  obviously. I bought about 5 different products  anything with the word  moisture  or  hydration  in the name. My skin was still dry and some of them gave me zits because they were too thick and heavy and coating. Then I found this gel. Thank God. I just purchased my third container yesterday. That s noteworthy because I usually don t buy anything twice. My skin looks/feels great.  This gel is moisturizing and yet extremely lightweight. I don t feel like I m coating my face with anything that might clog my pores. It leaves no residue or film. It feels like I m putting water in gel form on my face. It s got a nice scent. Sometimes if I m not going out during the day  I ll use this in the daytime too because I like it better than the Moisture Rescue day lotion. The closest thing to it is H20 s Oasis gel moisturizer  but this is 1/3 the price and I feel has more beneficial ingredients in it.  I also use the Moisture Rescue day lotion with SPF (which is lightweight  moisturizing and non-clogging) and I just bought the Moisture Rescue face wash (which feels creamy and non-drying and is awesome). I use a lot of the gel cream so I run out of that more quickly  but a single jar will still last you a decent amount of time  4 months or so. The day lotion lasts a crazy long time. I bought mine in February I think and it s only half gone  although like I said I don t use it every day. You also need to use only a dime size of the face wash and you get a huge tube  so I expect that will last a long time too. For the price  you really can t go wrong.  I m now turned on to Garnier and will be buying their retinol eye cream next :)
10304,Womandragonfly,1,23-Jan-17,,I was looking for something as close as I could get to my  Clinque Moisture Serge Gel Creme  ( I do still love it ) and I think I have found it ! Due to the expense of the @Clinque brand I was forced to do a search for something more affordable. I am glad I did because I found this  SkinActive Moisture Refreshing Gel Creme  All oil free . I prefer fragrance free and this does have a very light refreshing scent that is not bad at all. Works wonderful after my baths and showers . It feels cooling as I use it and a little goes a long way.I am very pleased with this product.
10305,Tara Anna,1,22-Apr-17,,Love  love  love this stuff. I purchased this and Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream ( $16 for same 1.7oz jar ) and honestly I prefer this. I feel like it does just as good of a job plus it smells nice and has a better price point. I don t feel the Neutrogena is worth the extra $10 per jar. I would highly recommend this stuff. I use Retin A on my face daily and it really dries my skin out  this Gel Cream keeps my face moisturized and soft. I apply it 2-3 times a day and it doesn t make my face greasy or sticky like other moisturizers I ve tried.
10306,SimplySusie,1,07-Jul-15,,Humid New Orleans summer weather + makeup = embarrassing greasy look. I searched for an oil-free moisturizer because my makeup slid off my face in the steamy weather. I have combination skin with a seriously oily T-zone. I have some pricy moisturizers  not oil-free  that I put away since I purchased this Garnier Gel-cream. Using this with a primer  also oil-free  has helped keep my makeup intact. The product is a thin gel with a smell that disappears after applying. It s a little sticky upon application  but dries fast and smooth. I didn t expect this product to be so good  because of the cheap price  but it goes to show high end products aren t always the answer. I gave it four stars because of the packaging. Kind of a weird surprise upon opening and saw the jar is only as big as the picture  not the box it comes in.
10307,Caitlin Moore,0,12-Oct-16,3 people found this helpful,I saw the great reviews and thought I d give it a try. I was in need of a moisturizer and liked this one because it was a gel cream. Most cream/lotion moisturizers are too heavy for me and clog my pores  so I was excited to try this out. However  I haven t had good results from this gel moisturizer. Right off the bat  it did not feel moisturizing going on. It literally felt like I was rubbing hair gel on my face. It s not sticky  but it did leave my face feeling a bit tight and stretched. Not only that  but it actually made my skin feel dryer afterwards. My chin area was especially dry and irritated. I also noticed an increase in noticeable blackheads  and my cystic acne which had actually been cleared up for a while  came back full flare. It might work great for a lot of people  just not me. Unfortunately I have very finnicky skin =/
10308,HAUNTRESS,1,19-Sep-17,,I am in my 50 s and having a hard time finding a nighttime cream or moisturizer that won t either dry my skin out or not absorb all the way and make my face feel sticky or gummy after applying it. I thought I d give this is a try and to be honest  I wasn t expecting much from it. But I have to say after using it for a couple of weeks  I m VERY impressed and surprised! The product goes on easily  the smell is not overpowering  and when it dries on my face it makes my skin feel nice and smooth.
10309,Melanie,1,03-Jan-16,,My face had recently been so dry that my forehead  nose  cheeks  etc were all flaking. I exfoliated and washed and exfoliated  but nothing was helping and my current facial lotion wasn t working either. I just bought this product yesterday and I already have no flakes! My acne also seems to be healing better with the use of this product  and my skin generally looks brighter and healthier.  Pros: -A little goes a long way. Just a little dab can cover your whole face! -Very refreshing. -It works!  Con: -I only have one: stickiness. It does feel a tiny bit sticky on the hands/fingers and face after application. Washing my hands is an easy fix and the stickiness on the face almost feels like a firmness  which could be nice.  Notes: -There is a fragrance. I didn t even notice the fragrance until I read other reviews  so I personally did not find it strong at all. Artificial smells like candles and perfumes make me very sick  so the fact that this product doesn t make me sick should mean it doesn t smell very strongly at all. It s a light fruity smell and I have to take a big whiff from the container to smell it--I can t smell it from it being on my face.  I will definitely buy again!
10310,RLuna,1,27-Nov-18,,I love this moisturizer. I live in a REALLY dry climate; next to 0 humidity every day and winters are the worst! My skin was desperate for something to relieve the dry  itchy feeling. But I needed something affordable. I use this along with Cerave Moisturizing lotion and Nutrogena Hydro blast foundation. My skin looks and feels incredible.
10311,Sarah A. Manning,1,28-Feb-15,4 people found this helpful,After reading the review of this product  I finally made the purchase and for the most part  I really like this gel-creme moisturizer. This winter has been extremely damaging to my skin and I found that no matter what I purchased  I still had flaking occurring on my forehead  nose  and the apples of my cheeks. I have to note that I haven t found quite the right cleanser yet  so I m sure that doesn t help. Anyway  this product is amazing. I even just touched my cheek and found it to be so soft and smooth even though I haven t applied this since last night. When I was skimming through the reviews on my search for the  Review this Product  button  I saw someone mention that using this product feels like slathering water on your skin and I have to agree. It s cool and refreshing and so light. A little goes a LONG way.  My ONLY drawback is the scent. I really  REALLY wish that these was zero fragrance but I guess I m stuck with it. It s pretty light and doesn t seem to irritate my skin but I hate floral scents.
10312,Christina S.,1,04-Apr-15,,As a note  I did not pay for this - my bf bought it for himself(but didn t like it) and I would describe myself as having normal/dry skin  not combination. That being said  I think it works ok. I would not buy it for myself  but I found it to be adequately moisturizing  especially if there is a lot of humidity. It s generally between 25%-60% humidity here  so on the more humid days  this works just fine. On the less humid ones  it s not really moisturizing enough for my drier skin. I was only using it at night  after cleansing. I like that it has no smell though- garnier products often are full of irritating fragrances.  One thing to note though  if you have sensitive skin- I used this after exfoliating a few times and it burned like crazy. I m never doing that again.
10313,Brother,1,08-Oct-17,One person found this helpful,The only moisturizer that doesn t get stuck in my beard! As a hairy man with dry skin  the majority of moisturizers leave gnarly white residues in my beard and hair. This Garnier gel goes on clear and disappears like magic  effectively treating the dryness and leaving my face refreshed. Totally recommended for men and women with hairy faces!
10314,MBrown,1,08-Jul-11,,I have really oily skin  so I have always steered clear of moisturizers on my face  as I don t need any more help in the shine department. I saw an coupon for this in the Sunday paper  and was intrigued because it was a gel  and I had heard gel moisturizers are great for oily skin.  I picked myself up a jar of this and tried it... It worked just like it claims. It felt very refreshing and glided on my skin like silk  quick to absorb  and NO oily feeling and no residue left behind. It smells FANTASTIC. I just can t get enough of the scent.. I wish it was just a bit stronger so I wasn t the only one who could smell it. In fact  I wish they d use this scent in all their products  or even have a body spray of it. It s light  refreshing  and clean smelling.  The price can t be beat for a product of this high quality. Why spend big bucks when this works beautifully? I can t wait to try their other skin care products if this one is so fabulous.  Update: It appears they changed the formula when they changed the label. It smells bad now  whereas I used to love the scent so much  I would have bathed in it! I hate the scent so much now that I can t use it. Bummer!
10315,Wolfen69,1,13-Jun-15,,I had some of the driest facial skin one can imagine. Redness  major flaking  etc.... I was ready to go to the doctor for to get help. Thought I would try this Garnier stuff. To put it bluntly  it worked a miracle on my skin. I now have a perfect complexion once again. My skin hasn t looked this good in many years. I often get comments how good it looks.  Don t be fooled by how small the container is. 1.7oz. will last a long time  as only a small dab is needed to cover a good sized area. I m guessing I ll get 2 months from this using it twice a day. Well worth the money. I use it on my face  but I m guessing it will work on other problem areas also. Anything that can save me a doctors visit is worth its weight in gold to me.
10316,shopaholic mom,1,16-Apr-13,3 people found this helpful,For me this is just about the perfect moisturizer. The gel formula is amazing!! I live in the hot  sunny  sweaty desert and this moisturizes my skin without making it greasy or shiny. It is perfect for the summer months. The gel absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves it feeling super soft without feeling like an oil slick. Also I have not broken out while using this moisturizer at all. If you have combination or oily skin this is pretty much the perfect product for you. I cannot say enough about how great it is. The best part is costs peanuts compared to all the high end products that do not even work as well. Give this a try...you will love it!!
10317,A. Nichols,1,08-Dec-12,,My skin is extremely dry during the winter months and every year I struggle with the top and bottom of my eye lids cracking. Also my forehead is very dry but it doesn t crack  the skin just feels very rough. I was looking for a product that didn t break the bank but still helped my issue. The only other product that I ve found to heal my dry skin was vaseline  and I didn t want to trade dry skin for acne so I started looking for something else. Within the first 3-4 days I noticed a big change in the dry skin on my forehead  and my eye lids were starting to heal. Mind you  for the first day or two as soon as my skin would soak up the gel-cream I would reapply it. The gel-cream is very off putting at first but I don t care about how weird it is/feels now because my skin is completely hydrated. This product is awesome and I will continue to buy it!!
10318,Grassshopper021,1,28-Jun-16,One person found this helpful,I have been using this stuff for years. Here s why:  1-I have rosacea and it doesn t flair it up at all. 2-I have skin allergies and it doesn t bother those either 3-The smell is very faint and not noticeable 4-This does not leave your skin feeling oily at all 5-I actually put this on top of my makeup powder. Rubbing it on doesn t remove the makeup  just gives you a more moisturized look  A+
10319,PP,1,24-Mar-19,,I ve been using this for the last one week and have been loving it. I developed dry patches on my face this winter after my baby was born and have been struggling to find a face cream that moisturizes my skin without making it feel greasy and oily  and stays for at least a few hours. I tried a few creams  moisturizers  gels but nothing worked before this one. I like how light it feels on my skin and how long it stays. Hoping this is going to become my new staple face cream.
10320,Radishgirrrl,1,06-Jul-14,,Bought this at General Dollar on a whim (Amazon is cheaper  will buy it here from now on) and I have to say this stuff is incredible. I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily and haven t had any problems using this gel. I m also prone to headaches and stuffiness from most scents  but even though this product has a scent (kind of like Jean Nate) it hasn t bothered me. Might have to try Jean Nate next!  As for moisturizing  it  s perfect for me. I m 52 and my skin is all over the place  dry  normal and oil and the gel soothes the dryness and mattifies the oiliness. I have been using Rimmel 25-hour foundation because I love the gel-like qualities it has  filling in those little lines and wrinkles and firming the skin up a bit  but it breaks me out. Nonetheless  I kept using it because I liked what it did for my skin. Now that I ve experienced this product  I ll be foregoing the Rimmel and using the Garnier gel as a moisturizing primer under my cream foundation (Covergirl and Olay Simply Ageless) ... I love this foundation  but it does not glide on well and can go on heavy if you aren t very  very careful. It doesn t break me out  either  I can actually sleep in it. But it works and applies oh so perfectly with this Garnier gel under it. The lines  wrinkles fill in and the skin looks tighter.  May try it on my body next.  So  buy it and try it. You might be like me who absolutely loves it!
10321,krod119,1,29-Apr-18,,I’ve been using this product for about 6 months and I love it! I have very oily skin  so most moisturizers make the problem even worse. This one feels so refreshing and dries matte. I use it morning and night and I can’t believe the difference it has made. It’s also so inexpensive! The only problem is it seems to evaporate so one day you’ll open the bottle and it’ll be almost empty. This seems to happen when you’re close to empty anyway so it’s not much of a loss  but it’s still a little disappointing
10322,Kate,1,29-Nov-13,21 people found this helpful,Pros: -Lightweight  do not have to use a lot of product to cover one area -Non oily and won t make you break out -Evens out complexion  Cons: -Heavy floral scent. It isn t a bad scent  it s just overpowering at first. I got use to it and it s not so bad now. -Doesn t wash off well  but I ended up liking that so it moisturizes all day.  At first I wasn t too impressed by this product  but I ve been using it for two weeks and I m starting to see my complexion even out. My skin is glowing and I don t have as many breakouts. Also  dark spots and blotchy-ness is reduced. Granted  Clinique Moisture Surge is the king of all moisturizers in my opinion  but this is a nice product in comparison to price. It does take a bit of time for it to take effect and moisturize your face. If you want something lightweight  that won t make you breakout then this is your product!
10323,She,1,15-May-13,,bought this cream gel at target after reading all the comments here...I used youth code from loreal last month but it clog my pores and gave me millions of acne which I fought like world war 3 goshhhhhhhh then I decided to changed it and got this one  every morning and b4 bed time I washed my face with Aveeno cleansing bar anti-blemish bar soap then rinse it off then I use cotton balls to clean excess dirt and dries skin then I put proactive treatment cream let it dry then I put this cream I feel so fresh and very light to my skin i work 8 hours but still my skin feel soft and fresh after work..so far so good...and take note if you are not working 8 hours under the sun do not use sunscreen because it will darken your skin clog your pores and more oily skin.so I recommend this product to those people that don t like oily moisturizer light and don t like clog pores.
10324,Butters,1,25-Sep-16,One person found this helpful,37 yo female of part middle east extraction. I have combination skin (oily t-zone  occassional dryness around laugh lines and under eyes  and occassional acne near jawline). This product balances everything out. I found this Moisture Rescue gel after looking for a product similar to clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel  which is way too expensive for me  but has great reviews. This product came up in my search results. I love this garnier moisture rescue gel..it is like nothing I ve tried before. I have tried all types of  oil free  moisturizers and almost all of them left behind a tacky or sticky residue that I felt after just 2 hours. Much worse if spf included. This gel formula leaves no greasy residue behind and it just absorbs into my skin. And I think it actually controls the oiliness on my t-zone. It takes about 20 seconds to absorb into my skin. No shininess after it absorbs. My skin just feels softer. Texture is very pleasant...has a cooling/soothing effect on my skin. Scent is refreshing. I use a gentle face wash  witch hazel toner  and this moisturizer  and my skin finally feels balanced. Great buy! I suggest adding an spf product if you will be outside more than 20 mins  especially around the eyes.
10325,Amy Gordon,1,10-Jan-16,,Really impressed with this moisturizer. It s light and not heavy  sticky. I believe a little goes a long way because the size of the jar is particularly on the small side. So I just used a really small amount (like a pinky finger nail size) and I only used the product around my eyes after I showered. At first  the gel-cream seemed to leave a slight residue on my skin  but after about five minutes  I felt my skin again and the residue was soaked into my skin leaving it smooth and not irritated. I have slight to mild acne  as well as an oily and dry completion. I really like this product for the quality and the price  and a small dab of the gel-cream does amazing work!!
10326,Alyssa,1,19-Sep-17,,I love it! I ve been using it for a couple years after looking for a dupe to replace my Olay Dew Over moisturizer. It s the only skin product i ve ever owned that makes a difference right away and doesn t irritate my sensitive skin. I ve found the best way to use it is to put on a dab the size of a small grape  smooth it over your face and neck  and give it a few minutes to soak in. It will feel like you re using aloe gel  and it doesn t rub in immediately  but the results are amazing and totally worth the few minutes of waiting. Great for soothing your skin after a long day of wearing makeup. You will feel as smooth as a baby s butt.  I ve repurchased about 3 times. IT LASTS FOREVER.
10327,Jill,1,01-Nov-14,,This is the only moisturizer I ve ever loved  and the only one I will ever use for as long as they keep making it (please don t ever stop making it!!). It s so so light  not greasy in the least  and after you apply it  it almost feels like you didn t use any product at all  like your skin is just naturally hydrated and fresh  if that makes sense. The only thing that could be considered a downside is the fragrance  if you don t care for it. It smells kind of fake-apple-y...But it goes away pretty quickly after you apply it  and if you like the way their shampoo smells (I do :) )  it probably won t bother you.
10328,S. Lee,0,06-Feb-15,3 people found this helpful,I m in mid 40s and have pretty good skin but I live in S Cal so the weather can be pretty dry here. I didn t even finish using this and threw out the rest. After using this on my face  it was still dry and felt like it was pulling. I had to put on my trust Cetaphil so I can move my face again.  Maybe ok for teens and 20 s skin but even in your late 30s you should get more moisture.
10329,Claudia Waid,1,20-Feb-18,,Okay.. I don’t ever do reviews  like ever. But I feel like this product deserves it. I have extremely dry skin. There’s no oil in my skin whatsoever. I don’t have acne  just dry patches and flaky skin. I’ve been like that my whole life. I’ve tried countless products  low end to high end. I bought this on a whim. Got home and took my makeup off for the day  this is the only product I put on after washing my face. Went to bed. I woke up and my skin was SO plump and So hydrated. I literally feel like a new person. Not only does my skin look better  but it feels better also. For only $7 I will continue to repurchase  you can count on that.
10330,Skin Care Junkie,1,30-Jul-15,,This is a very nice lightweight moisturizer and also smells nice. This does not leave me feeling uncomfortable or oily. I only use this at night because it does not contain SPF however  you can always apply this under a SPF product. I just wear a moisturizer with SPF included  alone in the morning. I have oily to combination skin and I use the green on in the summer time and I use the pink one for dry skin in the winter time. Very good price for the amount that you get in the jar  it will last you through the season.
10331,Humble Scholar,1,15-Feb-16,,I really love this gel moisturizer. It s light  smells nice  doesn t go on greasy or slimy. Just a nice light well made moisturizer for daytime. I use this daily. I typically like Garnier products  they seem to be well made. And deliver on what they say. I use the BB cream  the shampoo and conditioner  and the oil cleanser as well. I m happy with them all. I would definitely recommend.  I have NOT been paid  received any products nor solicited for my review.
10332,Kandrea,1,18-Jun-14,,I recently was prescribed Differin (a retinoid) by my dermatologist and my skin was unbelievably dry and flaky. None of my regular moisturizers had any effect on my peeling skin but after only one use of this gel I could tell a huge difference! My skin felt moisturized all day and the flakiness was totally gone by the next day. Not only that  this product is oil free and non-comedogenic so it s perfect for acne prone skin. Whatever is in this moisturizer is amazing  I might even go as far as to say this is a miracle product. I highly recommend for very dry skin  but this works for all skin types as well because it is not greasy.
10333,A3019,1,10-Apr-15,,I m one of the people who s skin reacts really good to Garnier. I used to use the green gel-cream when I was younger and somehow moved on to other creams (didn t it disappear for a while?) when I spotted this one on Amazon recently. Just received it and can say that it s very good for dry skin  I put it on in the morning and my skin was still fresh looking in the evening. I had a day off so I didn t use any makeup. It s more penetrating than the green gel-cream from what I remember plus my skin is way more dry now. Glad I found it again!
10334,Peggy Hense Hardwig,1,28-Aug-17,,I ve never written a review for anything before but I couldn t not write one for this product. I have super acne prone skin and I ve been on accutane multiple times to try to get rid of the acne. on my flakiest dry skin days  this moisturizer completely solves the problem  and leaves my skin looking fresh and soft. it can handle anything from slightly dry skin to accutane skin that has 0 moisture left in it at all. not only does it get rid of horribly dry skin  but it has never once led to any acne breakouts or other skin issues. if I could give this product 10 stars I would. buy this.
10335,Tara Jean,0,22-Aug-17,,I personally didn t care for this product even though I like many Garnier products. The gel (pink or green  I tried both) wasn t hydrating enough for me and normally gels aren t.I also didn t care for the jello-type texture lol. I decided my skin is better with lotion or creams. This may be great for someone who is very oily.
10336,trippind27,1,03-Dec-15,,My skin gets flaky especially during the winter & I was using Cliniques moisture surge  but I had ran out & was low on funds. I originally found this at dollar general & decided to try it. I m glad I did. It works just as good for a lot less money. The only differences are the color & this has a light floral scent. I usually like unscented creams b/c certain smells trigger headaches but this doesn t do that. The scent is really light & doesn t linger like some other creams.
10337,Svitlana S.,1,08-Apr-15,6 people found this helpful,A very light texture. It has a light pleasant smell and feels so good on skin. NOT oily nor sticky. Simply amazing. I ve bought one just to try but I definitely had to buy double pack better.
10338,Samantha R.,1,25-Oct-17,,Amazing. I have kind of dry skin but in some spots it is oily. This is the best moistureizer I have ever used. I used after I wash my face before bed  I used it after waxing and I have perfectly clear skin in the morning  and I use before I apply my makeup primer. Love it.
10339,ally,1,01-Sep-13,,I just got this today  even before looking at any of the reviews (after I purchased it  before I used it)  it was love at first sight in the drug store. I have oily skin  and I have yet to find a gel moisturizer I was ready to commit to. I has tried high end samples from everywhere  and nothing did the job. The scent of this product is very light  I can barely smell it. If you re not one for scents  it s not overwhelming at all. I don t mind my products having a little scent to them  and this one smells  fresh   that is the only way I can really describe it. It s VERY refreshing to put on  especially after using my Clarisonic. I use my rose water toner  serum  argan oil  then this! I was so impressed with how it made my face feel. I always struggle with moisturizers making me look too oily  and it feels gross. After about 5 minutes  it really sinks it and settles nicely. I also don t wear a lot of make-up  but if I were to...it would make the perfect canvas for it. It s so smooth and radiant. LOVE LOVE LOVE!
10340,Ivy L,0,03-Oct-14,One person found this helpful,After reading many good reviews from many sites  I opted to try this moisture out even though I already have a decent Clean & Clear Moisturizer. This Garnier Moisturizer is just a dollar or so more expensive than the other one. Unfortunately  this product did not work for me. I have naturally super oily skin  and it made my face worse  more oil than my natural oil. I hated it and wanted to return right away  but I finished the whole product to avoid the hassle. The amount compared to the other is less as well. It only last me about 2.5 months. I do not recommend for oily skin. I only use it night time because it makes my face looks really oily and cakey.
10341,HK,1,14-May-19,,Great non-greasy moisturizer. This hydrates well. My only complaint is that you don t get much in the package. Lasts me about a month.
10342,Elizabeth LePage,1,27-Jan-17,,Oily/dry flaky skin: nose  under nose  chin  forehead  eyebrows  lips  and even nostrils  Oily skin that cannot use typical hand lotions: this gel moisturizer works wonders on dry patches of skin.  Does not leave any residue (sticky or otherwise). Can reapply as needed. Very cooling to a sunburn on the face.
10343,BleauGene,1,30-Jan-17,,this has been my go-to for months! ive tried both the normal and dry skin formula. love them both. this is probably the first face product that ive used all of it like literally scraped the bottom. and i love that it s in a pot because you can get all of it out  nothing to get stuck in a tube. doesn t dry sticky. is smooth and moisturizing without any greasy feeling. absorbs fast and wears great under makeup.
10344,Tarun Gudipaty,1,09-Sep-18,,My wife says  It feels so light yet so effective. I am usually very wary of using new products on my skin. But this has worked wonders .
10345,Bree,0,18-Jan-18,,This broke my face out. In the ingredient list it has DIMETHICONE fairly near the top. That is a type of silicone that can clog pores. It also did not moisturize at all  it did nothing in that regard except make my face wet. It did not sink in and truly moisturize.
10346,Zelda s stuff,1,18-Mar-18,,This is heaven in a jar. Moisturizes my skin so well. I use it before bed and in the morning under make-up. The smell is fresh and clean and not overwhelming. I can t go to bed without it now.
10347,Cathy,1,29-Mar-14,,I just purchased this a few weeks ago and I love it. I am in my early 50 s and have sensitive skin and rosacea. This stuff has not broken me out at all and my face isn t quite as flaming red as it usually is. It takes very little to glide on over my face and neck and provides a great makeup base for my foundation. It is not greasy and sinks right in. This is great for combination or normal/dry skin. It feels cooling to my skin. I will definitely buy this again.
10348,Jasper,1,13-Jul-17,,It s more like a gel than a cream to me. It s very refreshing and very light. It s not sticky at all after applying. You don t need a lot. I put my bottle in the fridge. I like the feeling of applying cold gel onto my face at the end of the day. The price is right.
10349,HellCat,1,11-Oct-14,,This stuff is amazing!  And it smells great! I have very dry skin  and hate the way lotion feels on my face. I especially hate the way dirt and such sticks on my skin because of lotion. Even riding over 80 miles in 90 degree weather on my motorcycle after applying this gel in the morning  there was little to no road dirt/dust sticking to my face. Besides that it s so lightweight I didn t sweat it off either.
10350,Alexis,1,10-Jun-13,,Wow I can truly say that this product works wonders. When I say that I have tried everything I mean EVERYTHING. I have EXTREMELY oily and sensitive skin to the point where products such as Aveeno  Cetaphil  Olay  Neutrogena....etc have only caused me to break out every time. I m allergic to products with nuts in them such as coconut or cocoa or shea so to find something that I can apply daily w/o having to run and immediately wash it off or wake up with bumps all over my face feels so nice.
10351,Techsavvy25,1,23-Oct-17,,This product is very refreshing to the skin. It provides a great amount of moisture but I also had some peeling skin from it. I am not sure if that is apart of the process.

This moisturizer takes care of both qualities of my skin! I ve been using the Garnier Moisture Rescue Gel in conjunction with the Brusher Cleanser Gel and my skin feels soft and amazing! Highly recommended!
10353,Devourr,1,18-Jun-12,3 people found this helpful,I have tried countless moisturizers and creams  and never found anything that worked with my very sensitive  very dry skin. Nearly everything in the past has left my skin both still dry  and broken out (which is insanely frustrating because without a moisturizer  my skin is dry but never breaks out.) When I found this product I was literally ready to give up on moisturizers all together  but this gel-creme is a miracle! It dries super quickly and goes on very lightly  leaving no oily feeling. Since my skin is so dry I like to apply one layer  let it dry  and then add a second. I use this both at night and in the morning  and I m in love  super moisturized skin and absolutely no breakouts or red spots  this stuff is amazing!
10354,Arsk92,1,06-Oct-17,,This stuff is so soft it s incredible. The pink one is even softer if your looking for an even better product at the same price! Very small amount though. Wish they sold a bigger jar.
10355,Lovely,1,20-Jan-15,,I ve been using this for about 6 months now and I just love it. It s light  airy  has a slight cooling effect  and even brightens my skin a little. I use it in the morning and at night. It really is a cross between a gel and creme. Despite the color  it is a translucent color when applied to the skin. It comes in a rather small jar  but it lasts a really long time.
10356,Amazon Customer,0,17-Dec-16,2 people found this helpful,I used this product right before bed as my new moisturizer  the next morning I woke up with worst break outs I ve ever had. This was the only product I changed in my skin care routine and I did not eat anything out of my regular meal plan. I would not recommend this to anyone with sensitive oily skin.
10357,Betty Bear Lover,1,12-May-17,,Love love this product  especially for firming (neck area and under eyes). Gives a bit of a lift  and has a fresh light scent. Can t seem to find in local stores  happy to get it here. Lasts a long time and doesn t dry out.
10358,pandur,1,08-Jan-13,2 people found this helpful,Another great Garnier product! This stuff leaves my face feeling hydrated  clean & soft. I have really dry  sensitive & fair skin. I use to use garnier lotion moisturizer which works really well  but this works soooo much better for my skin. Usually after I put on blush or powder my face looks a little bit chalky on some areas. So  I just use a pea size amount to smooth on my hands then dab on the dry areas. I usually use this before I put make up on too and it makes it look much smoother. It feels great when you put it on too. Nice cooling feeling and not sticky or anything. I have used severeal of garniers face products and they all work great on my skin. My husband also uses there products. He use to have horrible  I mean  really bad acne a few years ago. Their face scrub helped him a ton!!! I highly recommend any of their other face products. I have used most of them and loved them all. The only ones I haven t tried are their anti-aging products.
10359,Jennifer,1,17-Nov-17,,This is an awesome  light-weight moisturizer. I have oily skin and it does the trick. A little goes a long way and that is an even more awesome feature.
10360,mymaryjanes,1,23-Dec-12,3 people found this helpful,I have sensitive combination skin. I am passionate about skin care. I bought this product because I wanted a light moisturizer with Vitamin E  to use beneath my sunscreen.  The ingredients in this gel-cream are not very impressive. Vitamin E is pretty low on the list; it seems to be mostly water and silicone. The name   gel-cream  is really just a gimmick; it appears to be a translucent  watery lotion. By  refreshing   I am guessing they mean  cooling ; the high amount of alcohol cools the skin as it evaporates. That much alcohol can also be drying over time. I found that the glycerin in this product left my skin feeling kind of tacky  and looking shiny  after use  but did not provide much moisture.  Overall this isn t much of a moisturizer. As it has no SPF  I can t imagine why someone with oily skin would need it (as a sunscreen would be enough for them) and I can t see a person with dry or combination skin liking it either. It is just okay for use under sunscreen; eventually  as the weather became colder and dryer  I began adding a few drops of Vitamin E to make it more moisturizing  so I can use up this jar. I won t repurchase.

The only good thing about this product was the scent. Never again!!
10362,Alli Browning,1,28-Oct-17,,Have really enjoyed this product. I was afraid that since it was more a gel texture than lotion it would leave my face feeling sticky  but it hasn’t.
10363,Kelly B.,1,31-Dec-11,5 people found this helpful,This gel-cream is not really a cream  but pretty much just a green gel. Not to say that it doesn t work well  though. My skin type is normal  but I do get oilier patches in the summer and drier patches in the winter. What I would recommend this moisturizer for is mainly for the summertime only. I found the lightness and coolness of the gel to be refreshing on sunburnt and oily skin. As for performing in the winter time  I don t think it s enough to cure dry skin. I m having to moisturize twice a day now  and I still have patches of dry skin. So really  this is a product for people with oily skin or for those whose skin gets oilier in the winter. Because it s just not creamy enough to attack dry skin  but it s light and airy enough to sit on oily skin.  Also  for those who are wondering  the smell of the gel isn t too strong. It just smells like grape seeds.
10364,Demi,1,15-Feb-17,,This moisturizer gives you a cooling sensation when applied. I did have a problem with my face getting patches and flaking. I m not sure if it s the moisturizer or just the weather reacting with my skin. I did try returning this product and was offered a refund without having to return it.
10365,BetaLyrae,1,26-Oct-16,,The gel gets absorbed very quickly by the skin and leaves it feeling smooth and moisture-replenished with no oily residue or shine. Also  it has a very pleasant but not overpowering fresh scent. Great value  will definitely buy it again and again!
10366,Texas mom,1,18-Jun-18,,I love how this product feels on my face  very clean and light yet very moisturizing.
10367,April McPeek,1,17-Apr-19,,Nice product but skin seemed oilier than usual.
10368,jack147,1,14-Feb-18,,Like this moisturizer for using before I put my makeup on. Dries non-sticky or greezy.
10369,mirabelle,1,29-Sep-12,4 people found this helpful,I think it works well as a summer moisturizer  as I have combination skin which is usually a little oily during this time. I also have very sensitive  acne prone skin like many others  and this product did not break me out or cause any negative reactions. I don t think it is miraculous like some reviewers do  but I like it and will most likely to purchase it again. However  since the season is changing again  and it s getting a little chilly at where I live (50~60 degrees)  I have noticed that it s not enough for my skin. I usually use something heavier in winter anyway  so I ll recommend this for summer use. On the side note  while this product being cheap  I don t think it lasts for a long time. I use it with my boyfriend  we each use this gel-cream once a day  and it s running out after a month. My boyfriend is telling me to get another jar  and likes how lightweight this moisturizer is. Ha  and he never liked putting anything on his face.
10370,Sam M.,0,29-Jun-15,,Not at all moisturizing. Heavily fragranced. Has SD alcohol as the third ingredient. This stuff is gross. No matter how little or how much I use it leaves a sticky film on he skin. Then it balls up and rubs off in clumps if you try to use makeup on it.
10371,indiangirl,1,11-Aug-14,,Do not keep creams & makeup sitting on ur skin for 24hrs ?? I like this moisturizer due to it s scent & fast absorbency rate. A little goes a long way. I did have to reapply after 6-8hrs. I have dry  flaky skin on my T-zone. This is not at all greasy. I don t know if it would break you out but it didn t for me.
10372,Sunny,1,14-May-17,,This cream is so gentle and refreshing on my skin. My skin is oily  but this gel cream helps control the oil so I do not get oily during the day and it moisturizes my skin at the same time. Aside from the fact I wish it had spf  this product is amazing. I love it!
10373,Doglover1111,1,24-Feb-15,,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this. My daughter borrowed my Clinque moisture surge  and I just order this on a lighting deal  and feel it is very similar to the much more expensive product. Probably not deep moisturizing  but feels nice going on  and relieves facial dryness.

10375,Jackie Winfree,1,03-Apr-15,,I got this on sale for $5.79 not expecting much  and boy was I surprised. I have sensitive oily skin  so finding a good  reasonably priced night moisturizer that doesn t cause breakouts feels like an impossible task. This one feels light going on and doesn t turn my face into an oil slick overnight. I tend to avoid gel-based anything I put on my face  but this doesn t feel sticky or greasy once I massage it in. Also  I kind of like the medicinal fruity smell.
10376,oof,1,02-Dec-17,,Smells great and has a cooling effect to it!
10377,Gia,1,27-Feb-18,,Helped get rid of stubborn acne and dry spots! Love it.

10379,Lauren,1,10-Apr-15,,I live in an extremely humid and hot climate  and love this stuff as moisturizer for the spring and summer. I m about to finish my second jar and will definitely be repurchasing this to go with a nice sunscreen for my daytime routine. By the end of the day  I definitely feel like I need to wash my face  but it is nowhere near as oily as other moisturizers tend to make it.
10380,Kate,1,11-Nov-17,,Scent changed to something I like less but still works

After a week of using this product I truly noticed a difference to the feel of my skin. What a cool hidden find. By the way  I am a swimmer and I plan to recommend this product to my fellow swimmers. Excellent!
10384,katherine valli,0,27-Aug-14,2 people found this helpful,it goes on like a gel and dries leaving my face with a shiny finish. i don t know how to explain it  but it is not pleasant. i was looking for a light moisturizer to use since i have oily skin  but it makes it appear even shinier than it actually is. this was a waste of money and is going out in the trash. cetaphil moisturizer is a much better product. i ve been using it for a while and should have just stuck with it.
10385,Amazon Customer,1,30-Apr-17,,This gel/cream is fabulous. It feels cool when I apply it and after softly massaging it on my face  my skin feels really hydrated. I usually wear it under my makeup and my skin looks and feels amazing and it helps my makeup look more natural.

In the winter my skin gets very dry so I use the one for dry skin and it moisturizes my skin so well and in the summer I use the one for normal skin. It is my favorite moisturizer and by far the best I ve ever used.
10389,floody,1,05-Jan-16,,In the colder months my skin can get very dry. This year  no matter how much lotion I put on  my skin was still super dry. I would get dry  chapped patches on my face that would last for days. I tried this stuff and it WORKS. No more dry skin. I love it. It has a nice feel to it too.

10393,Amazing Purchases,1,25-Jan-17,,This is the only facial moisturizer that keeps my skin clear and hydrated.
10394,Lindsey K,1,18-Jun-15,,This is comparable to the Clinique Moisture Surge moisturizer but not quite as good. I love keeping this in my fridge though! It feels great on a hot day or right before bed.
10395,Jess,1,22-Feb-15,,Extremely moisturizing and cooling. Perfect for moisturizing winter skin or battling tropical weather. I live in year-round tropical weather and with the extreme humidity and dryness  this refreshes and cools off my skin. Feels great  and glides on smoothly.
10396,sarah navarro,1,31-Dec-15,,Super light weight and amazing! My skin is usually dry this time of year; being that I live in a desert and all! But since buying this moisturizer  I can say bye bye to dry  problem skin!

10398,IndyAnna,0,07-Jun-17,,I have used and likes most Garnier skin care products and was excited to try this  as I had previously tried the  blue  hyaluronic gel moisturizer but found it to be too pricey  so I was excited about this. One problem -- it smelled like petroleum. I could NOT get away from the odor -- it was overwhelming and offensive  and I do NOT have a sensitivity to smells. Used it 3 times hoping it would improve but did not  so in the trash it went. Disappointing because I so wanted to like it and have it perform like its competitor.
10399,KKCMDC,0,30-Mar-17,,Disappointed doesn t moisturize my face at all.
10400,A. Shriner,1,28-Jul-16,,I love this stuff. I feel like it is one of the best face moisturizers out there and I have tried a lot.
10401,Gianni,1,07-Mar-14,,I have a very oily skin in order to that I m very careful for what I use for my face. I have been using this for almost a Year and I can say that my Face never looks this amazing until now. Its very refreshing! making my face feel light  fresh and also smooth. I alsohave a clear skin ever since I started using this product. I would recommend this especially for those who have a very oily skin.
10402,JoyC.,1,07-Aug-16,,This product feels very comfortable on the skin. The only thing I would change is to make it unscented.

10404,shannon runke,0,04-Oct-14,,I generally don t leave feedback  but I felt I needed to speak my mind. After I gave this gel a chance (used it for a week)  I couldn t stand the smell anymore and tossed it in the trash. I don t know why there were so many people saying it smelled good. I must have received a bad batch. As far as the purpose of this gel  I didn t think it moisturized my very dry skin at all.

I would not recommend this to anyone. my skin is normal with a semi oily T-zone.

Of all of the moisturizing gels I have tried  this is by far the best (and the cheapest!). It glides on smooth  is fast absorbing  and leaves my skin refreshed and matte. It is winter now and I find this product to be moisturizing enough even in the cold and wind.

10429,Gatie,0,27-Dec-12,7 people found this helpful,I bought this moisturizer because it had a nice price and I like some of Garnier s other products. But this one is a big disappointment. It feels like rubbing alcohol for your face. I have to use a moisturizer for my face because it is so tight and dry after washing. But this stuff no matter how little or how much I use  goes on and dries leaving my face feeling tighter and uncomfortable. I am not fon dof the smell hence the rubbing alcohol reference as well. I think I will go back to the Loreal moisturizer I was using. The price for this is good but it is not worth it.
10430,boramkim,1,13-May-15,,Very nice. Fantastic seller. Everything is great!
10431,Nmit,0,20-Mar-12,4 people found this helpful,This looked like a great product. It has a light  airy texture and goes on like a dream  with a cooling  refreshing feeling on your skin. But it has way  way  too much perfume in it. The scent does not dissipate with time  so if you re sensitive to artificial fragrance  steer clear. Also  after a half hour of wearing the gel  that soothing sensation turns to a stinging irritation. I had to wash it off. Too bad  it would have been a great product if they had left out the harsh fragrance. Who wants artificial scent on their face anyway?
10432,LSKS2019,1,23-Sep-16,,This is super expensive and frankly I am surprised that I bought it. Having said that  my skin has definitely improved and not greasy or oily after application. Great product  definitely high priced  and I would recommend to anyone.

10436,JCW,1,21-Mar-11,25 people found this helpful,I am all about gel moisturizers because I find that the majority of non-gel creams out there give me a filmy/sweaty feeling on my nose and my upper lip area. I absolutely abhor this feeling! This gel cream is a great alternative to what I used to use: the Clinique Moisture Surge moisturizer. The Garnier Gel Cream absorbs quickly and definitely is enough moisture for me. I have combination skin and am usually only oily in the T-zone area. I love this stuff and it smells so great!
10437,Amazon Customer,0,07-Aug-14,,After finding out that you sent a  care package  to the women off the Israeli army so they could  pamper themselves  in times of war  I and my family will never buy your products again - you support genocide  the murder of innocent children and glorify war! No amount of your product could ever cleanse/refresh or make anyone ever look good again.

10450,Jeraldin,1,17-Mar-17,24 people found this helpful,Skin type: real real real dry  sensitive  acne-prone  It is so refreshing to find a moisturizer that moisturizers all day! Being someone who has eczema it s very hard to find a moisturizer that I don t have to reapply. My foundation no longer looks cakey which is so refreshing! Highly recommend for anyone who has my similar skin type.  The only reason I am giving in 4 starts is because it s way smaller then I expected. Paying $25 for just 60ml? Not sure why I didn t notice that but I guess since it s expected it ll only go on your face the size is fine. The good thing is a little goes a long way with this lotion so this being my first week with it I d say it ll probably last me maybe 2-3 months?  Bottom line: DEFINITELY moisturizes. If you have super duper dry and sensitive skin; this is the one for you. Not sure if I d rebuy just because of size but the product itself is great!
10451,fgalmiche,1,03-Jan-19,11 people found this helpful,I have extremely sensitive skin  and when I use a product that my skin rejects  my face immediately turns into a red inflamed histamine fireball and looks totally raw -- basically  I might as well have exfoliated with a brick. After trying a lot of different Korean moisturizing creams  this is one of the few so far that does NOT make my face sting at all. In fact  I basically don t feel much impact at all  which is exactly what I want. Although I am pushing 40 and probably could use a cream that delivers a bit more moisturizing punch  I really just don t like the feel of applying super gooey dewy moisturizers. This one just goes on  softens the face  and there is no sticky residue. I can gently poke or pat my face a few minutes later  and the face feels  kinda soft  and that s about it. I like this! Of course  if it s a night where I put a sleeping pack over it  then things get gooey. The only other product from Klairs that I have tried is this serum called  Freshly Juiced Vitamin C Serum   which I actually put on RIGHT BEFORE I put this cream on. The two pair together really nicely? In fact  for the past few weeks  I have been mixing the cream with 3 drops of the serum. (I highly recommend that serum for anyone who has large pores -- it is the one and only product that has ever worked in visibly reducing pores on my face. Total game/life-changer!!) Although I am no skin care expert  my positive review of this moisturizer is based on having tried and erred with many K-beauty brands and accepting that most of the products from brands like Missha  TonyMoly  Skinfood  Etude House  and even Neogen irritate my skin badly. I am looking forward to trying more from Klairs! Any recommendations would be extremely welcome  as I have only tried the two things so far (this cream and the serum I mentioned).
10452,CChau,0,16-Jan-18,14 people found this helpful,I ve been using it for a month now and it definitely didn t work for me  my face gets pretty oily and I do tend to get really large pores but also get lots of dry patches on my cheeks and temples . This cream made my pores so clogged and large around my cheeks and did nothing for my dry patched. Im currently using it for my neck and hands but I m still disappointed on the results of my face :(
10453,Maglio,1,30-Jun-17,12 people found this helpful,This is the hands down best moisturizer I ve ever used. I have super sensitive skin that easily breaks out but is dehydrated. Often moisturizers targeted for my skin type are too thin where my skin feels dry still or way too thick where it can t breathe. It also doesn t really have a scent at all and is smooth. I do use other moisturizing serums with it but it hits all my check boxes
10454,Camorri,1,30-Oct-17,11 people found this helpful,I ve tried a lot of face products lately and this moisturizer is a life saver! Im 30 and have oily skin with both fine lines and acne. This moisturizer feels amazing and really soothing. Some times if my retinol treatment stings or burns a bit applying this will sooth my skin fast  and the sting will stop and my skin will be comfortable again.  Really impressed!
10455,Abern,1,17-Aug-18,7 people found this helpful,I use this as my night moisturizer because it doesn t have SPF in it. First  I cleanse my face by using a cotton ball with Witch Hazel. Then I  second cleanse  by gently washing my face with a pH balances cleanser. After cleansing  I use the Witch Hazel again  as a toner  by pressing it in my face with my hands. When the toner is mostly dry  not fully  I put the Klair Rich Moist Soothing cream on my face. Its so moisturizing thats only a pea amount does the job. Plus it has so many nutrients that my skin loves. When I wake up in the morning  my face looks glowy and refreshed. Hands down one of the best moisturizers i ve tried.
10456,AW,1,28-Feb-18,10 people found this helpful,This moisturizer works great during the warmer months but it s definitely not moisturizing enough for my super dry/sensitive skin during the colder months.

10458,Kevin L.,1,31-Jan-18,5 people found this helpful,creamy but light consistency that moisturizes well. I would say the moisture is comparable to The Ordinary s Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA. I am Acne-prone but this does not clog my pores or break me out! Great for fall/winter. During the day  I use it as my last step before sunscreen and at night it is my last step.
10459,Kyla M.,1,28-Jul-18,3 people found this helpful,I have only had this stuff for about a week  and all I can say is omg!!! This is by FAR the best moisturizer I have ever used. My skin is not super sensitive  but I am very prone to acne. I didn t think this would make very much of a difference with my skin but so far I have nothing but good things to say about it. I work 12-15 hours shifts and when I get home from work every day my skin looks exactly like it did that morning--moisturized but not oily like it usual is. I usually have to wear makeup but I haven t had to the past couple of days because my skin has been looking so great (I have also been using the Klairs freshly juiced vitamin drop). All I can say is I am super excited that I found this product and I will definitely continue to use it!!!
10460,Mae,1,19-Jun-17,6 people found this helpful,Perfect for dry  sensitive and acne-prone skin  especially during winter. It does not make your face look oily at all  and absorbs well. This moisturizer clearly controlled my acne; no breakout at all.
10461,Sarah H,1,06-Nov-17,3 people found this helpful,I have very dry sensitive skin due to Retin A and acne issues. This is literally one of the best moisturizers I ve ever used. Clean  vegan formula  free of unnecessary fragrance  dyes and chemicals. I feel it s comparable to the first aid beauty ultra repair cream. This mixed with two drops of The Ordinary s plant squalane will have your skin feeling baby soft and completely hydrated.

10463,LR1114,1,16-Jun-19,One person found this helpful,I ve been waiting for my bottle to be nearly done to write a review. I decided to try it even if it had some reviews of rashes and breakouts. My skin is not acne prone so I do have some flexibility trying out new stuff. That being said I am surprised at the way it feels and how hydrating it is. I got is a recommendation from a friend and even though with moisturizers I like trying out new stuff  this one is a keeper. Before minding reviews  read about the ingredients  consider them in relation to your skin and decide from then on. Not all skin types react the sams way.

I don t know why the price increased so much  but I would still recommend it!
10468,Ron G.,0,19-Apr-19,,I tried this product for 3 months and it clogged my pores... even with a strict cleaning ritual. I have combination skin and my T zone wasn t getting enough moisture from this and left my cheeks and chin super greasy. I was t super fond of the scent and I don t really feel it was light weight. I have since switched to Nuetrogena moisturizer and toner which leaves my pores unclogged and my skin evenly moisturized without leaving parts of my face greasy and others still feeling dry. Seriously  if you struggle with dry skin  try applying toner before moisturizer because it preps your skin to absorb a moisturizer. I don t even have to use an intense moisturizer like Klair s anymore which makes me happy because it means no clogged pores.
10469,Adele,1,03-Jul-17,3 people found this helpful,Surprisingly good and light for my super sensitive skin. I tend to get allergic reactions to new skincare products and was taking a risk with this  as there was no where to get a sample. I was pleasantly surprised at how well my skin took to it. Will recommend to anyone.
10470,Amazon Customer,1,04-May-16,3 people found this helpful,I was using other products  and I irritated my skin   I decided to buy klairs because I have very sensitive skin and can really notice the change at the time . Indeed  these products are very good   my skin looks more radiant   more moisturized   more natural and even much healthier . Really I recommend them ..
10471,Amazon Customer,1,26-Jan-18,2 people found this helpful,I love this moisturizer! It doesn t make my acne any worse and it keeps my skin from getting super dry (which is what normally leads to my skin getting oily). I m only giving it four stars because although it feels (and works) great  there is a very fine line between the perfect amount to use and having a tiny bit too much  which makes my face look shiny. A little goes a long way!
10472,Product reviews,1,21-Feb-18,2 people found this helpful,?I use this during my day routine and i love it. It blends well with the klairs sunscreen and its not thick  It smells really good too.
10473,Kelli,1,04-May-18,One person found this helpful,Best face cream I have ever tried. I have oily combination skin. This doesn t break me out and has a very light citrus scent. The smell doesn t bother me and I have noticed less redness in my skin. I hope Klairs never stops making this because it is my holy grail!
10474,Ashley R.,1,12-Nov-18,One person found this helpful,Works for my skin. A little on the dry side for winter use. Summer weather  this was nice and moisturizing. Will be repurchasing this summer :)
10475,Nina Nina,1,06-Dec-18,One person found this helpful,This product is perfect. The price is worth it. My skin is so hydrated that when I get my Botox treatments the nurse always comments how easy needles go in.
10476,CA Davis,1,23-Mar-19,,I like the fairly neutral scent and the texture of the product  but it s a little too greasy for my oily skin. It would be great for someone on the drier side than me. (For reference I m in my mid 30s with sensitive  oily skin. If you re like me  try Mizon s Snail Recovery Gel. It s hydrating without feeling too heavy.)
10477,lem,1,27-May-18,One person found this helpful,I have a very dry skin. I tried several moisturizer and a friend told me about this Klairs moisturizer and the toner. So far  it s been good and my skin has not been showing any flakes. It s not sticky and no smell which is good. I ll update this post if ever there had been any changes soon. :)
10478,Amazon Customer,1,03-Jan-17,3 people found this helpful,Ultra rich and creamy lotion  but not greasy or heavy. I have super dry skin and this product works for me.
10479,brenda :),1,12-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,such a simple cream you cant go wrong it has an amazing natural herbal scent (not fragrant) fragrance breaks me out this doesnt i find it soothing on my skin love it!
10480,Mike Rivera,0,24-Mar-19,,This moisturizer would be perfect if not for the essentials oils. This moisturizer has an amazing formulation. It makes your skin look perfect  and has very nourishing ingredients. Unfortunately this is all undercut by is the essential oils it contains for fragrance. These ingredients are the most irratating ones in skincare and serve no benefit for the skin. They will make your face flush and really irritate it. Even if you have no reaction at first you can get one at anytime. Really wish they would come out with a new fragrance free formulation.
10481,Cat,1,05-Aug-17,4 people found this helpful,I m 28 with combination skin  dry cheeks and chin with a super oily T-zone. I have the occasional hormonal acne on my jawline/chin  but otherwise I m acne free. Finding a moisturizer that gives me the hydration I need without making my face look like a slip-n-slide has been a challenge. I ve found the holy grail in this product! I adore this moisturizer! I ve been using twice a day for about a month as part of my 7 step skincare routine and  other than the price being a bit steep ($19.95 when I bought it) it s perfect! A little goes a long way  it s super creamy to the touch  very spreadable  and it leaves my face feeling hydrated but not greasy. I still have to blot half way through the day  but I live in a super hot and humid area (plus my oily t-zone) so that s normal. I m a little disappointed at how little product you get for the price. I really love this moisturizer though so I might stick with it and eat the price if I can t find anything comparable.  Edit: Now that this product s price has been reduced to around $15 I am stocking up!! Still my favorite moisturizer!
10482,ErinNicole,1,25-Jun-19,,This stuff is so soothing  I use it after cleansing and applying a hydrating toner. It feels like it really seals in the hydration and soothes at the same time. I have mild rosacea and the soothing feeling is awesome!
10483,cynthia holdsworth,1,29-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,This is a great moisturizer. I have been for about a month or so and my skin looks fantastic. I have a glow I haven’t had in years.
10484,Hassan,1,11-May-19,,This moisturizer is so nice! It is lightweight and non greasy. It goes on smoothly and works well over other serums and under makeup. It smells nice too! I have spent so much on expensive moisturizers and it s nice to find this at only $18! It s a small tube but a little goes a very long way. Try it!
10485,Silivrenwolf,1,25-May-18,One person found this helpful,I bought this product several months ago and loved it! So glad that Amazon is selling it. Great moisturizer that doesn t feel oily on my skin.
10486,Stephanie,1,14-May-19,,It’s a no-frills  awesome face cream. I have combo/oily skin  and I use this at night. (It would be too much for me in the day in summer  but that is because I’m quite oily in my t-zone. In winter I could see using this during the day as well.) I love that it doesn’t have a scent and absorbs fairly quickly. It does exactly what I want it to do?moisturize well without clogging my pores or irritating my skin! I have been really happy with everything I’ve tried so far from Klairs.
10487,Lauren Campbell,1,17-May-18,One person found this helpful,Love this stuff. Keep trying to find something that soothes and is cheaper. No luck yet. HG
10488,Bizzybee,1,14-Jun-19,,I always come back to this product because the name says it all. It’s rich moist and very soothing for my hyper sensitive rosacea prone skin. Can’t live without it.

10490,OllieWog,1,09-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,Ultra moisturizing  I use it twice a day in the Winter. I use it only at night during the Summer because it can make skin a bit oily. I’m on my third bottle.

10492,Amazon Customer,1,14-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,I like that it has no fragrance. I put it on at night as a last step in my skin care routine and the next morning my face is very soft and moisturized. I really like the klairs line I would definitely buy again.
10493,Nicanor B. Munji Jr.,1,19-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,This is my favorite moisturizer. I was looking for a cruelty free product and this works pretty well and isn t super pricey. I have dry / combo skin but this works really well. It s not greasy or too thick.
10494,Build It Direct,1,07-May-18,One person found this helpful,Love this product. Keeps my face moisturized the whole day and doesn t have any funky smell. 2nd time purchased.
10495,Amazon Customer,1,30-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,Great product. Super moisturizing and ok for acne prone skin.
10496,Michael Fiorito,1,15-Apr-19,,I really enjoy this moisturizer for day and night use. I used to use the Midnight Blue Calming Cream from them but it’s expensive for the amount you get to use twice a day. This is a really good alternative. Can be a little oily after I first put it on but it eventually seeps into the skin. Also helps with any redness or irritation I may have.
10497,Amazon Customer,1,02-Jun-19,,my face feels soft and moisturize ...it does not give any breakouts....definetely buying it again...
10498,SD,1,30-Dec-15,2 people found this helpful,I love this cream. My skin is sensitive and many creams irritate my skin. But this cream smooths and moistens my skin without leaving it oily! Will recommend this one. And little goes a long way!

10500,Nitz Fitz,0,10-Mar-19,,Not much to get excited about. Never again I will buy Klairs products.
10501,Hayden,1,27-May-19,,I freaking love this stuff. I can layer it in my skin care routine or mix it with my foundation for lighter coverage and a more natural look. I love the way it smells and you don’t need much  a little goes a long way.
10502,Helen,1,27-Feb-19,,The tube is convienient to carry around. I am always traveling so this is beneficial to me. Most creams don’t come in a squeeze tube so I am very happy with this product. I have combination skin and this product really helped a girl out.
10503,Jenny,1,24-May-18,,I probably trust this product the most while mixed in with another brand. I can say that I go through it like crazy. It is super moisturizing. It is a cream moisturizer.
10504,Kasa,1,12-Jan-19,,This is a really really good every day moisturizer! Doesn’t break me out either!!
10505,Amazon Customer,1,19-Feb-18,,This moisturizer is amazing! It s thick without being greasy  and it definitely hydrates your face well. I have very sensitive skin  and this has not irritated my skin at all. I ve found my go-to moisturizer.
10506,Jessica,1,25-Jan-18,,This is probably one of the best moisturizers I ve ever used. I have dry sensative skin with hormonal acne. it didn t irritate me at all

10513,Dee,1,12-Jan-18,,My new favorite moisturizer. I wasn t too impressed in the beginning but then I noticed the redness on my face would be worse when I skip using this for a day. Now I can t go without it! Amazon needs to restock!!
10514,Elizabeth,1,14-Jun-19,,I love this moisturizer. I use this whenever my skin is super dry due to irritation and it makes my skin soft. It also has a nice scent and makes my skin soft and velvety.
10515,Amazon Customer,1,30-May-19,,Beautiful product. It is great with makeup. Glides on  moisturizing and has dewy effect without feeling greasy/oily or heavy. Love this much!

10519,Anna Wheeler,1,18-Dec-17,,Didn t break out or upset my sensitive skin  but wasn t quite as moisturizing as I would like. Better for daytime use but would choose something heavier for nighttime or winter.

10521,Chaia Xiong,1,06-Jan-18,,I like it but not as much product as I thought.
10522,Amazon Customer,1,16-May-17,,I have really dry and sensitive skin and the product is really great for both concerns. The only downside is it s quite expensive for the amount you get.
10523,M.B.,1,02-Jan-18,,Really thick and rich moisturizer. Very helpful during the winter. Have had no issues with break outs.

10533,Amazon Customer,0,12-Apr-17,2 people found this helpful,tl;dr It broke me out really bad  but It arrived in good condition.  I don t normally have pimples  but I have sensitive skin that breaks out when a product doesn t work well. I have combination skin and some dry patches on my face  so I was looking for a good moisturizing product that would leave my skin hydrated all day (which it did). I had used it for three days straight and my face broke out REALLY BAD on my cheeks. I d never broken out this much before.  This was just my personal experience. I ve actually head really good things about this moisturizer from people saying it was good for sensitive  acne prone skin.  If you re worried about the packaging; it was really nice when it arrived. So I wouldn t be worried about that.

I have combo skin and I sweat during my workday so I ve been looking for a lightweight moisturizer that doesn t make me oily but still keeps me well hydrated all day. This is it.

10540,Customer,0,23-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,This gave me a rash. I would no repurchase. It has a bunch of essential oils that can irritate anybody. No matter what skintype you are. I threw it away. Although it says it’s free of fragrance don’t be fooled. It has a list of essential oils which bassically is what makes up fragrance in the first place. If I were you I would just not buy this at all
10541,Yeri T.,1,15-Oct-15,2 people found this helpful,Heard a lot of good things about this soothing cream~I put in the fridge for about 45 minutes to give a even cooling effect & i have to say it really boost up the soothing of this cream.. Overall it s a really nice & soothing cream for a everyday or every night moisturizer!!
10542,Emma,1,30-Jan-17,,This is a nice moisturizer  however I found it a little thick and not very easy to spread  it absorbs very quickly though and has little to no scent. The bottle is too small in my opinion but that s okay because once I ran out I didn t plan on using it anymore anyways. While it s a good moisturizer there are just options that work better with my skin type and preferences available.
10543,Amazon Customer,1,26-Oct-15,,I love this moisturizer  it works amazing and I love how it leaves my skin so soft!...??
10544,Elle,1,10-Sep-16,One person found this helpful,I highly recommend this to anyone with dry or sensitive skin! It has never irritated my skin (unlike many moisturizers). My only wish is that the jar was bigger because I go through it pretty quickly (but I consider it worth it).
10545,Kayla S.,1,24-May-17,,Absolutely love this product!! I had a hard time finding a cruelty-free and vegan friendly lotion that would work well under my makeup and not leave my skin too oily  but this cream is the VIP in that department! You have to wait a bit for it to sink in to the skin and absorb  but its well worth it. I d say my only problem was that it didn t come as full with product as I had initially thought. But other than that  just an amazing lotion!! Will be buying again!!
10546,Tiffany,0,18-Jun-18,One person found this helpful,After reading so many good reviews about this product  I was very disappointed that my skin severely dried out and broke out into little red bumps after using this. I have sensitive-dry combination skin with eczema and this moisturizer completely dried out my cheeks. I will definitely not be using this again.

10550,Tyra Isaacs,1,26-Jan-18,2 people found this helpful,Not gonna lie  I didn’t like this product at first. I have very dry skin and was looking for a low maintenance moisturizer. This does the job but it drys a bit  matte  and doesn’t give that super intense hydration feeling. BUT after using it for about a month  I’ve come to appreciate the matte feeling. My skin is definitely still moisturized but since I use it in the morning  it’s quick drying nature makes it perfect enough to use under makeup. Not enough hydration for night time but it’s an excellent morning and gym face moisturizer. Love it!!
10551,JenEvan,1,21-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,Originally this is supposed to replace my Cerave PM  however earlier this week my skin was overexfoliated & was irritated even by Cerave PM (definitely a sign of compromised skin barrier = when a gentle/usually agreeable product angers your skin). So I thought of testing the  soothing  property of this moisturizer and I’m very happy that it is! It’s a slightly oilier moisturizer than Cerave PM  so I only apply this lightly on my oily/clog prone skin. But my angry skin is a lot calmer even at the worst spots after applying this product & I can even continue layering this with Cerave PM with no more reaction!
10552,Alex,1,11-Mar-17,2 people found this helpful,Best moisturizer I ve ever used  hands down. It has a subtle cooling sensation and is great for sensitive skin. I have very acne prone skin and this product is a godsend. I can t live without it.
10553,d89ielle,1,12-Apr-17,,Combination/Dry skin: I have been searching for facial moisturizers that don t dry my skin out post-wash. I m happy with the result after using the proper face wash. I recently purchased the Klog Box and this was a sample item I used every day until I ran out and every time I used it  my skin felt so soft and not tight like it was when I used Clean&Clear. No more drug store face lotions!
10554,Jennifer Park,0,29-Jan-18,,Really disappointed with the lack of actual product that comes in the tube. The bottle was almost near empty when I opened and tried it for the first time. You have to squeeze the sides of the tube super closely before any product comes out  and for this price  such little product isn t worth it. Not sure if that s the standard or mine was a mistake  but so disappointing.
10555,Amazon Customer,1,19-Jan-18,,This moisturizer is great for acne-prone skin that s dry and sensitive. Overall  it s a great basic moisturizer.  Pros: - Absorbs Quickly - Moisturizing - Fragrance Free  Cons: - Small

10558,RayLaur,1,04-Dec-17,9 people found this helpful,This is my holy grail of moisturizer. I have sensitive combination skin  that gets dry in the winter  but can look greasy with some moisturizers. This is great for layering with treatments and I wake up with glowing skin. I use Klairs toner  Klairs vitamin c  then this with a layer of vitamin packed gel on top every night. It works great through all seasons. I recommend for anyone with sensitive skin  especially if you have red spots. This will help soothe without becoming greasy.
10559,Katie,1,28-Jun-16,20 people found this helpful,This stuff is amazing  and now I m interested in trying out other products by KLARIS!  For a quick background  I m 20 years old and have been suffering from sensitive/dry/acne prone skin since I was a freshman in high school. I have A really pale complexion and my face gets red and irritated very easily if I use a product that is too harsh. BUT THIS KLARIS MOISTURIZER IS THE BEST THING THAT I VE EVER TRIED! I used to use a sunscreen/moisturizer that my dermatologist prescribed me. It was working for a while during the fall  but then winter came along and I started to notice that the product she prescribed to me wasn t getting rid or smoothing the dry/flaky patches around my nose and mouth. But I still kept using it because I thought  the doctor knows best.  When I went to see her again in early spring  I told her about the problem  and she just prescribed the same product but with less sunscreen and more moisturizer...So I followed her directions  but then noticed that the stuff was starting to burn my skin...IT SERIOUSLY FELT LIKE HELL HAD DROPPED A FIRE BOMB ON MY FACE! And it not only didn t get rid of the dry patches but also made my face very irritable and itchy. So I took matters into my own hands and did some research.  I ve always been a fan of Korean beauty products  and so I looked into specific brands and products that were orientated around dry/sensitive skin. KLARIS is a brand that is known for creating great products for people with sensitive and dry skin  so I decided to give this KLARIS Rich Moist Soothing Cream a go. AND I REPEAT  THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. It hydrates and smooths my skin  getting rid of any dry areas and does not irritate at all! It also feels very light on the skin  which is a plus for me at least  as I don t like putting a lot of stuff on my face  including skin products and makeup.  Overall  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has problems with dry/sensitive skin. It doesn t make me break out either! Highly  highly  highly recommend and I can t wait to try out more products from KLARIS!
10560,Susane,1,06-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,For someone in Colorado  which has an extremely dry climate  this is a great addition to my skincare routine. Usually by the end of the day I ll feel a little flaky on my face but this cream really provides hydrating relief. And although the product is small  I only use a dab and it covers my face fully. Best parts for me are that it is mostly scentless  goes on very smoothly  doesn t feel oily or heavy and actually gives your skin a little soft and smooth texture after
10561,Diane Lee,0,13-Sep-18,2 people found this helpful,This is my fourth time ordering this product. I normally love this face lotion and it’s become my go to daily moisturizer. But this last shipment smells really strange. Almost like a chemically plastic smell. This is either a bad batch or not the same product I’ve gotten in the past.
10562,Ally,1,26-Oct-18,,I ve been using this product for several months now and this is the first time I ve had to reorder it. My skin is combination and sensitive/acne prone for reference. I was looking for a good moisturizer that would help with dry spots as well.  Pros: -Very hydrating! -You don t look  greasy  for more than 15-20 minutes in my experience -Didn t break me out -Didn t irritate my sensitive skin -Cruelty free!  Cons: -A little bit pricey but a little bit goes a long way - I use a quarter size at night or as needed. -A vague smell of ginger (it goes away eventually)  Overall  this moisturizer is worth purchasing.
10563,Chel,1,26-Jan-19,One person found this helpful,I d highly recommend this moisturizer. I tend to have fairly dry skin and this stuff does an excellent job of making my usually parched skin feel well hydrated. As far as scents go  this product is not at all unpleasant or overpowering  smelling about like any unscented lotion might. The only downside I can personally see would probably be the pretty hefty price given its size  but you really don t need to use very much at one time. Without overdoing it a tube could last for a pretty decent length of time.
10564,s abraham,1,05-Apr-19,,I really like this cream  it feels lovely on your face and I even use it on my eyes. It has a light smell which is pleasent. I love that its cruelty free. I used to order direct from korea which was a pita but seeing the same product here on amazon is wonderful.  one star deducted for packaging. that tube is terrible. within a short time you are having problems getting the product out with the result of bruised fingers and wasted product when it squirts out in error once you get it going. i now just slice open the tube and transfer it to a wide mouth jar.
10565,Jeni B.,1,31-Mar-19,One person found this helpful,I have sensitive skin and struggle with hormonal acne. I ve been using this product since December and really like it. It feels pretty thick but doesn t leave my face greasy or increase breakouts. It absorbs nicely and does a good job moisturizing my skin. It doesn t have much of a scent which I like.  This is a really nice face lotion for the price point and I ve already re-ordered it. I d say one tube lasted me about 2 months.
10566,Amazon Customer,1,14-Jul-18,,I’m on my second tube of this moisturizer and I absolutely love it! But know this  I only use it at night as my skin is combination/oily and I think this cream is a bit too heavy for oily skin types like me to wear during the day (though it does absorb nicely). However  it is the perfect nighttime moisturizer  hydrating my skin and soothing it at the same time. It really does have a mild cooling effect and it never irritates my skin  even if I use it on broken skin due to popped pimples  etc. The smell is light and clean and I like it a lot. Overall  I’d definitely recommend this moisturizer for dry and normal skin types the most  though I believe that all skin types would benefit from this cream. Also  the tube looks small  but because I only use it at night  it lasts me several months (around 6 months or more actually).
10567,Sarah Vo,1,17-Dec-18,,I love this moisturizer and this is my second bottle of it. I have oily combo skin with dryness outside of my T-zone  so it hydrates the dray areas so well. I don t put a lot in the T-zone area but a little goes a long way. I use it as a night cream and wake up with super soft skin. It s really good for sensitive skin since both me and my sister have sensitive skin and we re prone to breaking out. I don t use this during the day though since it can be heavy  but I always do at night to replenish my skin for the day after.
10568,Christine L.,1,08-Sep-17,2 people found this helpful,My skin loves this cream. I have combination skin and I use this morning and night. It feels like it sinks into my skin and my face stays hydrated. It has a very light pleasant scent. I really wish they would put this in a jar because I hate to waste good product because of the packaging.
10569,W. Felten,1,16-Apr-19,,I love this cream so much! I have extremely sensitive skin and have frequent dermatitis flare ups. This stuff is calming and moisturizes my skin so we ll. I wish they made it in a larger quantity. It s hard to find something that s not overly greasy as well as Non- pore clogging. It doesn t really have a scent which is even better! No harsh perfumes that can cause more redness. I ve been searching high and low and found this product by accident! It s actually calming to my skin and have had to use less cortisone skin cream which is a big plus! Korean skin care knows their stuff! Great product! Love love love Klairs!
10570,seung lee,1,21-Nov-15,6 people found this helpful,Great moisturizing cream but just great for moisture and oil balance.  I have super dry skin so this helps soothe my troubles.  Not really for wrinkle care or pigment correction.  It s not sticky and soaks in skin really well. Love it!
10571,Amanda,1,17-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,I use two moisturizers. I use this one first because it s very fast absorbing and moisturizing  but doesn t seem to leave any kind of moisture barrier on top of my skin. If you don t have extremely dry skin like me  I m positive this moisturizer will work on it s own for you. When I use this  at the end of the day my face still feels super soft.
10572,lovetia06,1,06-Aug-18,,It s soothing and moisturizing but I feels average. Not the greatest but it works. I have oily sensitive skin and my skin had no issues with it. It absorbs right into my skin. Light weight. Good for beginner getting into moisturizer. I think it works well with all skin type. It has no smell and texture is a thick cream. Only downside is that it s too small and for the price. If you use a lot  you ll run out fast.
10573,Alexis,1,04-Mar-17,3 people found this helpful,I have dry/dehydrated skin and this soaks right in. It s helped restore my moisture barrier. No breakouts (I am acne prone and extremely sensitive skinned). It s smoothed my skin out. I will be repurchasing this and am so glad I found it.
10574,Amazon Customer,1,26-Dec-17,One person found this helpful,A really nice gentle moisturizer! It is rich and thick  it s very similar to First Aid Beauty s ultra repair cream in smell  texture  and moisture power (in my opinion)  but this doesn t leave a film on my face like that one does.  I wish it was more deeply moisturizing  but it s nice for a year round moisturizer and is very comfortable under makeup. It s so gentle and natural that it s suitable for anyone of any age looking for a basic facial cream.
10575,Redsilas,0,11-Mar-18,,I bought this based off of numerous reviews on various Asian Beauty websites and Reddit threads and I have never been more disappointed in a moisturizer. I really broke out - meaning my face got red  hot  and irritated. Something in this caused a massive hot flare up on my face.  I thought it might have been something else in my routine so I tried it again over the course of two weeks and still had the same issues.
10576,E.,1,25-Apr-18,,After giving the Korean million-step skincare routine a try  I pared down to a few products that really worked. This moisturizer is amazing for my super dry skin. If I apply at night  I wake up with moisturized skin! And it mixes really well with a dab of foundation for a super light  moisturized B.B. cream effect. My only complaint is that it’s $24  but it’s worth it.
10577,C. BIRD,1,24-Apr-19,,I love how soothing this moisturizer is for my skin. I have rosacea and this does a great job at calming that down. It is a thick consistency  but doesn t feel heavy at all and doesn t feel greasy. I don t notice any kind of fragrance at all.
10578,a cacello,1,28-Jul-17,,I have oily/combo skin with the occasional bout of hormonal acne. This stuff is a godsend! It is pretty heavy  but even when I use it in my oily t-zone I don t go greasy. I have been experimenting with using only emulsions during the summer  but I will never not have a tube of this with me. Love this cream and this brand!
10579,Joe Schreiber,0,12-Feb-18,,I purchased this product after reading many positive reviews  and was at first very satisfied with this product  it did everything it claimed  soothed and provided lasting moisture  that is  until a few weeks later. After not even a month of using this product  I began to wake up horrible skin irritation  and an itchy face. It was awful. I immediately stopped using the product and my problem was solved within a day. I don t even have super sensitive skin.
10580,3xN,1,21-May-19,,This cream has done wonders for my face. You just need to dab a little of it on a few areas on your face and spread about. I like to pat it in. It s also cruelty free and vegan friendly. Super plus!
10581,Amy R.,1,14-Apr-18,,Great nighttime moisturizer. It is too thick for my sensitive skin during the day  but is nice and calming at night. A little goes a long way. Love that it is non-greasy and unscented. Not sure if it makes a huge difference in my redness  but I haven t had any flare-ups while using it.
10582,A. Engel-Beckett,1,08-Aug-18,,I have super sensitive skin and I m allergic to everything. This product is the only one of its kind that hasn t given me a rash. Really wish more of this brand was available on Amazon.
10583,Sangwoo,1,20-Jan-18,3 people found this helpful,I had been stalking this product FOREVER but held off cause I thought I should just finish off the moisturizer I was using. But I finally freaked out and bought it after my skin was screaming post trip to CA. I broke out all over  my skin was super dry and flaky despite the products I use  and it didn t help that where I live it was in the 20s. I decided I needed to go to something extra gentle and moisturizing. So glad I got this! It calmed my skin down ASAP  and gave my skin the moisture it needed without greasiness or clogging my pores. I bought the supple preparation toner as well and the combo is fantastic. I love the herbal smell of them both  very light  simple  and the texture of these products is just glorious. I definitely recommend this and I ll be buying this again!
10584,tacones,1,31-Mar-19,,Great reach moisurizer. I put it as part of my seven k steps  before i go to sleep. Good proce for quality. Doesnt smell.
10585,shannon :),1,05-Mar-18,,This is the best moisturizer that i ve ever used. I have combination skin with dry patches. The only complaint I have is with the amount of product you get.. I wish the tube was bigger.
10586,Rainbow94,1,12-Jan-19,,My new face moisturizer! Great for sensitive skin like mine. My face feels so hydrated but not heavy.
10587,SF,1,10-May-18,,I LOVE THIS CREAM. KEEPS MY FACE MOISTURIZED WITHOUT FEELING GREASY OR OILY. I HAVE TOLD EVERYONE ABOUT THIS. BOUGHT FOR MY MOM. WILL KEEP BUYING.
10588,Antonio G.,1,07-Jan-18,,Good winter cream! I buy this stuff for myself and daughters regularly especially in the dry winter months. We use in combo with Klairs soothing serum and vitamin c juice drop. Great brand with awesome products for sensitive prone skin.
10589,Faith,1,01-Feb-19,One person found this helpful,It has made my skin feel the most nourished that it has ever been in the winter. The only downside is that I ve been using it twice a day and I wish there was more product!
10590,Caroline Roberts,1,18-Mar-18,One person found this helpful,Amazing moisture  doesn’t irritate sensitive skin
10591,Phanha Proche,1,27-Apr-18,,It took about a few days to arrive at my house. For this time i ordered  the product comes as new. This is a morturizer that goes well under the bb cream or foundation. This is my second bottle. Thanks.
10592,Danie T,1,10-Apr-18,,What can I say? First of all it is hydrating for my very dry skin. I mix it with my vitamin c serum and magic.
10593,Ashley,1,12-Jan-18,,a really wonderful moisturizer if you have dehydrated skin. I’ve used it for day and night time and it also helped my acne inflammation. Will be repurchasing.
10594,Amanda H. Murray,1,03-Nov-17,,So hydrating it’s wAter based and wonderful. My fianc? even likes it. It’s mild  hardly any fragrance.
10595,marisolcorza,1,26-May-18,,I bought the cleansing foam and this cream and is fantastic my son had to many pimples and marks over his face this 2 products help a lot
10596,Adlez,1,09-May-17,,The cream is thicker than I expected but feels very smooth when applied to the skin. Been using it after washing my face at night and my skin has been feeling less irritated and smoother.
10597,Fannie,1,19-Sep-17,,Great  simple moisturizer. I love this brand.
10598,D. Kwon,1,18-Jan-18,One person found this helpful,Love this! Wish it came in a bigger size :(
10599,Vi,1,25-Dec-17,2 people found this helpful,Pros: Nice light fragrance  and it does feel like a rich hydrating moisturizer. I feel like it does have soothing properties  as when I tried using vitamin C serum my face was exploding in blotches and pimples even when diluted with another moisturizer; when I mixed it with the Klairs soothing cream it definitely minimized the reaction (though was not enough to prevent it completely). I also found that unlike a lot of other heavier creams  this one didn t feel like it was trapping heat against my skin (if that makes sense) as my skin tends to get irritated and red when it gets overly heated or occluded.  Cons: I feel like it is a little rich so I personally did not like using it for daytime wear under my makeup. I ve only been using it during nighttime for the past 1.5 months and I m already almost out (and I only apply to my face and a little bit of my neck)  so not expensive but I wouldn t call it an excellent value.
10600,Sam,1,07-Jun-16,,I only use this on the spots I have pimple and after a a few hours  sometimes a day  it gets rid of the pimple. Its a good product :) But it smells like volcanic ash lol
10601,Amazon Customer,1,15-Feb-18,,Very soothing after irritation from vitamin c reaction. Skin is softer and more call. After a single day.
10602,EmIngy,1,18-Jan-18,2 people found this helpful,This is a great product. I have been using this moisturizer for the last month as a part of a Korean 10-step routine. It has a light  almost imperceptible fragrance. It works well on sensitive skin  and I’ve even been using it on my kids’ faces since the weather has been so cold; my 9 year old son even likes it. I doubt I will use it in the summer months  but this is a great moisturizer that I will definitely continue to use. That being said  this moisturizer isn’t really corrective  it seems to act best as a moisture barrier; i.e. this product is at its best as a lock-it-in moisturizer for skin that seems to lose moisture. I have found that I need to use other products to address my issues with fine lines or dark spots. But overall  a great product to have.
10603,Dokyunnie,1,17-Dec-16,,One of the best creams I ve ever tried so far. Really like this cream  just kinda sad how it s pricey and only contains 60 mL.
10604,Gigi,1,22-Sep-18,,My fave so far  I m gonna buy again; especially for this winter because my skin gets really dry and this is perfect for the cold season
10605,anonymous,0,10-Aug-17,,I was super excited to use this product but it dried out my skin rather than moisturizing it.
10606,Helen,1,10-Mar-17,3 people found this helpful,This product is great. I ve had it for 4 months and barely making my second purchase. I only use it as my night cream. It hydrates and softens your skin overnight. However  too thick and makes my face oily if used in the daytime. I wish I could also it use it in the day! I have combination skin - Oily T-zones  prone to breakout easily and dry hear and there. I love it enough to purchase again... hopefully it will not fail me one day.
10607,anefb,1,24-Jul-17,,I love this facial moisturizer and cannot imagine not using it daily on my face. Ive used many moisturizers and they always seem to make my skin itchy or oily in some areas. This moisturizer does neither  it is a great base for applying makeup as well. This product applies smoothly  has a very sloght scent that i like  and it is easily absorbed into my skin leaving no oily residue. I will be ordering another one for my sister.
10608,Y.N.,1,15-Aug-17,,As with any skin care product  YMMV. HOWEVER for me this product works amazing. It s the first skincare product I ve used that lives up to its name; it s definitely rich and moist and soothing for my skin. I use it morning and night under sunscreen and makeup and it s working great even in 90 degree weather in NY. My makeup stays looking pretty decent and my skin stays hydrated.
10609,uspork,0,04-Nov-17,2 people found this helpful,Not for oily  dehydrated  sensitive  and acne-prone skin. Not sure if it s the oil or algin in the formulation that causes breakouts. Definitely not for oily and acne-prone skin. Stick to an oil-free product!
10610,M.C. Attle,1,05-Jan-17,3 people found this helpful,I have very sensitive skin prone to dehydration  and this stuff is turning into a saving grace for the winter months. It feels slightly cooling going on  and it has both a slightly moisturizing and slightly occlusive feel to it. I do use at least one lighter hydration layer with it most days  but if I ve tried something that has made my skin mad  I revert to a two step routine - cleanse and moisturize - using this cream. It s a definite repurchase for me. I do wish they had stuck to the tubs  though  as tubes are always harder to get all the product out of.
10611,Amazon Customer,0,31-Mar-16,,I don t like how the product feels on my skin but it does help your skin. I just don t think I would buy this again.
10612,Jackson,1,15-Mar-18,,This just got along with my skin. It s not too thick and not too thin. My skin absorbs it well. I use this only for day time before I put on my sun screen. And it keeps it looking dewy all day. A little goes a long way.
10613,mary,0,18-Dec-17,,Heard good tings and wanted to like this  seems pretty moisturizing- but the main thing that I just can t get over is that it smells like diaper rash cream you get in the US. terrible smell  didn t seem like a good enough payoff for me to overlook the awful smell
10614,Hannah,1,19-Mar-18,,My absolute favorite moisturizer since discovering Lush s Imperialis. It is most definitely light-weight and soothing. I deal with hormonal acne and this moisturizer complements my sensitive/acne prone skin care routine in both the morning and night time. It is a bit pricey for a such a small tube  but I watch the price and stock up when it drop below $20!
10615,Amazon Customer,1,19-Dec-18,,I got to say I get mix skin  dry and very oily because of my large pores and acne. Ever since I have been using this moisturizer  my skin looks amazing  moist and not oily at all. They did a really good job with this moisturizer.
10616,AlinaD,1,27-Jul-18,,This worked very well to keep my skin hydrated and didn t irritate me at all. I also use Klairs Vitamin E Mask  which is almost finished. My biggest peeve is that it didn t last very long  had to cut the tube to get more product out. For that I m not sure that I would repurchase.
10617,A.B.,1,26-Aug-17,2 people found this helpful,I love this snail cream! I use it as the last step in my night routine  and it works wonderfully. The smell might be a bit strong if you are sensitive to fragrances (the smell is kind of cucumber-y)  but I don t mind it at all. It absorbs very well and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and bouncy. This is a product that I like enough to have re-purchased when I ran out!
10618,Maresness,1,11-Apr-18,One person found this helpful,Love this! It’s thick but goes on feeling light. It hydrates my skin. The scent is fresh & pleasant and not overwhelming. Not to mention the packaging is so lovely. The price is the best and it arrived as promised.

10621,Amazon Customer,1,13-Jul-18,One person found this helpful,I used it during the winter and my skin soft and moisturized. I stopped using it during the summer because I did not need the the extra moisturizer. Will be using it again soon
10622,Amazon Customer,1,02-Jun-16,3 people found this helpful,I have sensitive skin so I have to be watchful of the products that I use. It ll give me a sting when I first apply it  but it ll quickly go away. It does not irritate my skin after my application nor does my face turn beet red.
10623,Paula S.,0,18-Aug-18,2 people found this helpful,2 of my daughters tried this. one with sensitive skin and on without. Both ended up with severely dry skin. The sensitive skin one ended up with burns on her face! This is not a good product to use.
10624,Maddi,1,09-Mar-19,,Unfortunately this broke out my skin. My pores are easily clogged  so I don t blame the product at all. I m sure it s a great cream  it s just not for me.
10625,TinyMumMa,1,14-Feb-17,,First time trying this and I love it! My skin has never felt soooo moisturized!!! it smells amazing too! I must restock. Even my LO complimented on how nice it smelled. BUY IT!
10626,Baokang Xiong,1,17-Jun-17,,Love this product. I usually buy it from the Missha website but when I received a $100 gift card to Amazon  I bought it from here to see if it was legit. I compared the one purchased through Amazon to one purchased through Missha and its identical. Ive started purchasing this product on amazon because its cheaper.
10627,Kindle Customer,1,21-Nov-16,,very light  goes on smooth  absorbs quickly. I would say this is more of a summer product. I use it under MISSHA sun block and combined these two provide what I need for the day.
10628,Cheryl,1,18-Sep-16,,What can i say. This is a wonderful moisturizer that leaves your skin fully moisturized all day. And that s not all  it smell absolutely amazing. Recommend to everyone.

10630,.....( _ ),1,15-Jan-17,3 people found this helpful,I was skeptical about using snail mucin but I have to admit it has made a difference in my skin. My appearance looks so much better  my face is so much softer and I was having sO much trouble in my T-zone with dryness  I couldn t find a cream that would work and take away the dry patchy areas but this worked perfectly. I was hesitant about ordering this on amazon bc I read a review about whether it was legit and it is if anyone is wondering. I ordered this from amazon and then ordered from the MISSHA website  same exact product with same exact packaging and everything except with better pricing. I also received my product way ahead of the time estimated and packaging was in one piece. I am very happy with this cream  the only thing I do not like  but don t mind is the after feel is a little sticky; but if it works I am okay with the sticky.
10631,May Gee,1,13-Apr-16,,Super hydrating!! I had really dry skin and this completely rescued my winter dryness! It does take a while to absorb into the skin though. And it does leaves a bit of stickiness that last about 30 minutes after application. I use this if I want my makeup to have a dewiness effect.
10632,Mercedes Lee,1,11-Feb-18,,Love it.
10633,S. Thompson,1,22-May-16,,I was skeptical about something called  snail cream  but after using it for 6 months this gel moisturizer is amazing! It moistures  makes skin look supple  and is very soothing to my rosacea-prone skin. It s also great at healing breakouts.

10635,Tina Liu,1,03-Oct-15,2 people found this helpful,The packaging is nice and there s no damage.

I know the idea of putting snail mucin on your face is sort of gross  but this cream is awesome. It really moisturizes my face. I put it on at night and wake up with super soft and hydrated skin. I like the sort of citrusy smell and don t find its fragrance too overwhelming. I will definitely be purchasing this again.
10659,Kelsey Rae,1,10-Jul-16,,Excellent night pack. I put this on at night after I ve applied the rest of my skin care products. Locks in moisture and really helps reduce dryness  blemishes and imperfections.
10660,lilida,1,01-Apr-13,One person found this helpful,Missha s Super Aqua Cell Renew Snail Cream has made my face and neck velvety smooth. It definitely has changed the texture of my skin  but at this point I have not really noticed any tightening or firming effect. Overall  the skin is improved and I m very happy with the product. Will order it again.
10661,Amazon Customer,0,22-Apr-16,3 people found this helpful,I purchased this product because I was excited to try a snail cream after hearing so many great reviews and I figured Missha would have a reliable one. Unfortunately  one day after using the product  I noticed that my skin felt VERY irritated  acne-prone  and itchy. I have oily-combination skin and I usually don t react to new products but this one was a disaster. The container also didn t have a protective covering under the lid?? It s a shame because the packaging and smell (like lychee jelly) was so nice. If you want to purchase this and have a similar skin-type  definitely test it on your neck and hands first or you might end up with red  itchy skin like I did :(
10662,Q. Zong,1,12-Aug-13,,I like the flavor of the mask  like lily flower favor. Fresh after a night of sleep. You feel the freshness.

This is worth it weight in gold for a skin aficionados like myself who has been using products for the past 32 years. This is sublime for it leaves your skin moist and refreshed with out the shine that some products leave. As the winter draws upon us it is the ideallic product for the weather. This has now been added to my Christmas gift list to be passed on to treasured friends for it was a treasured friend that into diced me to it. I in tune have to pass this treasure along.
10664,K. Baker,1,06-Jan-15,3 people found this helpful,This cream absolutely works! It claims to be a wrinkle and redness reducer and it CERTAINLY does all that. I m 48 y/o and had a lot of redness and the texture of my face was t at all great. This cream improved all of that for me over time of course and it is worth the patience needed to apply it daily.. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!! In fact this is the only line I use and friends have been asking me what I m using... They can t believe how much younger I look and neither can I!!
10665,Meme,1,23-Feb-14,2 people found this helpful,I just received the cream today. So I decided to go directly to misshausa.com (which written on the box) to check out the price. I saw that you can get the whole set (3 items) for 36 dollars. I guess Amazon is not always cheaper

10667,Gina Marie,1,10-Jul-14,11 people found this helpful,I waited a few months before writing this review because I really wanted to be accurate. I love this product because I feel like it gives back the moisture to my skin that is naturally lost  and it is not creamy and heavy- it is more like a gel. I use the  First Time Essence  as a toner to introduce moisture (first every time before the snail cream)  then I use this remarkable Snail Cream that goes on like silk and really plumps my skin  and I finish with an OTC product from Eucerin (I ve been using alone for almosts 20 years) for sensitive skin that contains Shea Butter and the very essential SPF these Korean products lack. I love the trio and my skin hasn t ever looked better  certainly not in a loing time. I am 45 years old  healthy  and take care of my skin/body but I don t obsess. I find these products low maintenance and very effective- good for my sensitive and aging skin. Economical for what it is and how far it goes!!!! I truly recommend.
10668,Bonnie Lau,0,19-Sep-15,One person found this helpful,Product did not come in a sealed box. It is a gel and not a cream. Would NOT buy again.
10669,Ananda Hongsa,0,15-May-16,7 people found this helpful,If you have sensitive skin  it is best to avoid this product because it has a lot of alcohol. It also deepened acne scars that weren t that visible today. It is a thick gel that at first seems like it would be sticky but goes on very matte and gives a soft finish. It also evens skin tone in terms of redness and discoloration. However  the heavy amount of alcohol comes through because it stings the face for several minutes after applying and turns the face slightly red. I would not recommend this product.
10670,Mary Beckmann,1,05-Aug-15,6 people found this helpful,This product is great! I m usually a walgreens beauty product buyer so this was my first experiment with something a little higher-end. That being said  I do suffer from acne and acne scars and have used a long list of prescriptions (topical and oral) over the years trying to combat that. After using this product at night every night for a month  I feel confident going out everywhere without foundation on my face. It is a wonderful  free feeling. I also think getting some good sun has helped my acne as well. It doesn t smell  it s not goopy  and the tub lasts about a month and a half.
10671,DD,0,24-Oct-18,,I use this as a first layer moisturizer at night and it s effective. However  the gel is too thick for me and leaves my skin sticky and doesn t quite absorb fully (I use a toner beforehand). The main turnoff for me is the strong fragrance which leaves me smelling like an old lady when I go to bed.
10672,Amazon Customer,1,01-Jan-15,,I really like it lot.
10673,Mieu,0,27-Feb-17,18 people found this helpful,Full disclosure  I originally purchased this at Target since they began carrying it. Before trying it from Amazon I wanted to know what the for-sure legit product smelled like/looked like. In future when I re-purchase thru Amazon  I will update this review to confirm if it s a legit version that I receive!  ** UPDATE ** Just received my Amazon order. Uh oh. Nope. Bottle  package look NOTHING like what I bought legit from Target. Cream smells the same but since I can find no evidence it was ever sold in packaging like this  I don t trust it and am sending it back. VERY disappointed in this seller for not showing pictures of what you ll actually get  which clearly looks nothing like the real jar. *********  This gel (yes  way more gel than cream) is absolutely excellent. I have a severe oily T-zone and somewhat dry cheeks/forehead; classic combo skin. I am starting to get baby fine lines  and wanted to nip that in the bud without resorting to peptides just yet. First two days wearing this and it is blowing all my other products away. I use tons of serums/lotions and face masks in general  all of which make me look better for maybe a few hours? This actually evened my skin tone out fully for a whole day  plumped without making me look like a baby  and did not make me more oily. It really feels like I m healing my skin  rather than just conditioning it with excess moisture. It doesn t roll up or flake when you rub your face or apply make-up. It has a smell very similar to Neutrogena Aloe Gel body lotion  if you re familiar with that little drugstore product :). It s heavy at first but fades right away. It isn t gooey or slimy AT ALL so if you re afraid of snail products  this is a very comfy beginning product. It is pricey for how little you get  but so far a little is going a very long way.
10674,Jenny,0,26-Nov-17,One person found this helpful,I hate this product. It makes my skin itchy and red and also made me break out. I really wish I didn t purchase this item/ open it so I can return it. It says this product helps with acne but it does not. It makes my skin break out more (and I rarely get acne) and it makes my face oilier. It makes me feel unclean and unsatisfied after cleansing. This product is not worth the hype.. I didn t like the texture or the smell  really nothing special.
10675,MissyMe,1,04-Mar-17,2 people found this helpful,I have to say i really like this stuff. Feels great  very smooth and silky. No irritation (like i was worried about being from a snail & having semi sensitive skin). Not miracle worker  but definitely a nice added addition to my skin care regimen. A little pricey for my liking  but until i find something different/better i will most likely continue to use at this price or lower.
10676,Laura,1,26-Mar-17,One person found this helpful,This is one of the best face creams I have EVER used. I just bought a second jar. I also sent one to my mom. The only complaint I have is the smell. It s a bit strong but I deal with it because of how amazing it makes my skin look and feel. My skin is soft  smooth and acne free. My pores are minimized. My skin looks 10 years younger. It s extremely soft. My acne scars are significantly less noticeable. Please try this cream you will not be sorry!
10677,Samantha H.,1,08-Oct-17,One person found this helpful,Love the smell of this product! It makes my skin feel so nice and moist for most of the day  if not all of the day. I use it in the morning and at night. I started using this with other korean beauty products and my face has not been dry and peeling in over 2 months.
10678,Momo,1,24-Jan-17,2 people found this helpful,One of my favorite new skincare products! I am new to Korean skincare and wanted to try out snail mucin for my combination oily woc skin. I m prone to minor breakouts and dehydrated skin and this stuff brings my skin back to life. It s very light but somehow also very hydrating and renewing. I think it s a great deal for a nice skin cream too!
10679,Amazon Customer,1,24-May-17,,I love this stuff. The cool feeling on my face and neck is great and I love it with my other Missha products in the morning and at night. I can really feel and see a difference in my skin. It s more smooth  soft and supple.
10680,Alison Rockett,1,19-Oct-18,,The smell and the way my skin is much more hydrated is amazing. This was my second time to purchase this product. I love it!
10681,JOO LEE CHOE,1,24-Jul-16,2 people found this helpful,Unfortunately  it made me break out but it smelled nice and went on smoothly on my face. I liked the feel of the cream on my face.
10682,CClark16,1,09-May-16,,This is what I put on my face after all the eye cream and face moisturizer and toner. It seals in the moisture and doesn t make me break out. My skin looks amazing after only a few weeks of these products!!
10683,DJ Richards,1,06-Sep-17,,This stuff is the bomb. Goes a long way and feels cool on the skin. Super moisturizing.
10684,NE_MN,1,10-Jan-16,One person found this helpful,Snails are my new heroes. Love the texture and results. Already recommending it to my friends after only a month as the results already show.
10685,Melissa,1,06-Jan-17,,Love this stuff! Makes my skin feel soft and supple...and the jar is so pretty! It looks much more expensive than it is (maybe I ll start buying jars of this for gifts! :) )
10686,Queenie,1,11-Jun-12,7 people found this helpful,I just received this last Wednesday from Seoulglamour in korea and I have been using it every night since. I know it s only been 5 days but I must say that it is diminishing the acne scars on my cheeks. It looks more shallow and filled in by plumping your cells and providing moisture and regenerating the cells. I m going to try other snail creams when I m done with this jar.
10687,Aaron Yan,1,25-Mar-16,,Incredibly light and moisturizing. Only need a small scoop (comes with a plastic scooper) to moisturize the face after washing. My skin stays moisturized the whole day and I can t even tell it s there.
10688,SB,1,07-Apr-15,,This cream is very cooling  calming & moisturizing without clogging your pores. My acne-prone skin has been doing great with this so far. A little bit goes a long way. My skin is glowing and smooth - and those are just the immediate effects. The price is also good. Will stick with this.
10689,Ernie Kimlin,1,25-Jan-18,,Feels great on the skin!
10690,Amazon Customer,1,16-Nov-16,,one of my favorite moisturizers right now. I have a acne prone skin and everytime i put this on day and night my face always feel so fresh and hydrated. I feel like it s been helping me soothe my redness and scars. would DEF recommend
10691,Jennifer,1,26-Feb-17,,Smell really nice. This makes your skin so smooth! Would buy again!
10692,Kara,1,23-Mar-19,,Loved the smooth gel and feel on my face  my skin felt super hydrated and fresh!
10693,Dominick,1,23-Oct-16,,The smell is refreshing and the gel goes on my face smoothly.
10694,NM,1,02-Jul-15,,I really like this product. Seems to be doing a great job hydrating my face. Highly recommended.
10695,Kate,0,08-Oct-15,,It always stings slightly when I put it on and seems to dry out my skin...
10696,Amazon Customer,1,06-Dec-16,,this is my 2nd tub and i personally love it even though im bad at noticing the differences. but i love the feel & texture it gives when i put it on! smells and feels good! very lightweight and gentle!
10697,Ashhoa,1,17-Sep-15,,Love the smell of this product! Very light weight  soothing product.
10698,r.gary,1,01-Feb-16,,I love how soft my face is when I use this. I am on my 3 jar.
10699,mushupigs,1,30-Aug-16,,Purchased for my mom who has dry skin and she loves. I like the smell of this but it was too rich for my skin.
10700,Savana,1,31-Aug-15,,One word.....FABULOUS....my skin looks and feels great ;)
10701,Amazon Customer,1,14-Aug-17,,In love with this product  smells so good!
10702,star grace,1,13-Dec-16,One person found this helpful,Makes my skin smooth!
10703,Christine Au,1,02-Nov-16,3 people found this helpful,REALLY MOISTURIZING. Ever since I got this product I have not stopped. I use this everynight with no moisturizer and wake up with soft supple skin. Yes snail cream might sound frightening but the frgrance reminds me of aloe gel and I love it. A SMALL TINY BIT goes a long way. I lightly tap my finger in the cream and it can easily cover my whole face because of it s thick consistency. I would recommend this product to those with dry skin!
10704,C.,1,06-Jul-15,One person found this helpful,Good
10705,b p k,1,23-Feb-16,,This is a gel great for combo skin. It has a strong fragrance but it is a very good over all smoothes and softens skin.
10706,Flamingoprinces,1,04-Dec-16,,I ve been a Missha user for about a year now and I ve seen great results.
10707,Amazon Customer,1,16-Nov-17,,Very satisfied with my purchase
10708,Masha,1,27-Jun-15,2 people found this helpful,This is a very gentle product  but it does what it says it will. I have very sensitive  rosy skin that s also breakout-prone. This tones down the redness  moisturizes without any grease or stickiness  and really helps rejuvenate skin also. No breakouts since I ve been using it (several weeks). I ve tried several snail gel products and this is my favorite moisturizer.
10709,Heidi Weiss,1,09-Dec-14,One person found this helpful,Goes on beautifully. Smells nice and really seems to hydrate.
10710,Roxana,1,20-Aug-15,,Two words  LOVE IT
10711,Nucharin Chomphukham,1,24-Jan-16,,great product. I use it when I m so sleepy and lazy to apply my night cream.
10712,Carmen C.,0,14-Mar-17,5 people found this helpful,The results of the product are moisture rich  bouncy  radient skin. MWA! I am not one who likes fragrance in skin products  so that is a star off for me. A light scent is okay  but I would prefer my night cream not smell like watermelons. love that it comes with a little spatula for sanitary upkeep. The jar is very pretty  but it is chunky and makes you think that you get more product than you really get. 47 mLs for about $30! Woof! I am going to try the Mizon and Cosrx snail creams and see if they truly are comparable in results because from what I see  they are about $15 for 75-100 mLs AND the percent of snail mucin is higher than the Missha. We will see. I will update my review to 4 stars if not. Update 7/11/17: The Cosrx is better in all ways. Downgraded this to 2 stars.
10713,Sybil,1,22-Dec-16,One person found this helpful,I use this after time rev lotion and night ampoule  which is similar to the sheet mask I love. My skin doesn t break out anymore. I follow with plain jojoba oil mixed with sandalwood essential oil since I live in the high NM desert. My skin has no problem with the dryness here  which is kind of miraculous.
10714,Amazon Customer,1,28-Jul-15,One person found this helpful,For over-50 skin that tends to be dry  this is a great product. I have been using it for a little over a month on a daily basis as part of my morning routine in conjunction with vitamin C serum (which goes on first). My skin has definitely become more hydrated  feels firmer and looks smoother.
10715,Robert Stern,1,19-Aug-15,,Soft skin and easy to use
10716,Anita Wong,1,21-Oct-15,3 people found this helpful,Although the content of this product still makes me a little nauseous  I appreciate that no part of this jar reminds me of snails. It smells pretty great and I love the bottle design. It s fall now and my skin is very supple. My exfoliate a bit less often now  because I don t notice too much flaky skin issues.
10717,T.D.,0,12-Jan-17,,This did not work well for me at all. It caused unbearable burning and stinging  I had to immediately wash the cream off.  It s a bummer because I was so excited to use it. I don t regret buying it  I m constantly trying new skin care products and have sensitive skin. Anyway  I gave it to my sister because I couldn t find the box it came in and also I was too lazy to send it back.
10718,Amazon mom,1,10-Sep-15,,Love it. This is the only moisturiser that has not clogged my pores. It is enough for my combination skin but dry skin beauties will need to layer it with another moisturiser. It does make the face shiny so cant use it standalone during daytime. Also  it seems to heal some of my acne scars.
10719,Godwin Wong,1,28-May-16,,I have very sensitive skin and not many products work well for me and moisturize enough. This product is very gentle (no breakouts!) and moisturizes my skin very nicely. I m going to keep purchasing it as the price is very reasonable as well.  This vendor provides timely shipping and good customer service. 5 stars all around!
10720,Naoko McGlothlen,1,25-Feb-14,2 people found this helpful,This gel type cream is so moist! I like it very much. Skin feels very soft after you put it on your face.
10721,Wutipong,0,20-May-15,One person found this helpful,I don t like
10722,Amazon Customer,1,28-Apr-15,One person found this helpful,Had a really awful chemical smell - almost like gasoline! I was afraid to use it so it went right in the trash.
10723,proreader,1,15-Dec-15,5 people found this helpful,My absolute favorite finishing cream. I have combination skin and when I use this my skin is impeccable  feels great  looks great  not oily  not tight  not dry  just perfect. I use it as the last step in the day time  and at night by itself or under a sleeping mask. Sometimes I layer it over an emulsion. No matter what I do  it works great.
10724,Jack C.,0,06-Dec-15,2 people found this helpful,I like the gel-like consistency and the smell. However  I had an allergic reaction to this product where my jaw chine  and around my mouth broke out in hives and small white bumps. My careful if you have sensitive skin
10725,FaithHealer,0,02-May-16,,I don t understand what the rave is about. This cream a.k.a gel is absolutely not suitable for oily skin. My skin stays shiny and even oilier after applying. The smell is nice though.
10726,JCKC,1,19-Jul-15,,Feels Soft  refreshing  moisturizing and smells great. Good product for the price.
10727,TMon,1,01-Jun-15,,I ve only used this for 4 days. And I can feel the difference my skin feels more supple  bouncy & I can see some of my wrinkles receding or their filling up my laugh lines & under eye.
