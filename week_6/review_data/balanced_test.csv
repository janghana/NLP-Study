,,1,,,I use this product every morning and evening and I love it! I have more oily skin so it helps to keep my face feeling clean and refreshed without drying it out like other face washes. A little goes a long way with this product as it creates a nice lather with water. It has a nice  subtle scent as well. The only disclaimer is that it has no effect on hormonal acne. Acne related to oil and dirt  however  would be better managed by this product  I imagine. Will definitely continue to use as a part of my face-cleansing regimen!
,,0,,,My wife and I used it for three days  and both of us have skin rash and small red dots appeared on our face... we definitely are not going to use it anymore.
,,0,,,it was for my father who has a skin condition and the cream did not work as well as we had hoped it would.
,,1,,,I love innisfree  it always have this pure scent and cleans my face so well. this is the second time i purchase it. I thought it would be bigger but is fine  I just need to use a drop of the product and I can clean my face because just one drop has a lot of soap is so good. I tried a sample the first time and since then I can t stop using it. So sad that it didn t come with other samples this time haha
,,0,,,I love this cream BUT!!! When I received this box it was smashed inside the envelope  cream was everywhere. The box it came in was shredded. I m so mad that I spent so much and over half the bottle is gone from this mess!
,,0,,,I really wanted to like this  the texture is great  no fragrance and makes a good barrier like it s name. After a few days I started getting tiny red dots all over my face that later turned into pimples. It took a good two weeks for the reaction to go away even after I stopped using it. Not for sensitive skin.
,,1,,,I have oily  acne-prone skin. I love Innisfree products  so I figured I d give this one a shot. Unfortunately  the Green Tea Pure Cleansing Foam was so moisturizing that it clogged my pores and caused me to break out. However  if you have dry skin  I m sure this product would be amazing. It smells FABULOUS and your skin feels soft after rinsing it off. I gave it to my husband and he says it feels good on facial hair.
,,0,,,I can t get over how overwhelmingly perfumed this product is. Putting this on is like getting punched in the face. Texture and hydration wise this meets my needs but this does not smell like green tea to me at all...just perfume. I have decided this will be my neck or hand lotion since it s a little bit more bearable away from my face.
,,0,,,Hate this product. It does clean very well however in a way that hurts your skin.
,,0,,,kind of sucks  lotion doesn t last very long on skin not mosturizing
,,1,,,I love this! First off a little but goes a long way  a very small amount will be enough to clean your face  second if you have sensitive skin this is perfect for that  the wash doesn t have much harsh chemicals or an overpowering smell and the formula goes very nice on the skin.
,,1,,,I have been using this product almost a week. Almost immediately  I noticed that my skin felt very soft. I didn t have a lot of acne or break-outs before  but my skin is really clear after using this. I would recommend it to anyone. 1 piece of advice: a little goes a long way. I would only use about the size of a pea  maybe less.
,,0,,,This product is a fake. The tube I received is plastic and the cream texture is different. It doesn t moisturize the way the original Dr. Jart does  don t buy it. It s more expensive but you can find the original product at Sephora and Birchbox.
,,1,,,This is a wonderful light (emphasis on light/runny) lotion that s great for summer time. The smell of this is amazing (I wish it was available in a spray form). I think the lotion would be more suitable for people with oilier skin. Because the bottle has a wide opening  it keeps the freshest during the first 2-3 months  after which the scent starts to fade.
,,1,,,This toner makes my skin soft. Can t tell it s on my face because it s light. Some reviews complain about the scent. I don t know why. It doesn t really have a strong scent. Not sure if it will help oilyness of my skin but I ll keep using.
,,0,,,I m sure this product works well for those with acne-prone skin  etc but I have sensitive dry/combination skin leaning towards dry  and it actually makes me break out like crazy. I tried to use it for about a week but it just kept getting worse. Later on  I bought a Clarisonic face brush and tried to give it another try. Even after the initial period where a lot of people break out  it kept happening. I switched to using Clinique s mild cleanser and everything went back to normal.
,,0,,,Makes my eyes water all day - annoying and difficult to manage my day. Had to get rid of it. It has a long list of ingredients have no idea what I'm allergic to and I've never been allergic to anything...
,,0,,,I was hoping this lotion would work for me because it smells nice (a bit masculine  though  so some people may not like that) and it s very lightweight. However  it was sticky  didn t feel very moisturizing  and caused me to break out.
,,1,,,I m starting to fall in love with Innisfree Products! This cleaning foam is gentle and takes all my make up off in one go. Right after I get off work  I use this to take my make up off and it leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth. Not to mention it has a lovely smell - some may not like it  but I love it. Green tea all the way!
,,0,,,I guess I should have done more research before buying this. As other reviews have said  the balancing lotion is very very thin. I honestly don t like how it feels on my skin. I have given it a few chances and it just feels really weird  unlike any other lotion I ve used. It s basically just so light that it s watery  and rather than absorb nicely into the skin  it sort of forms a top layer that eventually dries or evaporates and it leaves me feeling kind of tight. It reminds me of the feeling of alcohol drying on skin. Not pleasant. The smell is also very strong and it does not smell like great tea to me. It smells like some kind of bargain price perfume. I see that this product has somewhat of a cult following but I just don t get the hype. I ll probably just throw it out.
,,0,,,Just like other reviewers have stated  this product caused a severe rash all over my wife s face. Buyer Beware!
,,1,,,i bough it because i saw a korean girl youtube video  i wasn t waiting to much of it  but after wash my face and aplying it 7 times before sleep for about a week (i didn t use moisturizer)  my skin looks more hydrated  i have veins under my eyes and thin skin  now they are less visible  and more filled
,,1,,,Perfect for Texas weather
,,1,,,Amazing face wash. It does not make face too dry or too oily. Instantly leaves ur face when washed with water unlike for some face washes which u need to wash 2-3 times.
,,1,,,It s somewhat fragrant but I love the smell anyways and it s a great simple moisturizer. Haven t broken out since using it and I have acne prone skin. However it doesn t moisturize my face enough to the point where I want to wear it all year round. Perhaps the summer  but I think I m gonna buy something else for winter.
,,1,,,feels really nice to apply on my face! but it does get dry quickly. wish it gives more moisturizing effect. i have to apply this twice whenever i wash my face. but i like the smell  like how it gets absorbs nicely (doesn t sit around on the skin layer).
,,0,,,This is the 5th Laneige cream I bought from the same seller. The cream I bought this time is significantly different from the others. The box was not wrapped by a plastic membrane  which the manufacture always does. Instead  it was wrapped by a simple tape (see the pictures  the left one is the one I just received). When I opened the container  the cream looks odd and different from the one I am using right now. I am not sure the cream is still the same  but it does look different and feel different (definitely less moisture compared to the previous one). Since I opened and tried  I am not able to return it  but I may not buy the cream from this seller again.
,,1,,,Refreshing and clean. Does not make my skin oily at all throughout the day but stays hydrated. I ve had problems where some skincare lines would make my skin oily as the day progressed. This is my 4th time ordering this and even in the summer time where the hot weather can make your skin oily fast has had no affect on me. My skin just stayed hydrated and never oily.
,,1,,,Its nice and hydrating and the smell isn t terrible for me personally. I love this brand and had always worked for me. However next time i might try some other eye creams like brightening or anti-aging. but this was perfect for the cold winters when my skin get dry.
,,1,,,I love this facial cleanser. I have been using it for a couple years now and it works well for dry  sensitive skin.
,,1,,,I like this cleanser. It has a soft smell and a wonderful lather that makes me feel like I m getting my skin extra clean. Because it lathers so well  a little bit goes a long way! It is gentle and doesn t burn or make my skin feel tight. I have enjoyed adding this to my Beauty routine!
,,1,,,I use this after I ve double cleansed  and it makes my skin feel less dry and it s very soothing to the skin. It makes my skin glow  and I just love Innisfree s Green Tea line. My boyfriend tried it too  so he s obsessed with it as well. I would really recommend this product.
,,1,,,Great lotion
,,1,,,This is perfect for sensitive skin. A little really does go a long way. However  the moisturizer isn t great if you have a oily T-zone. It doesn t  balance  that part of your skin. On the other hand  it is very hydrating and does the job. I love it.
,,0,,,Don t like it. It stays on the skin feeling sticky. Won t soak in. I want my money back.
,,0,,,Seal was already broken when I received the product.
,,0,,,After reading the reviews I thought this moisturizer would work great for my dehydrated skin. While my skin hasn t gotten worse since using this cream  I haven t seen any improvement. Not worth the price. It s causes my makeup to slide around quite a bit.
,,0,,,It was so thin
,,0,,,I have very very dry skin and this cream like a vaseline. I don’t like it
,,1,,,It s been three months and I still have over half of the bottle left. I use it twice a day. Great price for a lot of product. I have dry skin and acne-prone skin. This did not break me out and it kept my skin hydrated and moisturised. After using this  I felt a noticeable change. My skin became softer and plumper.
,,0,,,Maybe it just didn t work for my skin type  but this product was horrible! I used it for about two weeks and I cannot continue to use it any longer! To begin my face broke out in acne! Horrible big  red acne! I had not had a problem until I started using this. Then my face started to get ridiculously dry  which seemed to defeat the purpose! A friend had talked wonders about this product  so I figured I d give it a try  but it did no wonders for my skin  and that was really disappointing. I was really looking forward for this to be great since my friend has really perfect skin  but I guess this is just not for my skin type. Maybe it can work wonders for others. I guess the only  good  thing is that it smells really nice and the texture is not bad at all. But again  it made be breakout so bad and dried my skin even more. Not for me.
,,1,,,This is literally the best face wash. After you wash you feel cleansed and not dried out. Innis free has great products
,,0,,,Knock off! DO NOT PURCHASE
,,0,,,Too thick on the skin. Made my face feel pasty even with very little application. Moved back to VaniCream and happy again.
,,1,,,its a good product and works as describe  no adverse reaction
,,1,,,I recently discovered the K-beauty skin care regime and I am hooked for life. Double cleansing is making my skin look younger than it ever has before! I currently use an oil-based cleanser followed by this item and my skin is certainly happy for the change! This cleanser is gentle but foams up nicely. Normally  foaming cleansers strip my skin out horribly  but this item doesn t! My skin stays moisturized and feels clean and silky smooth. I have rather large pores and I have seen them shrink to half their size in most areas and my t-zone is starting to lose the appearance of pores altogether. This cleanser is gentle enough for daily use and has reduced my acne considerably! I actually am starting to have the skin I thought I would at my age. If you struggle with acne and are looking for a wonderful cleanser certainly give this a try! It came directly from Korea? so it did take some time in the post but the wait will not keep me from reordering!
,,1,,,I ve been using this for a few months now  and I love it! I have so much product left  too. The lotion itself is thin  a bit runny. It glides over the skin easily  and a little goes a long way. Not greasy  has a pleasant smell. I have combination skin with cystic acne  and I ve found it doesn t exacerbate my oily spots  or my acne.
,,0,,,Too tightening and harsh on my pores. Doesn t smell like green tea at all. Wouldn t buy again.
,,1,,,This product are the best and through Amazon you can get the brand name/original as well as there website from innisfree
,,0,,,I have bought this product before multiple times and each time the product looks the same a lighter blue and very thin consistency. When I put the product on its weightless and never makes my face break out. However the product I just received was white in color very thick and made my face break out! I honestly chalked it up to the company possibly revamping the product and changing the consistency. So I decided to order it off the Belif website when I received it the product was the same as it always was. I even contacted the company to find out if anything changed and maybe I was getting an older product. I was told it was still the same. So..DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!!! They are replacing the actual product with who knows what! I wouldn't trust anything you get from this place.
,,1,,,I have struggled for a long time to find a moisturizer that compliments my sensitive skin. Since using this my skin has evened in complexion and my breakouts are amost completely gone. A little bit goes along way with this moisturizer and I m so happy that I tried it!
,,0,,,This product gave me a major allergic reaction with puffing and swelling under both eyes to the point I could not open my eyes comfortably nor sleep. It also caused severe bumps to develop all over my face and even my neck. It has persisted now for over five days  even though I ve stopped using it. Finally starting to calm down after a week.  Don t know what chemical that is causing this major reaction  but was very scary for a while to the point I was considering going to doctors.
,,1,,,Great green tea scent  didn t break me out. Gel-like consistency  non greasy.
,,1,,,For the price  this is a nice Green tea wash. It doesn t seem to make my rocasea break out  either. It feels moisturizing when you put it on your face.
,,0,,,The ph of this was too high and while it gave the squeaky clean feeling it dried my skin too much. I have oily-combination  acne-prone  and sensitive skin and this product was a bit too harsh for me.
,,0,,,If you have a sensitive skin  please Do not buy this product. After using this product  I got too many pimples on my face and also allergical reaction. I cannot even use any itchy cream for allerge because of pimples. I feel very pain and cannot even see myself. The picture does not show allergical readction well but i had that on all over my face even neck.. It was getting worse.
,,1,,,I happen to be someone who has acne prone skin from foods I eat. Usually  a strong regimen of intense acne care is what does the job to get rid of my acne. Sadly  it leaves my skin dry. But this product... WOW. Usually  I m peeling healthy skin off after my acne washes  but this green tea moisturizer stops that. My skin feels super soft after using this product. It also feels refreshed and lightweight! I highly recommend using this if you re like me with using drying acne products or have super dry skin. And personally for me  I don t have sensitive skin  so I am unable to give feedback on if it s good for sensitive skin. I only have to tap the bottle 3 to 4 times to get out enough to cover my whole face and I ve been using it since February. Three months in and it still looks like I ve barely touched the bottle. So a little goes a long way! Overall  I love this product!
,,0,,,Don t know if it strips moisture or leaves a residue but either way  it gives my skin that feeling of having sap on your skin (to a lesser degree though) (don t know how else to describe that feeling).
,,0,,,I ordered this product and recieved a glasses case i did not order in the mail. I do not know how that occured however it was quite annoying and i did not order it again although i did recieve a refund.
,,0,,,Love this stuff but the product was already open when it arrived. Didn t need to use the puncture lid to puncture the top since it was already open....now I don t want to use it.
,,1,,,To buy a friend  she said great Hope to continue to maintain good quality and price. Thank you!
,,1,,,This toner is gel-like. 1st time i used a toner like this. It smells really good but gentle on the skin. I use the whole green tea line and it makes my skin glow and prevent my acne from erupting esp on my first 2mos of use. But now im on my 3 rd month  it doesnt clear my pimples well enough like before. But its really nice on skin.
,,1,,,I used it now more than 1 year. This is the best for my skin. I apply it on my face thoroughly so 1 bottle lasts one month.
,,0,,,I've been hearing a lot about Korean beauty products lately so I thought I'd finally try one. I used Belif for the first time this evening and I doubt that I will try it again. There were three problems: (1) it does not apply well. From my point of view a good moisturizer should be very light and the skin should absorb it rapidly. This product does not absorb well it feels greasy and my skin was sticky and irritated after application. I do have mature skin but it is not sensitive or resistant to new products. (2) If you haven't seen a complete list of the ingredients I suggest that you review them at the product's home site. I looked up most of the non-plant derived substances and found them all to be safe. However I'm a little put off by a product that is for rubbing into your skin if it has more than 15-20 ingredients. This one has about 60. Most of them are plant-based (raspberry leaf extract chickweed extract alchemilla vulgaris leaf extract willow bark extract etc.) Many users see plant products and think they are getting something natural. Maybe but a product that has so many chemicals on top of a lot of plant extracts may not be what's best for your skin. (3) I'm not that fond of the scent imparted by this product either. I've seen reviews from other users who complained of an overpowering herbal-citrus scent. All in all disappointing. I really wanted to like it but there were too many obstacles.
,,0,,,The item received was a fake. Box was unsealed whereas the real product is sealed. The type font was all wrong. The ingredients were in the wrong language. Returned immediately. Buyer beware!!
,,0,,,Instructions in Chinese
,,1,,,It cleans the skin very well. Love it
,,1,,,This is my favorite new skincare discovery! I have extremely oily skin and cystic acne - which has not been as much of an issue after using this product. Leaves my skin feeling super soft and squeaky clean. Smells amazing too! Will definitely buy again and plan on trying the serum and balancing cream soon!
,,0,,,I think this item is fake. It tried the one my friend got from Korea and it feels totally different. This one s a lot more watery. And it definitely did not give me the same result as hers. I was really excited when I thought I could get it on Amazon.. but it was a total disappointment.
,,0,,,My first impression of the cream was greasy to the skin.
,,1,,,Great product  actually it works on ur skin.. feel soft  & brighten ur face  lighten ur dark spots..planning buy second one. Smells good.. lightly scented which is pleasant. Feels lik organic..??????
,,0,,,Not really a lotion is more like a liquid. Doesn t moisturize..
,,0,,,Not for me. The fragrance is so strong  I could smell the perfume of the face wash before I even opened the bottle. It burned (not literally) the sensitive spots on my face--I had to rinse it off immediately. It left my face feeling stripped of moisture like when I use a bar of bath soap (and not Dove soap).
,,0,,,I got this on last Friday and opened it today. When I opened the box  the lid of cream was opened. I checked the color of cream  and it was too dark compare to other Dr. Jart Ceramidin Cream I got before. I also checked the scent  and it had different smell compare to the other one. I m so afraid to put this cream on my face. There s no guarantee of the cream. I doubt that this is not  a real  one. I m strongly asking to compensate of it.
,,1,,,I have oily skin and have been using this the last two weeks. I also am not a fan of the squeaky clean feeling  but found that compared to my old cleanser  which didn t leave my skin with that feeling immediately after  my skin didn t produce as much oil later on. With it being summer now  I m not interested in my face feeling stickier than it needs to be. Not a holy grail  but I m happy with it and the smell.
,,1,,,I use many other Innisfree products  but unfortunately this cleanser was too drying for my face. I gave it to my roommate  who has never used a facial cleanser before  and she loved it! After washing her face with it  she said she didn t want to put any makeup on because her face felt so nice and clean. :P
,,0,,,I paid the extra money to get the Morning Cleanser  meant to be a gel cleanser  because I don t like foam cleansers. Instead  I received the foam cleanser.
,,0,,,Horrible artificial fragrance. Smells like cheap men s cologne from the grocery store. Regret my purchase.
,,1,,,Nice and foamy. My skin is oil less once done
,,0,,,It is fake  the fragrance is not the same as the original product. I m so disappointed!
,,0,,,Product looks used and does not look anything like the picture!! The product looks old as well. This was very underwhelming. I plan on returning it. I am very disappointed :(
,,0,,,Is no real!
,,1,,,This is my third try with the Innisfree product. My first try was the Green Tea Body Lotion  and I love it. The body lotion made me fall in love with the Green Tea line. This one is also an amazing product. Smells good  not greasy and good for oil to normal skin. But it s not moist enough to use in cold days.
,,1,,,I usually buy this product over and over since It cleaned so well. I do not need to use makeup remover. The smell is awesome and is it so refreshing. I recommended it to one of my friends and she loves it too.
,,0,,,This product caused a major allergic reaction with swelling and puffing under both eyes to the point I could not keep my eyes open comfortably nor sleep comfortably. It also caused bumps all over my face and neck to occur. It took a week of not using the product before my face finally started to calm down. Don t know what chemicals they have  but it was not good and caused much anxiety during the episode.
,,1,,,this product was AMAZING i bought 2 and will definitely by more after I use these up. They don t leave my skin feeling dry and coarse. After I use it my skin feels super velvety and soft and it cleans all my makeup off without me having to use any extra makeup removers. The seller also included little samples of other innisfree products which was great!
,,1,,,The only company i use on my face
,,0,,,The smell of this product is amazing! They need to make a perfume of it. However  if you have sensitive skin I would not buy. I ve been using it for a few months and stopped this past week. I had started breaking out really bad since using the product. I thought it was stress from work and moving but since I stopped using this product my skin has cleared up. It s a shame cause it smells so good and was just the right consistency (not greasy  not to light). I m sure if you don t have combination  sensitive skin like me that this product will be great for you!
,,1,,,Smells great. Big bottle. Good value for the price; and it does a pretty good job as a toner - leaves face clean  refreshing  and not oily.
,,1,,,This product really leaves the skin feeling fresh and clean and super smooth after use. I m sure this will last me for a long time since a little goes a long way.
,,0,,,Used it for about a week and it made my skin peel. Will not be buying again.
,,0,,,Made my skin red and it tingled which is really surprising as I am not normally sensitive. Also leaves a greasy feel that never soaks in. I am returning it.
,,1,,,after a day s work   green tea cleansing foam feel very exhilarating   nice smell and feeling  easily remove all make up  a must buy item  thanks
,,1,,,Loved the effect
,,1,,,With the tiniest drop of this  spreading it over your face instantly leaves your skin soft and squeaky clean without feeling dry. The product does not lather but still cleans so very well!
,,0,,,It seems like a nice toner but my product did not come with a box..and the package was damaged...
,,1,,,Good if you want a non greasy  light moisturizer
,,0,,,Made my skin itch and made me break out more. Reallt disapointed because of the good reviews.
,,0,,,I really wanted to like it but my skin broke out like crazy! Zits starting to form in the beard area.
,,0,,,Has a nice consistency and a strong  yet pleasant smell... but it made me break out. At first  I wasn t even sure what it was that caused my pretty much clear skin to go crazy  then my sister told me that it made her break out and I realized it was the same for me. I have sensitive skin so I m assuming it was the fragrance in it but I don t know. I had high hopes for it  but it turned out to be a waste of money.
,,1,,,This product has been a god send for my skin. I usually have issues with products working for awhile and then feel as though it stops working. From start to finish this facewash has consistently given me that refreshed and clean feeling. The scent is incredible and I’m pretty sensitive to scents in products but it didn’t break me out or anything. I use this with a red clay Konjac sponge and my skin feels so refreshed.
,,1,,,I felt a difference right away. I could also see a difference. I have very dark under eyes and I saw that this eye cream brightened them instantly. It made the area around my eyes very firm and soft which is exactly what I wanted.
,,1,,,I liked the consistency and the fact that it wasn’t greasy. It didn’t brrak me out.
,,1,,,I’m not sure about the moisturizer part  but I just use this product to be my daily face wash because it is a light and more natural face wash for my face. Comparing to many of other product  this is the only product that I applied that actually treats my acne and still dry of my skin. ( I do apply moisturizer mist for other and this product)
,,1,,,I loved how my skin felt after using this product  super clean but not dry. Personally I do not like any scent in products so can t say it s overly scented just because I m sensitive to smells. Using it in conjunction with their Green Tea Serum and Lotion my skins felt wonderful  in fact I liked this so much I went and bought other products from Innisfree!
,,0,,,This product doesn’t have ingredients listed so I looked through the questions. The ingredients listed on their bottle is completely different then the one I received. This item actually has coconut in it which I am extremely allergic to. So money down the drain for me and I wasted over a week waiting to get a product I can’t even use!!!!
,,1,,,I love this stuff! I have combo skin  and use as my morning and night face wash. It’s not rough or dries skin out. Been using for about 2 years now and couldnt be happier with the product. I exfoliate twice a week while using this product.
,,0,,,I bought innis free from the physical stores in Asia before  they all have very pleasant smell  but the ones I bought on amazon smell nothing  the texture is different  and I start having out breaks. I never had such skin problem before I used the product.
,,1,,,I have oily skin with dark spots and roscea and it helps it feel so clean!! My skin is starting to get lighter  way faster than when I used rosehip oil by itself.  The smell is great  it s not strong; if it dries your skin try using a cream or moisturizer. This product did not dry out my oily skin.
,,1,,,I liked everything but the smell. I feel it has a strong scent somewhat like overly perfumey hand lotion. It is not a bad smell  just too strong for me (and I am not bothered by the scents of any of my other products).  It feels pleasantly cooling  calms my redness and has reduced oiliness. Soaks in nicely without leaving a residue. Feels very moisturizing but not heavy or greasy at all.  Very economical. Bottle is 160mL.
,,1,,,Good deal : )
,,0,,,After a while  due to the summer humidity  the cream felt a bit too heavy.. Started to breakout in about two weeks... I would use it if it was at a drier climate or if you have dry skin...
,,0,,,It made my skin feel bad. Like it was stripping all of the moisture but not actually cleaning.
,,0,,,I decided to take the Korean skin care plunge and after reading tons of reviews chose to give Innisfree a try. Specifically  this toner  and the Bija Trouble Cleansing Gel  Foam wash  and lotion. I had high hopes but what I got instead was a painful allergic reaction on my skin upon first use. Far from making my skin better it actually made it much worse.  The toner didn t feel too bad when I first put it on but my skin still felt kind of irritated. It went on after the cleansing gel and foam wash so I just thought it might be cumulative. By the time I finished all the steps my face felt awful. Tight and dry even after applying the lotion.  A raised red patch formed on my chin and around my nose. (See photo) I don t normally turn pink even from blushing or coldness so that s a pretty shocking reaction for my skin. I ve never had an issue with redness.  I did patch tests on my arms today to see if I could figure out if it was just one of the products. The area that I applied just the toner on looks okay but stings to the touch.
,,1,,,I liked the texture and smell  but it didn t really worked for my skin type. (I m mostly dry with some oily areas.) I didn t have any bad reactions to it  it just didn t make a difference either. I would still recommend it  just keep in mind that it might not do much for you if your skin is similar to mine.
,,1,,,I have been using this for a while  and I feel so refreshed every single time I do. This doesn’t break me out and does not have an irritating smell. The only thing is  I haven’t seen any difference in the appearance of my skin. But still  I think adding a step into your routine won’t hurt.! UPDATE: 10/1/18 STILL my favorite. I find that it helps just keep my face moisturized and really did balance out my skin ♥? Bought my back up! I have a lot left of my first bottle but these go fast!
,,0,,,I'm not sure what's in this (I have very oily skin in case that made the difference) but I received a large sample from Sephora and this literally made my face sting! At first I thought maybe it was an adaptation issue so I tried it for a few days but it didn't go away. I did not get any moisturizing benefits and my face felt like it was stung for hours after I applied.
,,1,,,Great cleanser - strong perfume but does a great job. I have very sensitive skin and this is gentle.
,,0,,,This product made me and my friend break out! I wouldn t recommend if you have sensitive skin.
,,0,,,This is a FAKE product. Immediately when I received the box I noticed slight differences in the packaging. The biggest thing was that the ingredients were written in a different language- as well as most of the other print on the box and container  When I opened the package I knew this was a knock off i have been using this product everyday for months and it was clear this was not what I had ordered. Everything from the texture  smell  consistency of the product itself was off.  Don’t waste your time or money on this sketchy product that does not even list its ingredients on the package.
,,0,,,The first bottle of the green tea cleansing foam I bought foamed up so much but the second bottle I bought barely foams up at all. My mom says the second purchase also doesn t have the same nice fragrance the first on had and that this one stings her eyes more. Maybe the product I got was fake. Don t plan on purchasing this cleanser again.
,,0,,,This product doesn t seems like the same product we got from Itaewon  South Korea. My wife used to like this product back in South Korea but this product somehow causes her acne after using it for few days. Don t waste your money from it.
,,0,,,This has a strong scent that gave me a bad headache.
,,0,,,very expensive
,,1,,,It’s light weight and it absorbs very quickly into the skin. It leaves a little glow after applying. Smells very good and the smell is not to strong.
,,0,,,Product was over a year old.
,,1,,,I have always loved the idea of eye cream  every time I use one I would have irritation. This is the first ever my skin feel in love with the eye cream. Its smooth and lovely. This cream is a game changer for me and is my holy grail of eye cream.
,,0,,,I received mine just yesterday and the package was already opened. When I opened the amazon box it was rolling around in there absolutely no seal on the product so I am hesitant to even try it...
,,1,,,It is always less to talk goodnesses about this product . I have been using this product for about a year. It is very natural  soothing and has enchanting smell in every use. I use it every day twice . All my friends and family has noticed the change in my skin which is amazing.
,,1,,,Works great
,,0,,,i was really excited to try laneige as i’ve heard so many good things...unfortunately after just opening and smelling the water bank cream i knew this product was a flop. it has a PUTRID floral scent  like cheap knock off elizabeth taylor perfume. I should have noticed that this product had added fragrance as it is listed in the ingredient list. I wore it for one day and just could not get over the fragrance. i’ve already sent it back for a refund.
,,1,,,Great product! Makes my skin feel very hydrated and refreshed. Light formula  great for sensitive and oily skin. The smell is light and pleasant as well. Update: I ve had a really bad stress rash/eczema behind my elbow for a couple months  and it was bleeding  scabbing  and very flakey and itchy. I applied some of this lotion as a last resort  not expecting it to work  but my skin was totally hydrated and the scabs were healing like magic. I don t know what makes this lotion so effective  but I wish I d thought of applying it to my rash way earlier. (Aside: I ve tried using Cortizone-- it made my skin flakey  but at least it controlled the itchiness. Because it is a steroidal lotion  I was reluctant to use this more than absolutely necessary.) The patch where my rash was is still discolored  but it is now properly hydrated and scab-free. I would recommend this as a last resort if anyone has eczema issues and wouldn t mind dropping $14 for a chance at relieving dry  itchy skin.
,,1,,,I love this brand and this does wonders for my skin
,,1,,,Fabulous! Most American foaming cleansers leave your skin feeling stripped and dry. I am writing an article on my 30 days following the 10 step Korean skincare routine and I really love this cleanser. It is very gentle on my sensitive combo skin. Beautiful formulation!
,,0,,,Recommended for sensitive skin/dermatitis. Triggered inflammatory response.
,,0,,,Purchased this because the reviews were rather good so I decided to give it a try. At first it feels very creamy when you work it up into a lather BUT when you rinse it off it gives the squeaky clean feeling that I absolutely hate. This means its stripping your skin of your natural oils. Wouldn’t recommend.
,,0,,,I tried to give this a chance and like this because the volcanic cleanser works so well for me  but whenever I use this  my skin almost always breaks out and feels itchy.
,,0,,,This was worthless to me especially for the price.
,,0,,,Great I love it keeps my skin moisturized
,,0,,,I’m extremely upset. This product is not for sensitive skin. I put this on my face and neck. My eyes swelled up. My skin got red and itchy. It was horrible. And you cannot return this product to Amazon. I wasted so much money on this product and it’s just sitting on my counter and I don’t even know what to do with it.
,,1,,,I just Love this Product  it makes your skin feel refreshed and moisturized. I use it all over my skin.
,,1,,,I have dry to combination skin as I ve lived in Las Vegas for at least 20 years now. This was excellent on my face - absorbed well  really moisturized it and the smell  at least to me  was TERRIFIC!! I also have very sensitive skin and I did not get any irritation from it at all. I ve tried many other Korean skincare products and this ranks as one of my top ones. The ingredients can be checked out at either cosdna or skincarisma.com.
,,0,,,After using this foam  my face is full of rash. Be careful when buy this product.
,,0,,,It was okay I don't think it's the real product. Doesn't smell like it and the consistency is not the same if you by it from a Sephora or department store. Don't risk it just go in store!
,,1,,,Using this product is well worth it and might I say is that a good 2-4  drops  goes a long way for use on my face. I purchased this product by being a little skeptical because just like any other facial products will just leave your face dry and no results. I use this at night before sleeping. I go warm water  cleansing  SKIN  lotion  cream  and sleeping pack. When I wake up I wash with warm water and pat dry gently then moisturizing with a different brand (that s literally it). But my face has been clearing up (my cousin even asked me what I used). I played sports in the sun and there was dirt  which also meant sweat + open pores= acne and black/whiteheads. Never really took care of it because I was just tired after practices & games. It was a slow progress  but you can t expect any product to work wonders in a second. It takes time. So I put my patience cap on and did my routine. Oh and great smell  plus it feels clean...no harsh smells or irritation. Give this product a try. I don t regret it. (:
,,1,,,Cleans great  doesn t leave my skin feeling dry at all  and smells so nice. Highly  highly recommend!
,,1,,,This is one of my favorite products EVER. I have the most difficult time finding facial products that will not irritate my skin and that have a pleasant scent. I cannot stand scents that are overpowering or intensely floral. This hits the perfect light and clean scent! It also melts into my skin and leaves it feeling clean and refreshed. No residue.
,,0,,,This lotion is heavily fragranced and irritating for a face lotion. The smell is almost overwhelming. It does not absorb well and leaves skin feeling tight once it has dried. I would not recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.
,,0,,,Been using this product for 4 months and have no visible difference. Two stars because the fragrance is nice and it feels good when you apply it. Almost feels like it’s going to add some moisture....
,,1,,,Smells great  feels great. Leaves skin feeling a little dry after but throw on some moisturizer after and you re good to go!
,,1,,,This is the one. THIS IS THE BEST MOISTURIZER IN THE WORLDDDDDDDD. I use it after cleaning my face  over night & even under makeup. It hydrates my skin and does not clog my poors. It’s light & it’s just great.
,,0,,,This product *looks* great but is very ineffective to start. Also  any product that is supposed to be green tea based should not smell like a bottle of cologne. The smell is unbearably strong and this is not something I want to put on my face. The ingredients are written in Chinese and to top it all off  the product cannot be returned (which I didn t notice because it was Prime) & I m sure this is because they want you to receive it fast and be stuck with it because it s complete crap). I don t even plan to pass it on  I m throwing it in the trash. Save your money  time  and face.
,,0,,,I don t know if I got a bad batch or a fake product but either way I m returning this. #1 - the tube did not have a safety seal  when I unscrewed the cap  it was already open + ready to use. #2 - as soon as I put it on my face  within 2 minutes my face was covered in a red  splotchy reaction that I ve never gotten with Dr. Jart Ceramidin Cream before. I love this product - but I m going to buy it from a more reliable source. Saving $10-$15 isn t worth damaging your skin.
,,1,,,Absorbs quickly  nice light smell. I have oily/combination sensitive skin and this stuff works amazing. It has no alcohol which is great too. Works perfectly under makeup  doesn t make you greasy but is still moisturizing.
,,1,,,This is my second time purchasing this cream and I must say I’m impressed. I did feel like it was a balancing cream. It does have a perfume smell (it doesn’t bother me). All in all a great purchase!
,,1,,,I m absolutely obsessed with this product! I ve heard great things about this brand  and their green tea line in particular  and this definitely did not disappoint! The packaging is simple  cute  and functional  and the product itself is amazing. My favorite thing about it is the smell. Even after I wash it off of my face  the smell lingers  even when I begin applying other products (though at that point it s faint). I usually use it alone  or as the second step in my double cleansing routine (first with an oil cleanser  then with this)  and either way  it leaves my skin feeling thoroughly clean and fresh. Not only that  but a little bit goes a very long way - I usually pour a little drop into one hand  wet my other hand  and then rub them together until it foams up before applying the foam to my face (a handy tip I got from a youtuber that definitely does the trick). With just a tiny bit of product  I get a ton of foam action - more than enough to thoroughly clean my entire face and neck. I imagine that with the very small amount you need to use  this product will last me a very  very long time  which makes it even more amazing  especially considering the price point. I m very  very happy with this.
,,0,,,Giving it one star because I received the product unsealed with dried product around the rim. I ve been using this product for over a year now and I love it  but receiving this open and unsealed makes me worry about this seller in particular. Will not repurchase from this seller.
,,1,,,I enjoy this a lot. It has good ingredients. It does smell like a man slightly.
,,1,,,I ve been using this for a few weeks now and I absolutely love it! I did a bunch of research on affordable Korean night lotions before purchasing and watched some Youtube videos where people compared some favorites. Eventually I opted to try this one. It s very light and refreshing on your skin and has been perfect for my normal combination skin. It also softened and smoothed my skin a bit and smells very nice. Highly recommend! Now if only I could afford one of those monthly Korean beauty box sets...
,,0,,,Gave my face an even oiler feel and made me break out. It just doesn t work for my skin I guess.
,,1,,,I love this product! Finally a soap that doesn t break my face out even after I ve used for months!!! My skin is really super sensitive and I love this stuff!! It is a bit drying  but a small price to pay.
,,0,,,Things are not good. Serious doubts are false. Not genuine
,,0,,,Only use it about 5 times so I ll come back to write an update review a month or so later. It doesn t seem to be as clean as CosRX good morning cleanser. I follow double cleansing with Heimish all clean balm  then a cleanser. When I use a pad with toner to wipe my face after cleansing  its usually clean with ZERO makeup/dirt left. But with this soap  every single time I ve noticed the pad slightly brown. Its a nice gentle type of smell  texture is cream to slight foam. Not worth $9. And I don t know what it is yet but I ve had a recent breakout. It might be this  July24th update (almost one month later): it s wrecking my skin. my horrible cystic acne has returned and honestly nothing else in my routine has changed. I happened to see a list of ph on most cleansers and this one s ph is 8.5! where as our skin s is between 4.5-5.5. it s dried out my chin and lip area  caused random breakouts and now this whole layer of painful cystic acne. I learned not to blindly listen to youtube people selling this stuff with their pseudo science of green tea  aloe blah blah blah
,,0,,,FAKE! Do not buy this from this seller! This caused my girlfriends face to breakout in a rash! Avoid at all costs!
,,0,,,I was really excited to try this  as an esthetician I do a lot of research and love to try products based on reviews  but this one left me feeling like there was a waxy  soap like residue on my skin. My teenage son agreed and we tossed it.
,,1,,,It s light yet moisturizes well...also a small amount spreads nicely on my face. It s an excellent product for any season.
,,1,,,Love it! Smells good and you really don t need a lot. Also doesn t leave skin too tight. You get a good amount of product too.
,,1,,,Not too thin or thick. Good price and great ingredients.
,,1,,,I like it! It makes my skin feel soft and well-cleansed  and hasn t made me break out any. Probably would be best for those with a similar skin-type to mine (normal to dry skin  low acne). I like to use this in the morning as it does seem to give the skin a bit of extra life & brightness to it -- great to start out the day  and then use a more deep cleanser at night.
,,1,,,Cant wait to use this! I heard a lot of good things about this product from innisfree. Fair price for korean product. Some products from korea are heck expensive  coz they are advance for skin care. Like one of the best skincare i’ve ever tried.
,,0,,,I have dehydrated skin. It feels tight but looks oily. The rave reviews about this made me purchase it. Welp I used it for about a week and in my cabinet it sits. It just didn t do the trick  it s not overly hydrating. It s more thick and like cerave PM for me. I need light but effective moisturizer. Not a fan at all.
,,0,,,i have combination skin and i ve noted this product drys my face out completely
,,1,,,My wife received her order  and she became a little bit confused. The cap of the product is white  instead of the original should be dark green. On the Innisfree website there are no products with white caps. Is it fake or not? This cream is quit good moisturizer.
,,0,,,Received the wrong product... was supposed to receive the cleansing face wash  but instead received a magnifer for jewelry..... how does a mix up like this even happen...
